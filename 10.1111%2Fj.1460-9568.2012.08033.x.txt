Abstract
Our current understanding of thalamocortical (TC) circuits is largely based on studies investigating so-called ‘specific’ thalamic
nuclei, which receive and transmit sensory-triggered input to specific cortical target areas. TC neurons in these nuclei have a
striking point-to-point topography and a stereotyped laminar pattern of termination in the cortex, which has made them ideal models
to study the organization, plasticity, and development of TC circuits. However, despite their experimental importance, neurons
within these nuclei only represent a fraction of all thalamic neurons and do not reflect the diversity of the TC neuron population.
Here we review the distinct subtypes of projection neurons that populate the thalamus, both within and across anatomically-defined
nuclei, with regard to differences in their morphology, input ⁄ output connectivity and target specificity, as well as more recent
findings on their neuron type-specific gene expression and development. We argue that a detailed understanding of the biology of
TC neurons is critical to understand the role of the thalamus in normal and pathological perception, voluntary movement, cognition
and attention.

Introduction
The gray matter of the dorsal thalamus can be subdivided into a
number of cytoarchitectonically-defined nuclei, the basic layout of
which is similar across mammalian species. Ascending input pathways
to the thalamus distribute in general accordance with these cytoarchitectonically-defined nuclear borders. For example, neurons activated
by input from skin mechanoreceptors are largely confined to the
ventroposterior complex, whereas retinal input readily activates
neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate (DLG) nucleus. Thus, nuclei
represent a key principle of thalamic organization and function
(Sherman & Guillery, 2005; Jones, 2007).
Despite the central role of nuclear parcellation in the organization of
thalamocortical (TC) connectivity, there is now ample evidence for the
presence of distinct TC neuron types within cytoarchitectonicallydefined nuclei (Jones, 1998, 2007; Rubio-Garrido et al., 2009). Such
diversity mainly involves differences in the tangential spread and
lamina-specific termination of TC axons in the cerebral cortex, but
also in the targeting of subcortical structures such as the striatum and
amygdala. At least three broad TC cell types (Herkenham, 1986;
Castro-Alamancos & Connors, 1997; Jones, 1998, 2007; Huang &
Winer, 2000) can be identified based on such axonal differences
(Table 1): intralaminar-type (IL-type), matrix-type (M-type) and coretype (C-type) neurons. Moreover, a further distinction can be made
between M-type cells with widely ramified axons targeting multiple,

distant cortical areas and M-type cells with an axon that arborizes
within a single or few adjacent areas (Rubio-Garrido et al., 2009)
(Table 1). Remarkably, these axonally-diverse neuronal subtypes are
found in most thalamic nuclei, albeit in markedly varying proportions,
such that a given nucleus can be defined by a typical complement of
TC neuron types (Fig. 1).
In addition to this hodological (i.e. connectivity-related) diversity,
there is now ample evidence for diversity in the somatodendritic
morphology of TC neurons (Jones, 2007). Although the intermingling
of the distinct TC neuron types within the thalamus and the overlap of
their axonal projections in the neocortex have long hampered the
correlation between somatodendritic and axonal phenotypes (LeVay &
Gilbert, 1976; Penny et al., 1982; Avendan˜o et al., 1985, 1990;
Mitani et al., 1987; Rausell et al., 1992; Rubio-Garrido et al., 2007),
new labeling techniques now open the possibility of correlating, at the
individual cell level, axonal architecture, somatodendritic shape and
even gene expression. As examples, juxtacellular labeling (Pinault,
1996; Noceda et al., 2011) and low-titer viral transfection (Kuramoto
et al., 2009) allow single-cell labeling of identified long-range
projection neurons and open a new window for our appraisal of the
diversity of TC neurons (Galazo et al., 2008; Kichula & Huntley,
2008).
C-type neurons are the most widely studied type of TC neurons. Their
highly topographic wiring and laminar target specificity are consistent
with their role in the accurate and spatially precise ‘bottom-up’
transmission of inputs, either from ascending systems to primary
cortical areas, or from primary areas to other areas higher in the
hierarchy of cortical processing, via cortico-thalamo-cortical

connections (Sherman & Guillery, 2005, 2011). Such topographic
wiring along with the robust responsiveness to peripheral stimulation,
even under anesthesia, has historically made C-type neurons the focus
of virtually all experimental and modeling studies on TC systems. In
fact, C-type neuron anatomy and function are still widely believed to
represent the thalamus as a whole, despite the evidence that such
neurons are a minority outside the sensory relay nuclei (Jones, 2007;
Rubio-Garrido et al., 2009) (Fig. 1B). The wiring and functional
properties of other TC neuron types remain at present poorly understood
(Theyel et al., 2010). The widespread divergence ⁄ convergence and
specific laminar pattern of termination in the cortex of M-type cell axons
are consistent with the view that they may support descending (‘topdown’) corticocortical interactions via the thalamus, and ⁄ or the
synchronization of spatially distributed assemblies of cortical neurons
in cognition and memory (Crick & Koch, 1998; Jones, 2001; Hawkins
& Blakeslee, 2004; Rubio-Garrido et al., 2009; Saalmann & Kastner,
2011; Viaene et al., 2011). IL-type neurons, in turn, may be part of
multisynaptic basal ganglia loops, but simultaneously provide innervation to the motor and limbic cortex (Parent & Parent, 2005).
In recent years, TC pathways have become major models for studies
of axonal guidance, cortical specification and plasticity in development; careful consideration of TC neuron diversity is relevant for a
thorough understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms
controlling TC circuit formation. In the following sections, we will
review emerging evidence for a broad diversity of TC neuron
subtypes, with regard to their connectivity and morphology, but also in
terms of their molecular identity and developmental biology.

historical review, see Jones, 2007). Subsequent electrophysiological
and connectivity studies, conducted mainly in experimentally-accessible nuclei such as the such as the somatic Ventroposterior nucleus
or visual Dorsal Lateral Geniculate nucleus, reinforced the notion of
a rather strict point-to-point spatial correspondence between the
neuron soma location in the thalamus and the axon distribution in
the cortex. Overall, these observations led to the concept of thalamic
nuclei being cytoarchitectonically-circumscribed regions receiving a
specific set of afferent fibers and projecting topographically within
the borders of a specific set of cortical fields.
However, early work by Lorente de No (1938) using Golgi stains
had already suggested that, whereas some presumed TC axons enter
the cortical gray matter at a single point to innervate a small cortical
region, others branch in the subcortical white matter to enter the gray
matter at several locations; he called these TC axons ‘specific’ and
‘non-specific’, respectively. Subsequent connection-tracing studies
(Herkenham, 1979, 1986; Caviness & Frost, 1980; Macchi et al.,
1996; Rubio-Garrido et al., 2009) indicated that, whereas some
thalamic nuclei contain neurons whose axons target one or few
adjacent cortical areas, other nuclei innervate wide regions of the
cerebral hemisphere. Such extensive innervation may result from
populations of neurons in a given thalamic nucleus projecting to
different cortical regions (Spreafico et al., 1987; Cappe et al., 2009) or
from neurons projecting to multiple cortical targets. Mounting
evidence from rodents and primates suggests the latter scenario
(Descheˆnes et al., 1998; Rockland et al., 1999; Gauriau & Bernard,
2004; Kuramoto et al., 2009; Noseda et al., 2011; Ohno et al., 2011).

Diversity in axonal branching and target specificity of
thalamocortical neurons

Laminar target specificity of thalamocortical axons

The most consistent criterion for distinguishing distinct subtypes of
TC neurons is their axonal distribution, including (i) the tangential
spread of their axon in the cortex, (ii) the cortical laminar target
specificity of these axons, and (iii) the presence or absence of axonal
collaterals to subcortical structures.

Tangential spread of thalamocortical axons
Classical studies of TC connections based on lesion methods have
suggested that the projections from each nucleus of the thalamus
were circumscribed to specific regions of the cerebral cortex (for a

Marked differences exist in the targeting of TC axon terminals to the
distinct neocortical laminae. Although the intracortical axonal arbors
of TC neurons are complex and evidence from detailed single-axon
reconstruction studies is still limited, each of the main TC cell types
has a distinct laminar pattern of projection (Table 1, Fig. 1A). C-type
neurons have a profuse arborization in cortical layers III–IV (and, to a
lesser degree, upper layer VI), M-type neurons have a characteristic
subpial arborization in layer I (and usually also in layer III or upper
layer V) and, finally, IL-type neurons arborize in layers V and VI, with
an occasional extension into supragranular layers (Killackey & Ebner,
1973; Jones & Burton, 1976; Herkenham, 1980, 1986; Frost &
Caviness, 1980; Berendse & Groenewegen, 1991; Shinoda et al.,

These differences in laminar targets imply that the distinct TC
neuron subtypes contact specific neurons and dendritic domains within
the cortical microcircuit, and, consequently, may have different

postsynaptic transduction mechanisms or computational value (Castro-Alamancos & Connors, 1997; Spratling, 2002; Llina´s et al., 2002;
Larkum et al., 2004; Petreanu et al., 2009; Meyer et al., 2010; Viaene
et al., 2011). For example, TC axons terminating mainly in layer IV
may target spiny stellate neurons and apical dendrites of layer VI

neurons (Jones, 2007), whereas axons terminating in layer I may target
the apical dendritic tuft of layer II, III and Vb pyramidal neurons
(Kubota et al., 2007). In the highly sublaminated visual cortex of
primates or carnivores, laminar compartmentalization of TC afferents
has been shown to be even more specific, with distinct C-type neuron
varieties selectively arborizing in precise sublaminae of layers II–IV
(Freund et al., 1989; Boyd & Matsubara, 1996; Callaway, 2005).

Presence of subcortical collaterals
A third aspect of phenotypic diversity among TC cell axons is the
presence or absence of collateral branches to non-cortical forebrain
structures such as the striatum and amygdala (Fig. 1A). As all TC
axons extend across the striatal gray matter on their way to the cortex,
the question as to whether thalamostriatal projections represent axonal
collaterals of TC neurons or in fact originate from a distinct, specific
set of ‘thalamostriatal’ neurons remains controversial. The few singleaxon reconstruction studies available to date indicate that most
thalamostriatal projections arise from TC axon collaterals, but also
reveal that specific subsets of TC neurons extend their axons across
the striatum without branching (Descheˆnes et al., 1996, 1998; Parent
& Parent, 2005; Galazo et al., 2008; Kuramoto et al., 2009; Noceda
et al., 2011; Ohno et al., 2011). In addition, specific subsets of TC
neurons send collaterals to the amygdala in non-tonotopic auditory
nuclei and adjacent multimodal nuclei (Namura et al., 1997; Doron &
Ledoux, 2000; Gauriau & Bernard, 2004). Moreover, whereas
subcortical collaterals to the striatum or amygdala seem limited to
M-type or IL-type neurons, the neurons in all thalamic nuclei extend
collaterals to the reticular nucleus. Together, these data indicate that
distinct subtypes of TC neurons extend axonal collaterals to specific
subcortical targets, although the molecular mechanisms controlling
this process are unknown.

Diversity in the somatodendritic morphology of thalamocortical neurons
The TC neuron morphology as revealed by Golgi stains or intracellular dye injections appears roughly similar throughout the thalamus,
even in different species. TC neurons typically show a multipolar
soma with numerous and highly branched dendrites with a radial or
bipolar distribution, which give the cells a characteristic ‘bushy’
appearance (Fig. 1B). On closer inspection, however, consistent
differences in soma size, dendrite length, thickness, and number have
been noted, even within single thalamic nuclei (Jones, 2007). Two
broad morphologies can be identified: neurons with a large soma,
thick axon and abundant and profusely branched dendrites, and
neurons with a smaller soma, thin axon and slender ⁄ sparse dendrites.
As a striking example of these morphological differences, TC neurons
in the DLG nucleus of carnivores and primates can be divided into
different morphological cell types (Guillery, 1966; Hickey & Guillery,
1981; Saini & Garey, 1981; Garey & de Court, 1983), which have
distinctive membrane conductances and relay specific retinal signals
(Crunelli et al., 1987; Boyd & Matsubara, 1996). However, major
departures from the stereotypical ‘bushy’ morphology have been
reported in TC neurons of the intralaminar (Deschenes et al., 1996;
Parent & Parent, 2005), ventromedial (Monconduit & Villanueva,
2005) and some non-tonotopic auditory nuclei (Smith et al., 2006).
Such TC neurons have much longer, less numerous and less ramified
dendrites. In motor, sensory and associative thalamic nuclei of
carnivores and primates, the neurons innervating layer I are significantly smaller than those in the same nucleus innervating only deeper

cortical layers (LeVay & Gilbert, 1976; Carey et al., 1979a,b; Penny
et al., 1982; Fitzpatrick et al., 1983; Rausell & Avendan˜o, 1985;
Mitani et al., 1987; Avendan˜o et al., 1990; Rausell et al., 1992;
Hendry & Yoshioka, 1994), and giant TC neurons with widespread
cortical projection have been reported in the medial geniculate nucleus
of carnivores and the pulvinar nucleus of monkeys (Huang & Winer,
2000; Imura & Rockland, 2007). Similarly, a recent single-cell virusmediated labeling study in the rat ventral anterior nucleus (Kuramoto
et al., 2009) has revealed that the neurons projecting to superficial
cortical layers of the motor cortex have significantly less profusely
branched dendrites than neurons projecting to deeper cortical layers.
Whether this correlation between laminar target specificity and cell
morphology is the consequence of integration into a specific TC
pathway, or reflects different aspects of neuron-type specific differentiation programs remains to be investigated.

Molecular and genetic diversity of thalamocortical neurons
Compared with the evidence for the hodological and morphological
diversity of TC neurons, data on the neuron-type specific expression
of gene transcripts or proteins are more limited. Although recent work
has begun to shed light on adult and developmental gene expression in
the distinct nuclei of mice and monkeys (Nakagawa & O’Leary, 2001;
Migliore & Shepherd, 2005; Sugino et al., 2006; Murray et al., 2007;
Horng et al., 2009; Diez-Roux et al., 2011; Yuge et al., 2011; SuzukiHirano et al., 2011; Otsuka & Kawaguchi, 2011), our current
understanding of the molecular identity of the distinct subtypes of
TC neurons largely rests on serendipitously-identified genes. This is in
contrast with the state of research in the neocortex where, despite a
tremendous cellular diversity, striking progress has been made over
recent years in our understanding of the molecular identity and
developmental controls over the distinct subtypes of projection
neurons (Molyneaux et al., 2007; Hattox & Nelson, 2007; Miller
et al., 2008; Fame et al., 2011).
Calcium-binding proteins have historically been widely used as
molecular ‘markers’ to identify distinct subtypes of TC neurons. In
most nuclei of monkeys and rats, Calbindin 28K is expressed by the
TC neurons projecting to layer I but not those innervating cortical
layers III–IV (Rausell et al., 1992; Hashikawa et al., 1995; RubioGarrido et al., 2007). In contrast, in many thalamic nuclei of primates,
another calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin, is expressed in groups
of TC neurons largely complementary to those expressing Calbindin
28K. Together, parvalbumin-expressing and Calbindin 28K-expressing cells are believed to encompass the whole population of TC
neurons in macaque monkeys (Jones, 2007). Moreover, at least in the
sensory relay nuclei of macaques, parvalbumin-expressing TC neurons innervate layers II–IV. However, this correlation cannot be
extended to rodents, where virtually no cell in the dorsal thalamus
expresses parvalbumin, or to carnivores, where parvalbumin is
expressed not by TC cells but by the intrinsic interneurons. Finally,
calcium-dependent calmodulin kinase 2a has been shown to be
specifically expressed by neurons in some laminae of the monkey
DLG (Hendry & Yoshioka, 1994; Jones, 2007), and the calmodulinbinding protein Purkinje Cell Protein 4 (PCP4) is expressed in discrete
nuclei of the adult monkey (Murray et al., 2007). Despite their
widespread use as molecular markers for distinct classes of thalamic
nuclei, the functional significance of the segregated distribution of
these calcium-binding proteins remains unknown.
Beyond these ‘classical’ markers, a recent gene expression screen in
the adult macaque thalamus has systematically compared gene

expression in select nuclei, identifying several genes with a nucleusspecific pattern of expression (Murray et al., 2007). Similarly, early
postnatal gene expression has been compared in the mouse DLG and
medial geniculate nucleus (Horng et al., 2009), a recent study has
examined the expression of select hypothalamic genes in the
embryonic and postnatal thalamus (Suzuki-Hirano et al., 2011; Yuge
et al., 2011), and the Eurexpress consortium has identified several
genes with mutually exclusive expression in the early (postconceptional day 14, ‘E14’) embryonic thalamus (Diez-Roux et al., 2011).
Candidate genes identified in these and other (Nakagawa & O’Leary,
2001) studies have a very broad ontology, and include transcription
factors, extracellular matrix-related proteins, and synaptic ⁄ membrane
gene products. Although these findings provide an important foundation for our future understanding of TC neuron diversity, the
functional relevance of these candidate genes has generally not been
examined (but see Horng et al., 2009), and whether they are involved
in the generation and specific differentiation of distinct subtypes of TC
neurons remains unknown.
There is now ample evidence for parcellation of the embryonic
thalamic neuroepithelium and mantle zone into distinct gene expression domains (Nakagawa & O’Leary, 2001; Bluske et al., 2009; DiezRoux et al., 2011; other articles in this Special Issue). Although these
distinct progenitor domains have been shown to give rise to excitatory
projection neurons (dorsal thalamus) or inhibitory interneurons
(prethalamus: reticular nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus
and zona incerta), no marker or combination of markers has been
shown to identify neurons destined to populate specific thalamic
nuclei. Likewise, although the emergence of anatomically distinct
nuclei during development is believed to result from transient
anisotropic patterns of expression of regulatory genes and cell
adhesion molecules (Nakagawa & O’Leary, 2001; Murray et al.,
2007; see other articles in this Special Issue), direct evidence for such
processes is largely lacking. At later stages of development, however,
some genes are progressively expressed within the thalamic nuclear
boundaries (see references above), but the correspondence of these
markers with the subtypes of TC neurons discussed here is unclear.
Differences in gene expression such as those highlighted above are
probably at the root of the distinctive morphology and connectivity of
TC neuron subtypes. It is likely that the use of recombinant (e.g.
Cre ⁄ lox) genetic techniques allowing fate mapping based on the
combinatorial expression of multiple genes will in the future
contribute to our understanding of the lineage relationships and
molecular biographies of the distinct TC neuron subtypes.

Electrophysiological diversity of thalamocortical neurons
Studies in different mammal species have shown that TC neurons
display roughly similar general membrane properties. These include a
resting potential of around –60 mV (Turner et al., 1997; Aguilar
et al., 2008; Li et al., 2003; Bartlett & Smith, 1999; Smith et al.,
2006), input resistance of 55–80 X (Turner et al., 1997; Smith et al.,
2006), and firing threshold of about )40 mV (Turner et al., 1997). In
addition, TC neurons have a low-threshold Ca2+ conductance that
allows burst firing when the cell membrane potential is more negative
than )65 mV (Descheˆnes et al., 1982; Llina´s & Jahnsen, 1982;
Sherman, 2001). At more positive membrane potential levels,
however, the neurons enter a tonic firing mode that is thought to be
critical for the accurate transmission of peripheral information.
Moreover, interactions between this and other membrane conductances allow TC cells to display different intrinsic rhythms, like the
slow (0.5–4 Hz) (Nun˜ez et al., 1992), very slow (0.05–0.2 Hz)

(Leresche et al., 1991) or spontaneous high-frequency (20–80 Hz)
oscillations at membrane potentials of )45 mV (Pedroarena & Llina´s,
1997).
As previously mentioned, virtually all of these studies were
conducted in the lemniscal divisions of the main sensory relay nuclei.
Although such nuclei turn out to be almost exclusively populated by
C-type cells, some studies have described different functional response
profiles. For example, in the visual and somatic relay nuclei, specific
subsets of TC neurons were found to respond to brief peripheral
stimuli with rapidly adapting (transient) discharges, whereas other
neurons responded with slowly adapting (sustained) discharges (Yen
et al., 1985; Turner et al., 1994, 1997). There are as yet virtually no
studies in non-lemniscal nuclei correlating differences in membrane
properties with TC cell somatodendritic and axon morphology (Smith
et al., 2006).
Overall, the situation is in contrast with cortical projection neurons,
where recent studies have revealed striking electrophysiological
differences between otherwise similar-looking pyramidal neurons of
the same cortical layer (Christophe et al., 2005; Molnar and Cheung
2006; Hattox & Nelson, 2007; Miller et al., 2008). These cortical
studies show that, in principle, beyond a basic similarity in electrotonic properties due to similar somatodendritic morphology, different
electrophysiological properties may result from the specific combinatorial expression and ⁄ or subcellular localization of ion channel
proteins. We think it thus quite possible that more detailed analysis
of membrane conductances in TC neurons beyond the classical relay
nuclei may in future reveal specific conductances and ⁄ or membrane
dynamics that are associated with the various TC neuron types.

Developmental diversity of thalamocortical connectivity
In the past two decades, projection neurons of the thalamus have
become key models to study developmental axonal guidance, activitydependent pathfinding and plasticity, and cortical area specification
(reviewed in Sur & Rubenstein, 2005; Price et al., 2006). All of these
studies, however, have focused on rodent thalamic nuclei that contain
predominantly or exclusively C-type neurons, typically the VP and
DLG nuclei. These studies have revealed that TC axon growth cones
navigate rapidly across the prethalamus and medial and lateral
ganglionic eminences to enter the pallium, where they fan in the
intermediate zone in roughly straight trajectories until they reach the
subplate (SP) underlying their cortical target area (Lo´pez-Bendito &
Molna´r, 2003; Lo´pez-Bendito et al., 2006). Once in the SP, growth
cones turn superficially and their advance slows markedly. Axons
usually give off some short branches in the SP and the deep layers of
the cortical plate (Fig. 2), where transient functional circuits are
thought to be established (Kanold & Luhman, 2010). In carnivores
and primates, the cortical neurogenesis and migration processes of
which are much more protracted than in rodents, C-type neuron axon
progression into the cortical plate virtually stalls in the SP for several
weeks (the so-called ‘waiting period’) (Rakic, 1977; Shatz & Luskin,
1986). In rodents, carnivores and primates, ingrowth, arborization and
synaptogenesis of C-type axons in the middle cortical layers is
relatively slow-paced, and remarkably precise from the outset (Agmon
et al., 1995, Yamamoto et al., 2000).
Although much less is known about the developmental connectivity
of M-type thalamic neurons, the few studies investigating axonal
pathfinding processes in these neurons have shown clear differences
with C-type neurons (Galazo et al., 2008; Kichula & Huntley, 2008)
(Fig. 2). Although at early developmental stages the axons of M-type
and C-type TC neurons cannot be distinguished, cortical invasion

Fig. 2. Schematic developmental sequence of axon arborizations in a
multiareal M-type TC axon (magenta lines) targeting two separate areas of

is shown by blue lines. (A) Sketch of the M-type cell extending its axon from

proceeds distinctly. In TC neurons that target multiple distant cortical
areas, multiple arborizations develop from interstitial branches that
sprout perpendicularly from axon trunks under the appropriate cortical
regions (Galazo et al., 2008). Cortical areas located more proximally
on the axonal shaft are not necessarily innervated first; in posterior
thalamic nucleus neurons, branches to the somatosensory cortex
sprout later than branches to the motor cortex, despite the fact that the
main axonal shaft of these neurons first has to extend under the
presumptive somatosensory cortex to reach the dorsally situated motor
cortex (Galazo et al., 2008). Therefore, even within a single axon,
mechanisms exist that regulate collateral sprouting in an areadependent manner. Interestingly, branches to the striatum, although
very proximal on the axonal shaft, sprout later than cortical branches,
further suggesting tight site-specific control over axonal collateralization.
The layer-specific targeting of the M-type axon arbors is
remarkably selective; they cross layer IV or VI without branching,
but arborize from the outset in their appropriate target layers (I and
Va) (Galazo et al., 2008; Kichula & Huntley, 2008), suggesting that

they respond to different guidance signals, or react to the same
signals in a different manner, than C-type axons (Yamamoto et al.,
2000; Maruyama et al., 2008). In the case of the tangential
arborization in layer I in rodents, the radially-ascending growth
cones pause for about 48 h upon arrival at the layer, then take a 90 °
turn and begin a fast subpial extension and branching (PorteraCailliau et al., 2005; Galazo et al., 2008).
Although, in the fast-developing rodent brain, M-type and C-type
axons have been observed to invade and arborize into the cortex on
about the same day (Galazo et al., 2008) (Fig. 2), it is worth noting
that, in the slow-developing cortex of carnivores, the timing of cortical
invasion and layer-specific arborization by M-type and C-type axons
is strikingly different. In cats and ferrets, C-type axons wait for several
weeks in the SP, as mentioned above, whereas M-type axons extend
rapidly across the cortical plate to arborize and make functional
synapses in layer I, weeks before C-type axons even begin entering
their target layer (layer IV) (Shatz & Luskin, 1986; Kato, 1896, 1987;
Clasca´ & Sur, 1996). As SP neurons are thought to play a critical role
of transient scaffolding of TC circuits (Kanold & Luhmann, 2010), it
is interesting to speculate that differences in the nature of interactions
with SP neurons could contribute to the distinct connectivity of C-type
and M-type TC neurons in the adult cortex.
It is currently unknown whether C-type and M-type TC neurons are
equally affected by non-cell-autonomous processes such as cortexderived signals or activity-dependent signals from the periphery. For
example, whereas the genetic reassignment of cortical identity by the
ectopic expression of the morphogen fibroblast growth factor 8
(FGF8) leads to a mirror-like duplication of S1 and corresponding
branching of (otherwise unbranched) C-type ventroposterior medial
thalamic nucleus axons to both areas (Shimogori & Grove, 2005), it is
unknown how this affects M-type S1-projecting posterior thalamic
nucleus axons.
Along the same line of thought, although several genes have been
shown to play a critical role in the axonal guidance and connectivity
of select C-type nuclei (e.g. 5 hydroxy-tryptamine transporter
(5HTT) or adenylate cyclase 1 (AdCy1) in TC neurons of the
ventroposterior complex) (for review see Lo´pez-Bendito & Molna´r,
2003), it is not known whether loss of these genes, when broadly
expressed, also affects M-type neurons. Similarly, although
input ⁄ activity-dependent processes have been shown to play a
critical role in the assembly of C-type TC circuits, it is essentially
unknown how peripheral input affects M-type TC neurons. For
example, peripheral sensory deprivation in the trigeminal system
induces rapid and dramatic changes in the TC arborization of C-type
axons innervating the layer IV ‘barrels’ in the mystacial vibrissae
representation of the rodent in S1 (Jensen and Killackey, 1987;
Catalano et al., 1991), but whether this affects S1-projecting M-type
neurons in the posterior nucleus of the thalamus has not been
examined.
Finally, beyond its basic importance in the understanding of TC
circuits and physiology, a detailed understanding of the molecular
mechanisms that account for the diversity of TC projection neurons
will probably be critical to understand the neural basis and evolution
of normal and pathological perception, voluntary movement, cognition and attention. Indeed, TC neuron dysfunction has been involved
in a number of neurological disorders, most notably absence seizures
(Beenhakker & Huguenard, 2009), but also in cognitive or neuropsychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, Tourette’s disease and
chronic pain (Llina´s et al., 1999; Albin & Mink, 2006; Jones, 2010).
As some of these disorders have been linked with genetic defects in
human patients, it will be interesting in future studies to investigate
whether genetically-based abnormal differentiation of specific TC

Slow waves represent one of the prominent EEG signatures of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and are thought to play an
important role in the cellular and network plasticity that occurs during this behavioral state. These slow waves of natural sleep are
currently considered to be exclusively generated by intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms within neocortical territories, although a role for
the thalamus in this key physiological rhythm has been suggested but never demonstrated. Combining neuronal ensemble recordings,
microdialysis, and optogenetics, here we show that the block of the thalamic output to the neocortex markedly (up to 50%) decreases the
frequency of slow waves recorded during non-REM sleep in freely moving, naturally sleeping-waking rats. A smaller volume of thalamic
inactivation than during sleep is required for observing similar effects on EEG slow waves recorded during anesthesia, a condition in
which both bursts and single action potentials of thalamocortical neurons are almost exclusively dependent on T-type calcium channels.
Thalamic inactivation more strongly reduces spindles than slow waves during both anesthesia and natural sleep. Moreover, selective
excitation of thalamocortical neurons strongly entrains EEG slow waves in a narrow frequency band (0.75–1.5 Hz) only when thalamic
T-type calcium channels are functionally active. These results demonstrate that the thalamus finely tunes the frequency of slow waves
during non-REM sleep and anesthesia, and thus provide the first conclusive evidence that a dynamic interplay of the neocortical and
thalamic oscillators of slow waves is required for the full expression of this key physiological EEG rhythm.

Introduction
Slow waves and their neuronal counterpart, the cortical and thalamic oscillations between depolarized UP states and hyperpolarized DOWN states (Steriade et al., 1993a; Contreras and Steriade,
1995; Petersen et al., 2003; Sirota and Buzsa´ki, 2005; Crunelli et
al., 2012), are the main EEG hallmark of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep (Crunelli and Hughes, 2010; Brown et al.,
2012) and are also observed during anesthesia (Chauvette et al.,
2011). The physiological importance of these waves of natural
sleep is emphasized by their ability to group together other EEG
rhythms of non-REM sleep (Steriade, 1997) and by their putative
role in the consolidation of recently acquired memories (Tononi
and Cirelli, 2001; Marshall et al., 2006; Ji and Wilson, 2007).

The mechanisms underlying the generation of EEG slow
waves, however, remain controversial. Because (1) lesions of thalamic nuclei do not suppress slow waves in anesthetized cats (Steriade et al., 1993b) and (2) UP and DOWN states are recorded in
neocortical slices (Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000; Cossart
et al., 2003) and in an isolated cortical gyrus in vivo during anesthesia (Timofeev et al., 2000), these EEG slow waves are exclusively and consistently viewed as a cortically generated rhythm
(Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000; Timofeev et al., 2000;
Chauvette et al., 2011; Brown et al., 2012). However, (1) increasing thalamic inhibition alters EEG slow waves in anesthetized rats
(Doi et al., 2007) and suppresses whisking-induced cortical UP
states in head-restrained mice (Poulet et al., 2012); (2) UP and
DOWN states, and associated slow waves, can be recorded in
thalamic slices (Hughes et al., 2002, 2004; Blethyn et al., 2006);
and (3) selective thalamic degeneration modifies slow waves of
non-REM sleep in humans (Gemignani et al., 2012). These findings, together with other mechanistic in vitro studies and investigations in anesthetized animals (for review, see Crunelli and
Hughes, 2010), question the current corticocentric view of slow
wave generation and led us to suggest that the full expression of
these EEG waves of natural sleep requires a dynamic interplay of
cortical and thalamic oscillators (Crunelli and Hughes, 2010).
Unfortunately, the resolution of this controversy is still hampered by the lack of any study that has directly and systematically
addressed this issue in unrestrained, naturally waking-sleeping

animals. Moreover, our current mechanistic knowledge of slow
waves of natural sleep continues to be clouded by the speculative
extrapolations of findings obtained in anesthetized conditions.
Using a combination of neuronal ensemble recordings,
thalamus-selective pharmacological inactivation, and optogenetic activation of thalamocortical (TC) neurons in naturally
sleeping or anesthetized rats, here we show, for the first time, that
the thalamus is required for finely tuning the frequency of slow
waves during non-REM sleep and anesthesia. Moreover, we demonstrate that the entrainment of EEG slow waves by selective
thalamic activation is dependent on T-type calcium channels.
Together, these results provide the first conclusive evidence that
cortical and thalamic oscillators are necessary for the full expression of slow waves of non-REM sleep.

Materials and Methods
All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the
United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedure) Act 1986 and local ethics committee guidelines. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and the number of animals used. Experiments were performed on
male adult Wistar rats (260 – 400 g, Harlan Laboratories), maintained on
a normal diet and under a 8:00 A.M. to 8:00 P.M. light-on regimen.

Experiments in anesthetized rats
Surgery. After anesthesia induction with 5% isoflurane, rats received an
intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/
kg). Anesthesia was then maintained with a constant flow of ketamine
(42 mg/kg/h) and xylazine (7 mg/kg/h) delivered via an intraperitoneal
catheter connected to a pump (NewEra NE-300 syringe pump). Body
temperature was maintained at 37°C with a heating pad and rectal probe.
Rats were implanted with gold-plated skull screws (diameter 1 mm,
length 3 mm) for EEG recordings in S1: anteroposterior (AP) ϭ Ϫ2.2
mm, mediolateral (ML) ϭ Ϯ5.5 mm from bregma (Paxinos and Watson,
2007). An additional screw (ground electrode) was placed anterior to the
bregma, and two other screws above the cerebellum were used as reference electrodes for EEG and thalamic recordings.
For measuring the spatial extent of the action of 3,5-dichloro-N-[1-(2,2dimethyl-tetrahydro-pyran-4-ylmethyl)-4-fluoro-piperidin-4-ylmethyl]-

benzamide (TTA-P2), a potent and selective T-type channel antagonist
(Uebele et al., 2009; Dreyfus et al., 2010), or of the sodium channel blocker
TTX in the thalamus (i.e., see experiments illustrated in Fig. 3), a 1 mm hole
was drilled unilaterally above the ventrobasal thalamic nucleus (VB), the
dura was carefully removed, and a 32-channel silicone probe (10 mm length,
0.6 mm width, 1– 4 M⍀) with four shanks (200 ␮m recording point distance,
15 ␮m thickness) (NeuroNexus Technologies) was slowly lowered in the VB
(dorsoventral [DV] ϭ Ϫ4.5 to Ϫ5.5 mm). A second hole in the same hemisphere was used to slowly lower (200 ␮m every 5 min) a microdialysis probe
(CMA 12 Elite, 2 mm dialysis membrane length, 20 kDa cutoff, with a 16°
angle with respect to the vertical axis; see Fig. 3A) to a final position that was
between 0.05 and 1 mm away from the silicone probe. The 16° angle positioning of the dialysis probe was dictated by the space constraints of the
silicone and dialysis probes connecting devices on the animal skull.
For measuring the effect of TTX and TTA-P2 (applied by microdialysis
in the VB) on slow and spindle waves during anesthesia (i.e., see experiments illustrated in Fig. 4), EEG electrodes were implanted as above, and
two microdialysis probes (one in each VB) were slowly lowered fully
vertically until their tips rested 6.5 mm below the skull (i.e., in the most
ventral part of the VB). In some rats, a silicone probe was also inserted
unilaterally in the VB with a 16° angle with respect to the vertical axis.
For measuring the effect of systemic TTA-P2 injection (i.e., see experiments illustrated in Fig. 5), rats were implanted with EEG electrodes and
a unilateral silicone probe in the VB (as described above).
Systemic and microdialysis solutions. For intraperitoneal injection, TTA-P2
was dissolved in saline containing 4% DMSO and the pH adjusted with
potassium hydroxide (1 mM). Control intraperitoneal injections contained
4% DMSO in saline. For reverse microdialysis injection, TTA-P2 was dissolved in aCSF with 4% DMSO. Tetrodotoxin citrate (TTX) was dissolved in
aCSF. Flow rate of the microdialysis injection was set at 1 ␮l/min.
Injections. For the systemic injections, once stable EEG slow waves
were recorded for at least 30 min and high amplitude well isolated units
were present in some of the silicone probe channels, a control period of at
least 40 min was recorded before injecting intraperitoneally either saline/
DMSO or TTA-P2 while continuing recording for at least another 2 h.
For intrathalamic drug application, reverse microdialysis injection of
aCSF was initiated as soon as the microdialysis probes were in position,
and continued for at least 1 h before electrical recordings commenced.
Once stable, high-amplitude, well-isolated units could be recorded from

recorder input via the IP16 event input breakout panel. The digitized data were converted to
Spike2 format (version 5.13, CED). For all further analyses, data were converted to a raw binary format using tools of the freely available
Klusters, Neuroscope, and NDManager software suite (Hazan et al., 2006). EEG data were
low-pass filtered with a windowed sinc filter
at 100 Hz and downsampled to 200 Hz.

Experiments in freely moving rats
Surgery. Rats were anesthetized and implanted
with EEG electrodes, as described above, and an
EMG electrode was positioned in the neck muscle. Two or four microdialysis guide cannulae
(one or two in each VB, respectively) (i.e., see
experiments illustrated in Fig. 6 for two probes in
each VB) were slowly lowered fully vertically so
their tip was just above the VB (DV ϭ Ϫ4.4 mm)
(Paxinos and Watson, 2007). When two guide
cannulae were inserted in each VB, their AP coordinates were as follows: Ϫ2.6 and Ϫ3.8 mm
(Paxinos and Watson, 2007). Both EEG electrodes and guide cannulae were fixed to the skull
with dental acrylic cement. Rats were allowed at
least 7 d to recover from surgery (single housed)
and to habituate to the recording cage (4 h/d). At
the end of the recording sessions, rats were transcardially perfused.
Injections. For the systemic injections, on the
day of the experiment rats were transferred to
the recording cage, connected to the electrical
recording and microdialysis apparatus (as appropriate), and allowed to move freely in their
cage for at least 1 h before any recording commenced. A control period of 1.5 h was then
recorded before an intraperitoneal injection of
either saline or TTA-P2 was made while continuing recording for at least another 2 h. Four
days were allowed between two consecutive
recording days in each rat. For intrathalamic
drug application, 24 h before recording, microdialysis probes were slowly inserted into
the brain to replace the dummy probe in the
guide cannulae. On the day of the experiFigure 2. Detection of slow and spindle waves. A, Representative EEG wavelet power spectrum of slow wave frequency band ments, rats were transferred to the recording

waves (see Fig. 6B) and from 6 to 14 Hz for spindle oscillations (see Fig. 2G,H). The threshold
was defined as 3 times the average energy during a
non-REM sleep period during the control
session. Slow and spindle waves with Ͻ2 and

overlapping oscillations were detected, the wave
with the highest energy was selected.

an equipotent (on burst firing) intra-VB application (compare
with Fig. 3B1), indicating that T-type calcium channels in other
thalamic nuclei and brain regions effectively contribute to the full
expression of EEG slow waves in S1 during anesthesia.
Effect of thalamic inactivation on slow waves during
natural sleep
Because anesthesia does not fully reproduce the spatiotemporal
dynamics of slow waves during non-REM sleep (Chauvette et al.,
2011; Nir et al., 2011; Vyazovskiy et al., 2011), we then applied
TTX and TTA-P2 by reverse microdialysis in the thalamus of
naturally sleeping-waking rats. The same inlet dialysis concentration of TTA-P2 (300 ␮M) and one-probe-per-VB configuration
that was effective during anesthesia had no effect on slow waves of
natural sleep, nor did 1 and 3 mM TTA-P2, most likely because
the volume of tissue where a firing block was achieved with these
higher TTAP-2 concentrations was not much bigger than the
region affected by 300 ␮M (Fig. 3B1,B2,D). We therefore enlarged
the thalamic area affected by microdialysis application by implanting a group of rats with four dialysis probes, so that in each
VB one probe was close to its rostral and one to its caudal end (see
Materials and Methods). In these animals, TTA-P2 (3 mM) in-

and Steriade, 1995, their Fig. 9; Sle´zia et
al., 2011; Ushimaru et al., 2012). The effect of this thalamic modulation will also
be important in determining the slight acceleration of slow waves observed from
sleep Stage 2 to 4 (Crunelli and Hughes,
2010; Brown et al., 2012) because the intrinsic slow wave thalamic oscillator increases its frequency with the progressive
hyperpolarization that accompanies nonREM sleep deepening (Hughes et al.,
2002; Crunelli and Hughes, 2010). Support to the thalamic modulation of EEG
slow waves also comes from data showing
that an acceleration of these waves is accompanied by a phase shift of the TC neuron firing toward the start of an UP state
(Sle´zia et al., 2011).
In the same animals where slow waves
of non-REM sleep were decreased in frequency, the simultaneously recorded
sleep spindles, which are a thalamically
generated rhythm (Morison and Bassett,
1945; Steriade et al., 1985; De Gennaro
and Ferrara, 2003; Astori et al., 2011),
were abolished by inactivation of the same
thalamic region. This demonstrates that,
whereas both cortex and thalamus are required for the full expression of slow
waves and spindles of natural sleep, the
relative contribution of these brain areas
to these oscillations is markedly different,

mice (Lee et al., 2004) suggested a contribution of these channels to ␦ waves (defined as power in the 1– 4 Hz frequency
band) but not to slow waves (defined as
power in the Ͻ1 Hz frequency band). Our
results in anesthetized rats instead indicate that slow waves peaking at ϳ1 Hz are
decreased in number by TTA-P2, leading
to a slowing down in frequency to ϳ0.6
Hz. Although these contradictory data
may be the result of the use of different
species or anesthetics, they may also result
from the different wave classifications. Indeed, it is debatable (Luczak and Bartho´,
2012) whether EEG waves occurring at the
upper end of the ␦ frequency range (2– 4
Hz) in naturally sleeping rats do represent
a separate entity from slow (Ͻ2 Hz) waves
because the underlying UP and DOWN
state firing dynamics of slow waves in the
2– 4 Hz band is similar to that in 0.5–2 Hz
band (Ji and Wilson, 2007, their Fig. 2).
It is not surprising that the vast majority of the total TC neuron firing (i.e., highfrequency bursts plus single action
potentials) depends on T-type calcium
channels (i.e., it is blocked by TTA-P2).
Indeed, although these channels are classically viewed as underlying only highFigure 10. Thalamic entrainment of EEG slow waves requires thalamic T-type calcium channels during anesthesia. A, EEG traces

The low-threshold transient calcium current (IT ) plays a critical role in modulating the firing behavior of thalamic neurons; however, the
role of IT in the integration of afferent information within the thalamus is virtually unknown. We have used two-photon laser scanning
microscopy coupled with whole-cell recordings to examine calcium dynamics in the neurons of the strategically located thalamic reticular
nucleus (TRN). We now report that a single somatic burst discharge evokes large-magnitude calcium responses, via IT , in distal TRN
dendrites. The magnitude of the burst-evoked calcium response was larger than those observed in thalamocortical projection neurons
under the same conditions. We also demonstrate that direct stimulation of distal TRN dendrites, via focal glutamate application and
synaptic activation, can locally activate distal IT , producing a large distal calcium response independent of the soma/proximal dendrites.
These findings strongly suggest that distally located IT may function to amplify afferent inputs. Boosting the magnitude ensures integration at the somatic level by compensating for attenuation that would normally occur attributable to passive cable properties.
Considering the functional architecture of the TRN, elongated nature of their dendrites, and robust dendritic signaling, these distal
dendrites could serve as sites of intense intra-modal/cross-modal integration and/or top-down modulation, leading to focused
thalamocortical communication.

Introduction
The GABAergic thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) plays a central
role in modulating information transfer between thalamus and
neocortex, as well as within the thalamus (Yingling and Skinner,
1976; Crick, 1984; Steriade et al., 1986, 1993; Crabtree et al., 1998;
Crabtree and Isaac, 2002). Centrally located in the thalamocortical circuit, corticothalamic and thalamocortical axons pass
through the TRN, providing the primary sources of synaptic inputs to the nucleus (Jones, 1975; Ohara and Lieberman, 1981; Liu
and Jones, 1999; Guillery and Harting, 2003). In turn, TRN axons
project into the thalamus in which they modify thalamic activities
such as neuronal excitability (Cox et al., 1997; Kim et al., 1997)
and receptive field properties (Lee et al., 1994a,b). Thus, the TRN
is ideally located for modulating thalamocortical communication
via neocortical-driven feedforward or thalamic-driven feedback
inhibition.
Ultimately, the magnitude of inhibition onto the dorsal thalamus depends critically on the voltage state of the TRN neuron.
Like most thalamic neurons, TRN neurons respond to excitatory
input by discharging Na ϩ-dependent action potentials (APs) in
one of two distinct modes: tonic or burst (Llina´s and Jahnsen,
1982; Spreafico et al., 1988; Avanzini et al., 1989; Contreras et al.,

1993). Transitioning between burst and tonic mode depends on
the presence of the low-threshold transient calcium (Ca 2ϩ) current, IT, which is inactivated at relatively depolarized membrane
potentials and deinactivated at relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials (Huguenard and Prince, 1992; Huguenard,
1996). In the deinactivated state, sufficient excitatory input can
activate IT, resulting in a large Ca 2ϩ depolarization known as a
low-threshold spike (LTS), which in turn generates a highfrequency burst discharge of Na ϩ-dependent action potentials.
Despite understanding the role of IT in generating burst output, how this current is distributed across the neuron and more
importantly how it contributes to the integration of afferent information remains speculative. Previous studies have suggested a
dendritic distribution of IT in TRN neurons, but these studies
have been limited because of technical considerations (Destexhe
et al., 1996; Joksovic et al., 2005; Cueni et al., 2008; Kova´cs et al.,
2010). Although this issue has been explored in thalamocortical
relay neurons in which there appears to be a heterogeneous distribution of IT (Munsch et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 1997; Destexhe et
al., 1998; Williams and Stuart, 2000), any comparison between
TRN and thalamocortical neurons is difficult because of their
distinct morphologies and burst properties (Huguenard and
Prince, 1992).
In this study, we used two-photon laser scanning microscopy
(2PLSM) coupled with whole-cell patch recordings to characterize the somatodendritic distribution of IT along individual TRN
dendrites. Here we show that a somatic burst discharge produces
a transient Ca 2ϩ current along the entire length of TRN dendrites, which increases in magnitude at greater distances from the
soma. Importantly, we also show that the direct stimulation of

individual distal dendrites can locally activate distal IT, leading to the amplification of afferent input. These finding have
important implications for understanding how TRN neurons modulate thalamic
transmission, as well as thalamocortical
operations.

Dendritic Ca 2؉ responses are
dependent on firing mode
In many neurons, action potentials initiated in either the axon or soma can backpropagate into the dendritic arbor (Stuart and Sakmann, 1994;
Stuart et al., 1997). In pyramidal neurons of the neocortex and
hippocampus, backpropagating action potentials have been
shown to produce Ca 2ϩ responses along their dendrites (Jaffe et
al., 1992; Markram et al., 1995; Schiller et al., 1995; Magee and
Johnston, 1997). To characterize whether the observed Ca 2ϩ responses were possibly evoked by backpropagating action potentials in TRN neurons, we elicited either a single AP or a tonic
burst of action potentials (four APs at 100 Hz) using brief somatic
current injections (Fig. 4 A). To ensure TRN neurons were not in
burst mode (i.e., deinactivation of IT), the membrane potential of
the soma was adjusted with current to Ϫ60 mV. Under these
conditions, a single and tonic burst of APs produced a small Ca 2ϩ
response at proximal dendritic locations (Fig. 4 B) (single AP,
3.2 Ϯ 2.0% ⌬G/R, n ϭ 6; tonic burst, 6.1 Ϯ 2.0% ⌬G/R, n ϭ 6). At

more distal locations, the Ca 2ϩ responses were difficult to detect
from baseline (single AP, 2.3 Ϯ 1.0% ⌬G/R, n ϭ 5; tonic burst,
2.6 Ϯ 0.9% ⌬G/R, n ϭ 5). Overall, the dendritic Ca 2ϩ responses
evoked by action potential discharge at Ϫ60 mV were significantly smaller than those produced via a burst discharge at Ϫ80
mV (Fig. 4C) ( p Ͻ 0.001, two-way ANOVA). These data strongly
suggest that an underlying LTS must be responsible for the dendritic Ca 2ϩ response.
Dendritic Ca 2؉ responses are mediated by IT
To determine the nature of the dendritic Ca 2ϩ response in TRN
neurons, we initially tested whether the burst-induced response
was dependent on the activation of voltage-gated Na ϩ channels.
Using TTX (0.5 ␮M) to block voltage-gated Na ϩ channels, the
same somatic current injection revealed a transient, Ca 2ϩ-

dependent LTS (Fig. 5A). The LTS in turn
produced a Ca 2ϩ response along the entire length of the dendrite similar to that
generated by a burst discharge ( p ϭ 0.84,
two-way ANOVA). To further confirm
the independence from voltage-gated
Na ϩ channels, distal (Ͼ150 ␮m) responses were measured from the same location before and after TTX application.
Under these conditions, the magnitude of
the response remained the same (Fig. 5B:
117.4 Ϯ 34.0% of control, n ϭ 15D/15N,
p ϭ 0.17, paired t test). These results indicate that, for TRN neurons, the magnitude
of the burst-induced dendritic Ca 2ϩ response is independent of both the backpropagation of somatic action potentials
and dendritic voltage-gated Na ϩ channels.
Focusing on the distal dendrites (Ͼ150
␮m), we next determined which type(s) of
voltage-gated Ca 2ϩ channels underlie the
somatic evoked distal response. While in
the presence of TTX (0.5 ␮M), the addition of the L-type channel blocker nifedipine (1 and 10 ␮M) reduced the LTS
amplitude recorded at the soma (1 ␮M,
ϳ6% reduction; 10 ␮M, ϳ10% reduction)
but did not alter the magnitude of the distal Ca 2ϩ response (Fig. 5C,D: 1.0 ␮M,

response (MIB, 85.5 Ϯ 6.1% reduction,
n ϭ 5D/5N, p Ͻ 0.01, paired t test). To
confirm that the mibefradil block was not
affected by nifedipine, we also tested mibefradil alone and observed a similar reduction (MIB alone, 97.5 Ϯ 1.6%
reduction, n ϭ 4D/4N, p Ͻ 0.001, paired t
test). Mibefradil also blocked the Ca 2ϩ responses at all other dendritic locations
(compared with control condition, p Ͻ
0.001, two-way ANOVA). Similar to nifedipine, the N,P/Q-type Ca 2ϩ channel
blocker ␻-conotoxin-MVIIC (20 – 40 nM)
did not significantly alter the dendritic
Ca 2ϩ response (114 Ϯ 21.2% of control,
n ϭ 5D/5N, p ϭ 0.5, paired t test). Together, these results suggest that the LTS/
burst-evoked Ca 2ϩ response in TRN
dendrites is strongly mediated by the activation of T-type Ca 2ϩ channels.

this response was generated by distally located T-type Ca 2ϩ channels or was simply
the result of the passive invasion of soma/

We next tested the contribution of T-type Ca 2ϩ channels on
the glutamate-evoked Ca 2ϩ response (Fig. 7B). In mibefradil (50
␮M), the amplitude of the glutamate-evoked dendritic Ca 2ϩ responses were significantly reduced regardless of the somatic
membrane potential (at Ϫ80 mV: control, 25.0 Ϯ 6.6% ⌬G/R,

4.8% ⌬G/R, n ϭ 4, p Ͻ 0.01, paired t test). These findings suggest
that distal glutamate application to an individual TRN dendrite is
sufficient to activate local T-type Ca 2ϩ channels. Considering that
mibefradil reduced both the distal Ca 2ϩ response and corresponding somatic depolarization (58 and 12% reduction at Ϫ80 and Ϫ60
mV, respectively), it is likely that IT is amplifying afferent input.
Synaptic activation of distal IT
To probe the functional relevance of distal IT amplification, we
stimulated local excitatory synaptic afferents in place of glutamate application. For these experiments, the stimulating electrode was positioned lateral to the TRN within the internal
capsule so to activate both corticothalamic and thalamocortical
fibers (Golshani et al., 2001; Zhang and Jones, 2004). Using a
single stimulus (40 –300 ␮A, 500 ␮s, 0.1 Hz), burst discharge was
generated in our somatic recording when the neuron was held at
Ϫ80 mV, along with a corresponding large distal Ca 2ϩ response
(Fig. 8 A). The magnitude of the synaptically evoked distal Ca 2ϩ
response did not differ from the response evoked by somatic
current injection (at Ϫ80 mV: synaptic, 27.6 Ϯ 4.0% ⌬G/R; soma
current injection, 23.7 Ϯ 6.9% ⌬G/R, n ϭ 4, p ϭ 0.23, paired t

paired t test). When the soma was depolarized to Ϫ60 mV, the
same stimulus generated one to two action potentials (Fig. 8 B).
Under these conditions, the amplitude of the synaptically evoked
Ca 2ϩ response displayed a considerable degree of variability
(45.9% coefficient of variation, n ϭ 4); however, the large responses generated (21.1 Ϯ 8.3% ⌬G/R, n ϭ 4) were not statistically different from the responses generated by a somatic induced
LTS (23.7 Ϯ 6.9% ⌬G/R, p ϭ 0.48, paired t test). Subsequent bath
application of CPP (20 ␮M) did not alter the amplitude of the
Ca 2ϩ response (with CPP, 17.2 Ϯ 12.7% ⌬G/R, n ϭ 4, p ϭ 0.36,
paired t test), whereas DNQX eliminated the response (1.5 Ϯ
0.5% ⌬G/R, n ϭ 4, p Ͻ 0.02, paired t test).

Discussion
The results of the present study indicate that a somatic burst
discharge or activation of an LTS can evoke a robust Ca 2ϩ response in TRN dendrites mediated by IT. Ca 2ϩ influx was observed along the entire length of the dendrite, with the largest
response typically occurring at more distal locations (Ͼ100 ␮m).
Although all thalamic neurons tested produced a change in dendritic Ca 2ϩ in response to burst discharge, the magnitude within
TRN dendrites was significantly larger than those observed in
thalamocortical relay neurons. In addition, we show that distally
located IT can be activated independently from the soma/proximal dendrites, therefore possibly serving to boost local afferent

inputs onto TRN neurons. The activation of distal IT, by either
focal glutamate application or synaptic activation, required activation of AMPA but not NMDA glutamate receptors. Considering that IT kinetics and amplitude are temperature dependent
(Coulter et al., 1989; Takahashi et al., 1991), performing these
experiments at room temperature have likely altered the typical
physiological response observed at body temperature but may
have also provided a more accurate measurement of the peak
change (Markram et al., 1995). Overall, these findings provide
the first physiological evidence of the somatodendritic distribution of IT in TRN neurons, as well as insight regarding the potential functional role of IT in synaptic integration within reticular
neurons.
Somatodendritic distribution of IT in TRN neurons
It is well documented that activation of IT and the resulting LTS
are responsible for generating a burst discharge of action potentials in TRN and thalamocortical relay neurons (Llina´s and
Jahnsen, 1982; Descheˆnes et al., 1984; Jahnsen and Llina´s, 1984;
Domich et al., 1986; Avanzini et al., 1989; Coulter et al., 1989;
Crunelli et al., 1989; Herna´ndez-Cruz and Pape, 1989; Suzuki
and Rogawski, 1989; Huguenard and Prince, 1992). However,
data regarding the dendritic distribution of IT in the thalamus
have been limited to studies focusing on thalamocortical relay
neurons (Munsch et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 1997; Destexhe et al.,
1998; Williams and Stuart, 2000). For the TRN neuron, any accurate physiological quantification of the distribution of IT has
been lacking. The results of the present study indicate a heterogeneous dendritic distribution of IT in TRN neurons, results that

are consistent with a previous computational study (Destexhe et
al., 1996). Although an accurate quantification of T-type channel
density is difficult to extrapolate, the weak correlation between
Ca 2ϩ response amplitude and dendritic diameter implies an increased density at more distal locations (Fig. 3C). This interpretation corresponds well with a recent anatomical study that
found a higher density of T-type Ca 2ϩ channels in smalldiameter TRN dendrites, likely representing distal dendrites
(Kova´cs et al., 2010).
State-dependent amplification
Our findings also support the general hypothesis that IT may
serve to amplify afferent input as suggested in different neuronal
types (Magee et al., 1995; Gillessen and Alzheimer, 1997; Williams et al., 1997; Urban et al., 1998; Watanabe et al., 1998; Williams and Stuart, 2000; Goldberg et al., 2004). Considering the
voltage dependence of IT, namely being activated from relatively
hyperpolarized potentials, a non-uniform membrane potential
along the somatodendritic axis could have significant influence
on dendritic excitability, synaptic amplification, and ultimately
action potential output. For example, if the somatodendritic axis
is uniformly hyperpolarized, amplified distal input would be uninterrupted and actively propagated toward the soma, ultimately
producing a burst discharge. Conversely, if the soma/proximal
dendrites were depolarized relative to the distal dendrites, distal
signals would still be amplified considering activation of IT, resulting in a larger afferent EPSP at the soma level but not producing a burst discharge. In the later scenario, synapses located
further from the soma would still have an ability to contribute to

Crandall et al. • IT Boosts Distal Dendrites of Reticular Neurons

somatic output given sufficient activation of distal IT. Finally,
different neuromodulators thought to depolarize TRN via actions at distal dendrites (e.g., cholecystokinin, glutamate via
metabotropic receptors) could inactivate IT and thereby dampen
afferent inputs by attenuating the amplification by IT (Cox et al.,
1995; Sohal et al., 1998). Thus, at the dendritic level, IT could
serve to regulate the spatial integrative properties of the TRN
neuron and interactions between distinct dendritic compartments (i.e., proximal/soma and distal).
Given that TRN neurons can have multiple primary dendritic
branches (Scheibel and Scheibel, 1966; Jones, 1975; Lu¨bke, 1993;
Ohara and Havton, 1996), an interesting and potentially important issue is whether or not the voltage state across the somatodendritic axis could differ between individual dendrites of the
same TRN neuron. Such dendritic isolation could promote
highly localized processing and would allow individual branches
to act as independent integrators of different information (Euler
et al., 2002; Ha¨usser and Mel, 2003).
Heterogeneity among TRN neurons
Although this study focused on the functional role of dendritic IT
in TRN neurons capable of burst discharge, there are studies that
have clearly identified a subpopulation of nonbursting TRN neurons (Contreras et al., 1992; Brunton and Charpak, 1997; Lee et
al., 2007). For these neurons, the lack of burst discharge seems to
result from a minimal amount of IT recorded at the soma. However, the inability to induce a somatic burst discharge does not
suggest a complete absences of dendritic IT. It is possible that
nonbursting TRN neurons could represent a subpopulation with
an extreme proximal– distal difference in their distribution of IT.
In theory, maintaining a high density of distal IT would still allow
for the amplification of distal afferent input with the lack of soma/proximal IT preventing the neuron from generating a burst
response. In fact, a more distal distribution of IT in nonbursting
TRN neurons is supported by the fact that in a subset of these
neurons a small LTS could be unmasked when a K ϩ-channel
blocker was applied (Lee et al., 2007). Although such a somatodendritic distribution remains to be tested, the functional consequence of such a distribution may play an important role in the
transfer of modality-specific information as well as thalamocortical operations.
Functional significance of distal IT
Considering the functional architecture of the TRN, elongated
nature of TRN dendrites, and robust responses in distal processes, could distal dendrites serve as sites of intense integration
within and across different modalities? The TRN is situated at the
interface between the thalamus and neocortex and receives collateral innervation from both thalamocortical and corticothalamic projection neurons. As the fibers pass through the TRN,
they assemble in several well defined modality-related sectors
(Jones, 1975; Montero, 1997; Guillery and Harting, 2003). Furthermore, sectors can be subdivided into slabs that receive afferent information from focal areas of the neocortex and dorsal
thalamus or slabs of TRN neurons projecting to specific regions
of the dorsal thalamus (Crabtree, 1999).
Because most TRN neurons possess elongated dendrites
(Scheibel and Scheibel, 1966; Jones, 1975; Lu¨bke, 1993; Ohara
and Havton, 1996), it is likely that neurons near the borders
would have some distal dendrites cross into neighboring sectors
or slabs. Because the majority of afferent inputs onto distal dendrites arise from corticothalamic neurons (Liu et al., 1995), it is
possible that a strong “top-down” modulation of distal TRN den-

J. Neurosci., November 17, 2010 • 30(46):15419 –15429 • 15427

drites would significantly influence the integrative properties of
the TRN by altering the resting voltage-state of the somatodendritic axis. Such top-down modulation could arise from one or a
combination of inputs originating from either the primary sensory neocortex (Montero, 2000) or prefrontal cortex (Zikopoulos
and Barbas, 2006). Ultimately, the degree of top-down influence
onto distal dendrites could dictate the degree in which the TRN
gates “bottom-up” information transfer within and/or across different modalities.
Another potential function of distal dendritic IT is that such
mechanisms could serve to facilitate intra-TRN communication.
Considering that many TRN neurons are coupled by electrical
synapses (Landisman et al., 2002; Long et al., 2004; Landisman
and Connors, 2005) and the electrical signals through these synapses are subjected to severe attenuation and low-pass filtering
(Galarreta and Hestrin, 2001), it is possible that high densities of
distal IT could also serve to amplify dendritic electrical synapses
among TRN neurons and thereby facilitate intra-TRN communication in a state-dependent manner. It is also intriguing to
speculate as to whether IT and electrical synapses could help generate and preserve the endogenous spindle rhythmic activity observed in the isolated TRN in vivo (Steriade et al., 1987).
Furthermore, given the possibility of dendrodendritic synapses
within cat TRN neurons, distal IT could strongly influence such
communication if present in rodents (Descheˆnes et al., 1985). The
fact that we did not observe strong distal Ca 2ϩ responses in relay
neurons and they are not electrically coupled in the relatively mature
animal (Lee et al., 2010) further supports this possibility.
To date, there are limited reports of in vivo electrophysiological recordings of TRN neurons responding to more than one
sensory modality (Sugitani, 1979; Shosaku and Sumitomo,
1983). However, recent studies indicate that TRN activity is subjected to cross-modal modulation (Yu et al., 2009) and may be
affected by various attentional demands (McAlonan et al., 2006,
2008; Yu et al., 2009). In conjunction with our results, we speculate that the contribution of distal dendrites may underlie such
cross-modal actions in a state-dependent manner. Clearly, the
resting state of the dendrites and distribution of IT will have significant influence on thalamocortical operations that requires
future investigation.

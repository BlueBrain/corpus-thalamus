Abstract
All neocortical areas receive inputs from and project back to the thalamus. It is often said that the corticothalamic projections are
organized in a way that reciprocates the spatial distribution of thalamocortical pathways. The present review examines to what extent this
rule of reciprocity is actually supported by the most recent neuroanatomical data, particularly those relating to the central organization of
the vibrissal sensory system in the rat. A critical survey of previous studies is made and new results are presented concerning the
fine-grained organization of corticothalamic projections in this sensory system. Together, prior results and the present set of new data
confirm the existence of both, reciprocal and nonreciprocal patterns of corticothalamic connectivity. This conclusion leads us to propose
that the spatial organization of corticothalamic connections complies with a more fundamental rule, the rule of parity, from which
reciprocity follows as a general, but not obligatory consequence. The rule of parity states that the distribution of corticothalamic
projections across and within the thalamic nuclei is determined by the branching patterns of the different classes of prethalamic afferents.
The anatomical, developmental and physiological consequences of this rule are discussed. The rule of parity suggests that, according to
the behavioral context, both prethalamic and corticothalamic pathways may function in a feedback mode. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. General introduction
This article bears on the organization of corticothalamic
ŽCT. pathways. Our main objective is to examine whether
CT projections that arise from layer 6 of the neocortex
actually reciprocate the thalamocortical projection systems.
The notion of reciprocity was first introduced in neuroanatomy by Diamond et al. w27x to describe the spatial
distribution of the CT projections from the auditory cortical areas in cats. Since the publication of that paper, this
topographic reciprocity has been supported by such a large
number of experimental data that one sometimes considers
that exceptions to this rule just await the verdict of time.
The physiological counterpart of reciprocity is the notion
of feedback, which is currently used to comment on the
functional significance of CT systems. Most researchers in
the field, however, will recognize that in spite of the
numerous experiments initiated along this line of thought,
the physiological role of CT systems still remains an
enigma. Initially, the principle of reciprocity was proposed
as an organization rule of the anatomical links between
thalamic nuclei and cortical areas. The question is whether
this rule is to be considered merely as a useful descriptor
of thalamocortical relationships or as a true operational
principle, whereby the connections established by thalamic
cells in the cortex specify the connectivity patterns of CT
neurons. Are CT cells within a cortical column committed
to make connections with, and only with, the relay cells
that project to the same column? The present review

addresses this issue with reference, in particular, to the rat
vibrissal sensory system.

2. The principle of reciprocity
The principle of reciprocity states that a cortical area
returns axons to the thalamic nucleus from which it receives afferents w27x. As schematized in Fig. 1, if cortical
area A receives input from nucleus X, then, area A projects back to nucleus X. If area A receives inputs from
nuclei X and Y, then area A returns axons to both nuclei X
and Y. Implicitly, the principle of reciprocity rules out the
possibility that cortical area A, for instance, might project
to nucleus Z from which it does not receive afferents.
Soon after the introduction of the axonal transport
techniques in neuroanatomy, it became clear that this
principle also applied to small aggregates of relay cells
within the sensory specific thalamic nuclei and their corresponding projection columns in the cortex. Even in association and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, where cells that
project to a given cortical area are more dispersed or form
separate cellular aggregates, reciprocal patterns of CT
connectivity were found. The question naturally arises as
to whether the principle of reciprocity also holds at a
unitary level: Does any CT cell project back to all those
thalamic cells from which it receives a direct synaptic
input? A precise answer to this question still escapes

present technical capabilities. What recent single-cell labeling studies clearly showed, however, is that each of the CT
cells of a cortical column reciprocates only part of the
connections received by the whole column. As far as it
goes, then, these results do not actually dismiss the principle of reciprocity, but they suggest that the issue is more
complex than what was previously thought.
Over the years, few studies reported data that seriously
challenged the rule of reciprocity. Two cases in point are,
for instance, the apparent lack of feedback projections
from the visual areas 17 and 18 to the central lateral
nucleus in the cat w23x and the existence of bilateral CT
projections Žsee Section 5.5.. Likely because these cases
involve connections with the ‘nonspecific’ part of the
thalamus, they were generally considered more as exceptions than as serious challenges to the rule. In other
studies, however, zones of nonreciprocity were also found
in the sensory specific nuclei such as the medial geniculate
body of the rat w109x and the ventrobasal complex of the
mouse w41x. Although it is always possible to raise methodological issues to limit the significance of these results,
they nevertheless contribute to cast doubt on the idea that
reciprocity is actually the organizational principle of the
connections between the cortex and thalamus.

3. The vibrissal sensory system of the rat
The rodent somatic sensory system is characterized by a
prominent representation of the mystacial vibrissae Žsee
Fig. 2.. On each side of the rat snout, there are five
horizontal rows of whiskers ŽA, B, C, D and E. which
form an orderly array of low-threshold mechanoreceptors.
Each peripheral fiber innervating these mechanoreceptors
responds to only one vibrissa and, centrally, the arrangement of the vibrissal pad is maintained in arrays of cellular
aggregates referred to as barrelettes Žbrainstem., barreloids
Žthalamus. and barrels Žcortex.. These arrays are readily
revealed in sections stained for the mitochondrial enzymes
succinic dehydrogenase or cytochrome oxidase.
Brainstem nuclei that receive vibrissal primary afferents
include the principal trigeminal nucleus ŽPr5. and all subdivisions of the spinal trigeminal complex ŽSp5.. Each of
these Žsub.nuclei contributes axons to the trigeminothalamic tract, but the main stream of ascending fibers arises
from the Pr5 and the interpolar division of the Sp5 ŽSp5I..
Trigeminothalamic fibers innervate the ventral posterome-

dial ŽVPm., posterior group ŽPo. and intralaminar nuclei of
the contralateral thalamus, and each of these nuclei projects to the somatosensory cortical areas.
The rat primary somatosensory cortex ŽS1. comprises
two intercalated cytoarchitectonic divisions. The granular
zone, referred to as the barrel field, is characterized by
dense cellular aggregates in layer 4. The interbarrel septa
and regions surrounding the barrel field exhibit a low cell
density in layer 4 and form together the dysgranular zone.
The caudomedial part of S1, where barrels are especially
prominent, contains the mystacial vibrissae representation.

4. Thalamocortical projections to S1
Since the mid-seventies, axonal transport techniques
have provided a wealth of information about the areal and
laminar distributions of thalamocortical projections w40,45x.
However, our knowledge of these projections at a singlecell level remains limited to the arborization patterns of the
relay cells of a few specific nuclei. In the case of the
association and intralaminar nuclei, this type of information is virtually absent.
Thalamic afferents to area S1 in the rat arise principally
from three thalamic territories: the VPm, the Po and the
intralaminar nuclei Žcentral lateral ŽCL., paracentral ŽPc.
and central medial ŽCeM... The ventral medial nucleus
ŽVM. also provides input to the rat S1 area, but this
projection seems to involve a small number of cells that
project principally to layer 1 w40x. Finally, a small number
of neurons were reported labeled in the ventral lateral
nucleus ŽVL. and the medial division of the medial geniculate body ŽMGm. after injection of fluorescent tracers in
the posteromedial barrel field w76x. The precise topography
of VM, VL and MGm afferents in S1 remains unknown.
4.1. Projections from the Õentral posteromedial nucleus
Axons from the VPm innervate the barrel area where
they form discrete puffs of terminals in the upper part of
layer 6 and in layers 3–4 w3,11,21,44,50,51,64,110x. No
evidence has been yet provided of a VPm projection to the
dysgranular zone of S1. The VPm projection is extremely
precise and establishes a one to one relationship between
thalamic barreloids and cortical barrels w2,11,21,56x. When
extra-barreloid retrograde labeling was reported after the

Fig. 2. Schematic summary of the vibrissal sensory system of the rat. The orderly arrangement of whiskers on the rat snout Žrows A, B, C, D, E and arcs 1,
2, etc.. is represented centrally by arrays of cellular aggregates in the brainstem ŽPR5 and SP5I., thalamus ŽVPm and Po. and somatosensory cortex ŽS1..
The upper left hand frame shows the layout of cortical barrels in an oblique frontal section passing through the second arc of barrels Ždashed line drawn

abbreviations. Part of the schema was modified by Durham and Woolsey w28x.

injection of a single cortical barrel w56x, there is good
reason to believe that the labeling resulted from tracer
uptake by damaged fibers de passage. Indeed, it is not

289

uncommon to observe axonal branches of VPm axons
coursing tangentially toward their target barrel in layer 4
or in the infragranular layers after the solid labeling of

290

ˆ et al.r Brain Research ReÕiews 28 (1998) 286–308

VPm axons with anterograde tracers. In addition, the staining of single VPm fibers either with the Golgi impregnation or with axonal tracers never provided evidence of a
multibarrel innervation by these axons w11,44,63,118x.
4.2. Projections from the posterior group
The medial part of Po ŽPom. gives rise to a second
thalamic projection to S1. This projection arises from cells
scattered throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the nucleus
w30x and innervates both the granular and dysgranular
fields of S1. When the distribution of thalamic afferents to
S1 was examined in tangential sections cut through layer
4, complementarity patterns of VPm and Po projections
were reported, leaving the impression that Po axons terminate exclusively in the dysgranular zone and interbarrel
septa w54x. Although both projections do form spatially
segregated terminal fields in layers 3–4, the other layers
within the barrel columns are not devoid of Pom input.
Yet, the laminar distributions of these two projections
remain largely segregated. While VPm terminals are found
in layers 6 and 3–4 in the barrel area, Pom terminals are
distributed from upper layer 5 to layer 1 of the dysgranular
zone, as well as in layers 5 and 1 of the barrel area w40,64x.
Thus, the dysgranular zone receives input exclusively from
Pom, whereas the barrel columns receives inputs from both
Pom and VPm.
The labeling of single axons issued from different parts
of Po reveals a heterogeneous population of fibers which,
collectively, project across all the somatomotor regions of
the neocortex: S1, the second somatosensory, perirhinal,
insular and motor cortices. The great majority of these
axons Ž) 80%. divide in the white matter at their exit from
the striatum and send branches in different cortical areas.
The laminar distribution of terminal fields varies across
areas, but layers 5a and 1 are usually the most densely
innervated. Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate different projection
patterns of single Pom neurons. It should be noted that
cells labeled at the same injection site in Pom generally
project to the same cortical regions. Thus, the Po nucleus
appears as a collection of discrete neuronal assemblies that
have in common a multiareal projection pattern.
4.3. Projections from the intralaminar nuclei
The intralaminar nuclei have long been considered as
the rostral continuation of a nonspecific arousing system
taking origin in the dorsal mesencephalon. These nuclei
receive indeed a heavy innervation from the cholinergic
groups of the brainstem w39,111x, but their cortical projections, as reported in all studies using modern tract tracing
techniques, are far more specific than what was previously
suspected. Their preferential distribution in the mid-cortical layers of the motor areas and deep layers of the sensory
specific regions dismisses the long standing concept that
intralaminar nuclei give rise to nonspecific thalamocortical

projections that terminate in layer 1 over large expanses of
the neocortex w10,36,40x.
A fair number of intralaminar neurons can be retrogradely labeled when tracers are injected in the deep layers
of the rat S1 area w30,76,118x. These projections arise from
the CL, Pc and CeM nuclei which provide sparse, but
widespread innervation to the deep layers of both the
granular and dysgranular zones w10,40x. The selective arborization of intralaminar axons in layers 5 and 6 of the rat
S1 area was recently confirmed at a single cell level w118x
Žsee Fig. 5.. This study further showed that the intralaminar projection to S1 arises from branching axons whose
main termination sites are the layers 3 and 5 of the frontal
motor areas.

5. Corticothalamic projection systems
In rats, as in all mammals, CT projections arise exclusively from the pyramidal cells of layers 5 and 6. Though
the number of CT cells residing in layer 6 seems particularly high, it has been shown that these are independent of
other layer 6 cells projecting to the claustrum or to other
cortical areas w48,60,117x. Many studies have now reported
that, in sensory specific cortical areas, there is a laminar
segregation of the CT cells that project to different thalamic nuclei w14,15,17,22,34,35,103x. It is not yet known
whether a similar segregation exists in the parasensory and
motor cortical fields. Present evidence clearly indicate,
however, that in the primary sensory areas, the position of
a CT cell within a cortical column relates to its projection
targetŽs. in the thalamus.
5.1. Two types of corticothalamic fibers
On the basis of the intrathalamic distribution of axonal
fields and of the morphology of terminations, two types of
CT fibers were seen to arise from the visual, somatosensory, auditory and motor cortices in mice, rats, cats and
monkeys w14,15,37,42,61,79,86–88x.
The first type, which arises from layer 5 cells, is a
collateral projection issued from long-range axons that
project to the brainstem andror the spinal cord. These
axons do not supply branch to the thalamic reticular
nucleus nor to the sensory-specific thalamus, but to intralaminar and association nuclei in which they form small
clusters of large terminals Ž3–8 mm.. At the ultrastructural
level, terminals form glomerular synapses with the proximal dendrites of relay neurons w42,79,88x. The fine-grained
distribution of layer 5 afferents in the thalamus is not well
known. For the moment, it would be premature to comment on the reciprocity of these connections. Interested
readers should consult the recent review of Sherman and
Guillery w93x and the discussion in Diamond et al. w26x for
additional information.

axonal arbors and injection site on a frontal section. The dashed line indicates the lower limit of layer 4. Note that the projection to S1 arises from branches
of parent axons reaching the frontal motor areas.

The second type of fibers, which are the most numerous, arise from layer 6 cells, supply axon collaterals to the
reticular nucleus and distribute branches bearing arrays of
small drumstick-like terminations Žf 1 mm. across most of
the thalamic nuclei. These CT terminals are presynaptic to
the distal dendrites of thalamic relay cells w46,62,66,96x.
Whether these fibers establish reciprocal patterns of connections is the central issue of the present review.
5.2. Layer 6 corticothalamic cells
The anterograde labeling of small aggregates of CT
cells at different depths in layer 6 of the primary sensory
areas in rat revealed a diversity of terminal arbors in the
thalamus w14,15x. The upper part of layer 6 contains cells
that project exclusively to the sensory specific nuclei Žthe
dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus or the ventrobasal nucleus., where they form barrel-like or rod-like terminal
fields ŽFig. 6A.. Those located deeper in layer 6 generally
exhibit a multinuclear innervation pattern. They innervate
large sectors of the associative andror intralaminar thalamic territories that are affiliated with each of these sensory
modalities Žthe lateral dorsal–lateral posterior nuclei or the
posterior group. and also participate in the formation of
rods or barreloids in the specific nuclei. Similar laminadependent differences in the distribution of CT projections
have been reported in the auditory system of the cat w79x
and in the visual system of the tree shrew w103x. It is not

yet known, however, whether the CT cells in higher order
cortical areas are segregated in layer 6 according to their
thalamic projections.
5.3. Corticothalamic projections from the barrel field
Only two studies have investigated the topographical
relationships between single cortical barrels and thalamic
barreloids. The first, carried out in mice, and the second in
rats, arrived at almost opposite conclusions. Following
Phaseolus Õulgaris-leucoagglutinin ŽPHA-L. and horseradish peroxidase ŽHRP. injections restricted to a single
barrel column in the mouse, Hoogland et al. w41x reported
that CT fibers formed rostrocaudally oriented bands in
VPm, distributing terminals across a series of barreloids
representing together an arc of vibrissae. Retrogradely
labeled cells, however, were found in a unique aggregate
that outlined the shape of a single barreloid. Thus, while
the feedforward thalamocortical pathway implies a one-toone correspondence between thalamic barreloids and cortical barrels, the feedback CT pathway distributes more
extensively in a manner inconsistent with a rule of strict
reciprocity. A very different conclusion was reached by
Land et al. w56x who partly re-examined this issue in the
rat. By using HRP to map connections both anterogradely
and retrogradely, these authors concluded that the thalamocortical and CT connections in the rat vibrissa–barrel
system were highly reciprocal and that species differences

might be at the origin of the discrepancy. Notwithstanding
the fact that HRP is less sensitive than PHA-L to trace
anterograde connections, a close look at the injection sites

reveals that tracer deposits were almost completely restricted to the upper half of layer 6 of a barrel column. We
recently re-examined the topography of the CT projections
of physiologically identified barrel columns in rats by
injecting biotinylated dextran amine ŽBDA. at different
depths in layer 6 and by labeling also the full extent of
layer 6 with a roving micropipette. Following small injections of BDA in the upper part of layer 6 Ždepth s 1500
mm., the terminal labeling in VPM is restricted to a small
territory resembling in dimension and orientation to the
cytochrome oxidase-rich barreloid described by Land et al.
w56x. Fig. 6B shows such a case where all CT axons
converge on the same termination site in VPm. After
slightly bigger injections centered in the upper part of
layer 6, labeled fibers form a compact, sharply defined
plexus in VPm which is accompanied by sparse labeling in
Po and CL nuclei ŽFig. 7A,D.. Serial reconstruction from
horizontal sections reveals the barreloid-shaped terminal

field in VPm. In contrast, when injections of similar size
are made in the lower part of layer 6 Ždepth s 1800 mm., a
barreloid-like terminal field is hardly discernible in VPm.
Instead, CT fibers are seen to invade Po and form a
rostrocaudally oriented band in the dorsal part of VPm
ŽFig. 7B.. Injections that span across the full depth of layer
6 result in a composite terminal field made of the two
preceding projection patterns ŽFig. 7C.. In VPm, the topographical arrangement is such that the whole projection of
a single barrel column forms an orthogonal array of terminations across the field of barreloids.
Using the same material, we examined in detail the
branching pattern of single fibers that coursed at the
periphery of the darkly stained terminal field in VPm.
These axons, which likely arise from the lower half of
layer 6, exhibit a great diversity of branching patterns ŽFig.
8.. Most axons branch to the barreloid corresponding to
their barrel of origin, but they also project to adjacent
regions of VPm, particularly to the dorsal fringe of the
nucleus abuting Po, to Po andror the intralaminar nuclei.
A few also send branches to the ventral lateral nucleus, the
medial division of the medial geniculate body or to VM.

5.4. Corticothalamic projections from the dysgranular zone

6. Summing-up

Sparse anatomical data exist concerning the CT projections issued from the dysgranular zone of S1 in the rat. We
know of only one study that examined in detail the precise
location of CT cells within the barrel field following small
injections of a tracer into the physiologically defined
whisker representation in VPm w21x. This study reported
that retrogradely labeled cell bodies were distributed over
a broader expanse of the cortex than the anterograde
labeling used to define barrel columns. In tangential sections, a fair proportion of CT cells were found in layer 6,
deep to the septal regions. We recently addressed this
question by labeling anterogradely small pools of CT cells
within the broader dysgranular region that surrounds the
barrel field. Injections in layer 6 of the cytochrome oxidase-poor dysgranular zone consistently label fibers that
project to both VPm and Po ŽFig. 9.. In contrast with the
laminar segregation of the CT populations observed in the
barrel columns, CT cells of the dysgranular zone with a
dual thalamic projection are located throughout the full
depth of layer 6.

In the preceding sections, we presented anatomical data
which, albeit restricted in scope, illustrate some inconsistencies between the principle of reciprocity and the actual
organization of CT connections. These data show that, in
the rat somatosensory cortex, Ž1. CT cells in the upper part
of layer 6 of a barrel column establish a one to one
reciprocal relationship with the corresponding thalamic
barreloid; Ž2. CT cells in the lower part of layer 6 not only
reciprocate the other thalamocortical projections received
by the barrel column, but they also innervate in a nonreciprocal manner other barreloids within VPm; Ž3. the dysgranular zone of S1 which does not receive afferents from
VPm, projects to VPm; and Ž4. finally, many cortical areas
project bilaterally in the thalamus although none of these
projections were shown to be matched by bilateral thalamocortical projections. Points Ž2., Ž3. and Ž4. represent
major infringements of the principle of reciprocity, and
most neuroanatomists will admit that these infringements
fall short of a more comprehensive explanation. Here, we
shall propose that the spatial organization of CT connections complies with a more fundamental rule, the rule of
parity, from which reciprocity follows as a general, but not
obligatory consequence.

5.5. Bilateral corticothalamic projections
In a number of species, many studies have now convincingly demonstrated that some cortical areas give rise
to bilateral CT projections. Such projections are not only
present in midline nuclei, where one could suspect an
irregularity of the position of the midline, but also in many
nuclei situated at a distance. In rats, bilateral CT projections have been reported in nuclei of the anterior group
from the cingular, retrosplenial and presubicular areas
w47,78x and in the medial dorsal and submedial nuclei from
the medial and orbitofrontal regions w8,59,85x. The best
documented case concerns the CT projections from the
motor and premotor frontal areas w73x. After injection of
WGA–HRP in the rat motor cortex, terminal labeling was
reported present bilaterally in the ventral lateral, ventral
medial and posterior group nuclei, but more importantly in
the anterior and posterior intralaminar nuclei. These bilateral CT projections arise from branching axons as revealed
by the anterograde labeling of small groups of cells in the
deep layers of the rat motor cortex. Both layer 5 and 6
cells contribute to the contralateral projections with a more
important contribution from the latter. Fig. 10 shows the
reconstruction of the axonal arborizations of two bilaterally projecting neurons.

7. The rule of parity
The rule of parity states that the topographical distribution of CT projections is determined by the branching
patterns of the different classes of prethalamic afferents
Žsee Fig. 11.. Thus, if nucleus X receives a type 1 prethalamic input and projects to area A, then area A returns a type
1-like projection to nucleus X. If nucleus X receives a type
2 prethalamic input and projects to area A, then, area A
returns a type 2-like projection to nucleus X. If nucleus X
receives both type 1 and type 2 prethalamic inputs and
projects to area A, then, area A gives rise to two types of
CT fibers that match both sets of prethalamic inputs. In the
visual and vibrissal somatosensory systems, type 1 and
type 2 afferents may correspond, for instance, to units that
respond either phasically or tonically to sensory stimulation.
Four aspects of this rule need precision. First, the
pairing of CT and prethalamic projections occurs only
between fibers of like functional classes, which implies
that there are categories of CT fibers corresponding to

and B4 ŽB.. Grey areas indicate the location of the densely stained corresponding barreloids in VPm. During the injection, the micropipette was moved up
and down between depths of 1550 and 1900 mm in steps of 10 mm every 10 s; total injection time s 1 h, survival periods three days. Drawings were
made from serial horizontal sections. Abbreviations: AV Žanterior ventral nucleus., fr Žfasciculus retroflexus., VL Žventral lateral nucleus., VLG Žventral

those present in prethalamic pathways. Secondly, pairing
does not mean that the terminal arbors of CT cells form
mirror copies of their prethalamic counterparts. If a relay
cell is contacted by three prethalamic fibers of the same
class whose receptive fields overlap, the projection returned by the cortex to this relay cell may exhibit, at a
single cell level, a spatial distribution corresponding to the
weighted average of the three prethalamic fibers. These
topographical singularities will be masked after the labeling of a large number of like cells in the cortex. Thirdly,
since parity is an operational rule, its implementation
implies ‘hand-shaking’ molecular mechanisms through
which paired connections are established during development. This issue will be discussed in Section 7.4. As a
final specification, it should be mentioned that the rule of
parity applies only to the glutamatergic prethalamic inputs
as there is no reason to believe that GABAergic, aminergic

or cholinergic systems, which exert primarily a modulatory
function, are matched by corresponding CT pathways.
As a necessary consequence, the rule of parity will
generate much reciprocal connections between the thalamus and cortex, but cases of nonreciprocity are not excluded. Such a situation is depicted in the diagram of Fig.
12. Let’s suppose that a sensory system comprises two
types of prethalamic fibers. Type 1 fibers, which contact
exclusively a small pool of relay cells within the sensory
specific nucleus X, and type 2 fibers, which bifurcate to
contact the same pool of relay cells in nucleus X, as well
as other cells in the associative nucleus Y. Relay cells in
nucleus X then establish a point to point relationship with
the primary sensory cortical area A, whereas the relay cells
of nucleus Y project to both cortical areas A and B.
According to the rule of parity, cortical area A will give
rise to two types of CT fibers that will match the arboriza-

tion patterns of both types of prethalamic inputs, while
area B will give rise to a single type of CT fibers that will
project to both thalamic nuclei. Within this scheme, most
of the CT projections will reciprocate the thalamocortical
inputs, except those from area B to nucleus X. This is

actually the type of organization that seems to prevail in
the vibrissal sensory system of the rat. Although relevant
information is still scanty concerning the fine organization
of other CT pathways, available evidence indicates that the
rule of parity might also apply to other sensory systems. In
the auditory system of the cat, Diamond et al. already
noticed that ‘‘ . . . the corticogeniculate fibers vary in size
and terminal pattern in a manner closely related to those
shown by the ascending afferents to these nuclei’’ w27x,
and in the cat visual system, there is an evidence that the
terminal fields of single CT axons in the dorsal geniculate
nucleus are at least as diversified as those of the various
classes of retinal afferents w16,74,98–100x; see Section 7.5.
7.1. Parity in the Õibrissal sensory system of the rat
The correspondence between the arrangement of descending and ascending pathways in the rat somatosensory
thalamus offers a striking illustration of the rule of parity.
Like the CT projections arising from the upper and lower
parts of layer 6, the Pr5 and Sp5I inputs have largely
complementary projection patterns in the thalamus. Both,
upper layer 6 cells in a barrel column and Pr5 neurons in a
brainstem barrelette establish a one-to-one relationship with
their corresponding barreloid in VPm. Likewise, CT cells
of the lower part of layer 6 and SP5I afferents form
mirror-image terminal fields in VPm, Po and intralaminar
nuclei Žcompare Figs. 1 and 2 in Williams et al. w108x with
Fig. 7 of the present review.. Although striking, these
correspondences remain gross for the moment, and the
way these matching topographical patterns are generated at
a single cell level remains to be established.
There exists little information concerning the axonal
arborization of physiologically characterized trigeminothalamic cells. Intra-axonal labeling of a few vibrissa-driven
Pr5 fibers at their entry in the thalamus revealed terminal
arbors that are spatially restricted to the size of a barreloid
w108x. This is likely the case of the thicker axons, because
bulk anterograde labeling studies also revealed a Pr5 projection to Po. No information is presently available concerning the terminal arbor of single Sp5I axons in the rat
thalamus. As a whole, the Sp5I has robust projections to
nonbarreloid thalamic regions, including the Po, the intralaminar nuclei, the dorsal fringe of VPm covering the
barreloids and the interbarreloid septa w29,108x. Intracellu-

lar recordings and electron microscopic studies have clearly
demonstrated, however, that the relay cells within barreloids receive contacts from both the Pr5 and Sp5I afferents w20,105,108x.
Given the fact that many CT cells in the depth of a
barrel column exhibit a multinuclear innervation pattern,
the rule of parity would predict that a fair proportion of
trigeminothalamic cells would innervate both VPm and Po
by means of branching axons. Admittedly, this prediction
goes against the belief that most projections to VPm and
Po arise from separate populations of trigeminal neurons
w19x. It should be reminded, however, that the retrograde
double-labeling technique used to demonstrate these independent populations proved of low reliability in other
circumstances to estimate quantitatively the number of
branching axons. For instance, it was concluded from this
technique that no layer 5 pyramidal cell in the cortex
projected to both the thalamus and the brainstem w18x, but
later studies using anterograde tracers firmly demonstrated
that in fact, all layer 5 cells that project to the thalamus
also project downstream w24,61x. Thus, it is imperative that
the trigeminothalamic projections be re-examined after the
anterograde labeling of small groups of axons to determine
unequivocally the manner these fibers branch in the thalamus.
On the basis of the patterns of CT projections demonstrated in the rat vibrissal sensory system, the rule of parity
predicts the existence of certain CT connections, which
otherwise could be considered as unconventional or aberrant. The schema of Fig. 12 can be used to illustrate the
situation. Let’s suppose that the VPm and intralaminar
nuclei are represented by nuclei X and Y, respectively, and
that boxes A and B represent S1 and the motor areas,
respectively. Anatomical data already showed that the
same intralaminar axons project to both area A ŽS1. and B
Žmotor cortex., and that some CT cells in area A Žcell a.
project back to both the VPm and intralaminar nuclei.
According to the rule of parity, one should find not only
prethalamic axons that branch in both the VPm and intralaminar thalamus, but area B Žmotor area. should also
contain some CT cells Žcell b. that also innervate the VPm
and intralaminar nuclei. At first sight, it seems odd that the
motor areas would return axons to the VPm. This prediction was tested by making large BDA injections in the
deep layers of the rat vibrissal motor area. At a thalamic
level caudal to the ventral lateral nucleus, retrogradely
labeled cell bodies and anterogradely labeled CT axons are
present in the dorsal part of Po, in the intralaminar thalamus and VM ŽFig. 13.. The VPm contains no retrograde
labeling, but in agreement with the rule of parity, some
anterogradely labeled fibers bearing terminations descend
from the overlying plexus in Po and terminate in VPm.
Admittedly, this projection is sparse, but clearly present.
The slenderness of the branches and their departure from
Po suggest that they are collaterals of parent axons that
innervate either Po or the intralaminar thalamus. The pos-

301

sibility that these axonal branches were filled via the axon
collaterals of CT cells in S1 that project to the motor areas
appears remote, because no CT cell in the rat S1 was
shown to make long range corticocortical connections
w117x.
7.2. The number of corticothalamic cells
It is one of the most intriguing feature of the thalamocortical relationships that the number of CT cells exceeds
by far the population of thalamic relay neurons. In the cat
primary visual cortex, their number exceeds the population
of thalamocortical cells found in laminae A and A1 of the
lateral geniculate nucleus by one order of magnitude w53x.
From quantitative studies of other cortical areas w7x, a
similar figure may also apply to the CT populations projecting to corresponding thalamic nuclei. This large number of CT cells constitutes a fact to which the principle of
reciprocity can partly account by postulating much divergence in the projections of thalamocortical systems. Yet,
the disproportion between the two cellular populations
would require a very large number of thalamocortical
branching axons. The rule of parity, however, implies that
the number of CT cells within a given cortical area is
related to the number of prethalamic afferents that influence this area via the thalamus. The branching diagrams of
Fig. 14 illustrate the numerical amplification generated.
The principle of reciprocity would require at most two CT
neurons Žone would suffice!. in cortical area A to reciprocate inputs received from thalamic nuclei X and Y. This
yields a ratio of 2:1 between the number of CT cells in
area A and the number of relay cells in nucleus X. In
comparison, the rule of parity requires a ratio of 4:1
between area A and nucleus X to match the patterns of
prethalamic afferents that influence area A via the thalamic
nuclei X and Y. Thus, within the parity scheme, the
number of CT neurons is commensurate with the degree of
divergence and convergence in both the prethalamic and
thalamocortical pathways.
7.3. Bilateral corticothalamic projections
Although the output of the thalamus is strictly unilateral
Žthe thalamus of one side projects only to the cortex of the
same side., many of its nuclei receive bilateral projections
from the cortex. These exceptions to the principle of
reciprocity can readily be explained by the rule of parity.
All thalamic nuclei that receive bilateral CT projections
are also known to receive a number of bilateral prethalamic inputs. Bilateral prethalamic inputs have been demonstrated in the nuclei of the anterior group from the mammillary bodies w38,94,106x, in submedius nuclei from the
interpolar and caudal divisions of the spinal trigeminal
complex w82,108,113,114x, in the ventral lateral nuclei
from the deep cerebellar nuclei w5,75x, in the ventral
medial nuclei from the deep cerebellar nuclei and the
parabrachial nuclei w5,9,13,75,89x and in the intralaminar
nuclei, from the cerebellum, the spinothalamic tracts, the

deep layers of the superior colliculi and the parabrachial
nuclei w5,77,112x. According to the rule of parity, these
thalamic nuclei, which are innervated by the two cerebral
hemispheres, should receive a prethalamic input from
branching axons. Bilateral branching has already been
demonstrated for axons of the mammillothalamic tract
w38x; in the other systems, this prediction could be easily
tested by means of anterograde labeling.
7.4. DeÕelopmental implications
The formation of specific neuronal connections in the
mammalian central nervous system is thought to rely on
two broad mechanisms: those that require neuronal activity
Žactivity-dependent. and those that do not Žactivity-inde-

pendent.. Growth cones navigate and reach their targets by
using a variety of molecular cues generated by mechanisms that are largely activity-independent w101x. These
mechanisms bring together multiple inputs with appropriate targets to form initial patterns of connections. From
this point on, patterns of activity within these emerging
neural circuits take over as the predominant mechanisms
that drive the refinement and fine-tuning of synaptic connections w49x.
The development of synaptic connections in sensory
systems starts at the periphery and proceeds sequentially at
successive levels of the pathways. Present evidence indicates that the innervation of thalamic nuclei by prethalamic
fibers occurs before that of the cortex by thalamocortical

axons and that of CT projections w57,58,67,92x. In general,
the onset of innervations by thalamocortical fibers also
precedes that by CT axons. The timing in the establishment of synaptic connections thus appears congruent with
the possibility that prethalamic inputs play a role in the
final patterning of CT connections.
While the principle of reciprocity suggests that growth
cones of CT axons use thalamocortical tracts as cues for
pathfinding, a recent study in the visual system has shown
that CT and thalamocortical pathways are physically separate during development w71x, thus, limiting the possibility
of interactions between them. Instead, both pathways may
use some common structures, such as subplate neurons, the
ganglionic eminence and the perireticular nucleus as intermediate targets for axon pathfinding and target selection
w1,33,68,70,72x. Nevertheless, interactions may occur in
the cortex between the two pathways during development.
In the trigeminal system, thalamocortical fibers can induce
barrel-like organization in explants of the visual cortex
grafted to the somatosensory area w90x. Early arriving
thalamocortical fibers may establish direct contact with CT
neurons and induce specific events in such neurons through
activity-dependent or independent mechanisms that would
push CT fibers towards their proper targets. However, such
mechanisms are not applicable for nonreciprocal CT con-

nections unless the blue print of these connections is
specified by prethalamic fibers. Innervation of thalamic
neurons by ascending fibers may trigger or promote the
generation of diffusible factors which act as chemoattractants for incoming CT fibers. Meanwhile, each type of
prethalamic neurons may induce the generation of specific
surface molecules in the postsynaptic thalamic neurons.
Such molecules would interact with specific molecules
present on the growth cones of CT axons, and in doing so,
participate in target recognition and initiate synaptogenesis
thereafter. Thus, the rule of parity implies that the fine-tuning of CT connections relies on the anterograde release of
cue signals by prethalamic axons. The recent demonstrations that neurotrophins are transported anterogradely, released, and can alter the phenotype of target cells in the
central nervous system, represent important results in support of a parity-based determination of CT connections
w4,104x.
7.5. Physiology of corticothalamic pathways
In sensory systems, CT pathways are usually considered
as feedback loops that modulate the responses of thalamic
relay cells to peripheral stimuli. This concept proceeds
from the viewpoint that the thalamus is a relay station;

304

M. Deschenes
ˆ et al.r Brain Research ReÕiews 28 (1998) 286–308

hence, the hypothesis that CT synapses on the distal
dendrites of thalamic relay cells should enhance the transfer of peripheral information towards the cortex w52x. In
agreement with this hypothesis, many studies have reported that the inactivation or removal of the cortex diminished the spontaneous discharges of relay neurons and
their responses to visual or somesthetic stimuli
w6,26,31,32,91,102,107,115,116x. These depressive effects,
however, proved much less dramatic than what could be
anticipated from the elimination of connections of such a
numerical importance. A new perspective was opened
when Sillito et al. reported that the removal of the visual
cortex altered the temporal pattern of sensory-evoked discharges in the lateral geniculate nucleus w95x. In anesthetized cats, they observed that separate pools of relay
cells discharged in synchrony when they were co-stimulated by a long light bar moving across their receptive
fields. As synchrony was lost after the removal of the
cortex, it was concluded that one of the functions of CT
cells is to select and group thalamic neurons into thalamocortical ensembles that signal coherent features of visual
stimuli. Under the assumption that synchronous firing is
the actual mechanism used for binding neuronal ensembles, these results are important because they constitute
strong evidence that the thalamus is not merely a state-dependent gateway, but that it takes an active part in the
central processing of sensory signals. However, the way by
which CT feedback introduces synchrony in the responses
of relay cells remains obscure. Indeed, CT cells have slow
conducting axons that induce slow-rising excitatory postsynaptic potentials in thalamic neurons w25,69x. Therefore,
one does not expect the spike train of CT cells to possess
the temporal structure for imposing synchrony on the
output of thalamic neurons. The CT feedback could at best
increase the excitability of geniculate cells, so permitting
the expression of a temporal code already present in retinal
afferents. A diffuse excitatory system with a widespread
distribution in the geniculate nucleus could possibly exert
the same effect, but, and this is one of the main result of
Sillito et al.’s study, synchrony occurred mainly between
cells of the same type, with respect to both XrY and
onroff-center properties. Conversely, the majority of cells
showing no correlation were mixed pairs. In our mind, this
is a strong point for the rule of parity, as it suggests
specific feedbacks that match the X and Y retinal systems.
7.6. Parity and the notion of feedback
Sensory neurophysiology always proceeds centralwards,
its usual approach consists of the determination on how the
parameters of stimuli encoded by sensory receptors at the
periphery are processed centrally. Because the receptive
fields and responses properties of thalamic neurons closely
resemble those of prethalamic afferents w43,84x, and because thalamic cells exhibit a state-dependent oscillatory
activity w97x, the thalamus was once considered as a gateway, which is shut during sleep and opened during wake-

fulness. Along this centralward direction, the axons returned by the cortex stand as feedback loops whose role
remains undetermined. Theoretical studies proposed that
CT pathways could be involved in functions, such as
selective attention, feature selection and grouping. Still,
these integrating actions are thought to depend on the
configuration of the stimuli that induce matching responses
in CT loops. Corticothalamic pathways do make loops
with the thalamocortical fibers; however, which elements
in a loop form a feedback path is largely a matter of
viewpoint. It is obviously legitimate to consider CT pathways as feedback paths in experimental situations in which
sensory stimuli are delivered to a head-restrained or anesthetized animal, but when animals hunt for stimuli, the
inverse viewpoint likely prevails.
The rule of parity invites to consider CT pathways from
a central viewpoint which is more in line with the psychophysical and behavioral evidence that perception is an
active process intimately linked to the motor activities of
the animal w12,55,65,81x. The pairing of CT and prethalamic innervations postulated by the rule suggests that, in the
absence of peripheral inputs, CT afferents may be capable
of generating prethalamic-like activity patterns in the thalamus. This possibly occurs during REM sleep. During
waking, top–down activation would confer on thalamocortical systems simulation, as well as anticipatory capacities,
two functions that are of prime importance for the survival
of an animal. Amazingly, in these situations, it is the
incoming inputs that would act as a corrective feedback of
what is anticipated. Momentary mismatch would produce
surprise, orienting reaction and exploratory behavior. This
is not to say that all these functions are mainly subserved
by CT pathways, but if these projections comply with the
rule of parity, they would possess at least the wiring
required to support them. Thus, the rule of parity can
accommodate both the down–top and top–down viewpoints, each of which may prevail according to the behavioral context.
As a concluding statement in the now classic book, The
Thalamus, Jones w45x remarked that: ‘‘When we come to
consider the inverse relationship, i.e., the nature of the
information relayed back from the cortex to the thalamus,
we have to confess to almost total ignorance.’’ Thirteen
years later, we must admit that we still have a very vague
idea of what CT pathways do Žsee the review of Sherman
and Guillery w93x.. For the moment, the rule of parity
seems to possess a broader explanatory and predictive
value than the principle of reciprocity. Although future
studies may prove it wrong, it is expected that this concept
will lead to fruitful researches that will help to understand
the role played by these ubiquitous projections.

Appendix A. Methods and technical comments
Original results described in Sections 4 and 5 were
obtained in adult Sprague–Dawley rats by means of the
extracellular and juxtacellular labeling techniques w83x.
Experiments were conducted under ketamine Ž75 mgrkg.
and xylazine Ž5 mgrkg. anesthesia, in accordance with the
federally prescribed and university animal care and use
guidelines. All surgical, histochemical and cell reconstruction methods were identical to those previously described
w15x.
In most experiments, biotinylated dextran amine ŽBDA,
mol.wt.s 10 000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. was
used as a tracer. The tracer Ž2% BDA. was dissolved in
0.5 M potassium acetate and ejected by iontophoresis
Žpositive current pulses of 200–600 nA, 500 ms duration,
half duty cycle for 30 min.. The use of small-sized micropipettes Ž3–6 mm. resulted in the anterograde labeling
of a small number of axons, thus, making possible their
reconstruction from serial sections. Like biocytin, BDA
stains cell processes in a Golgi-like manner, both tracers
seemingly entering into the cells through the small-sized
axonal or dendritic processes severed by the micropipette
Žsee discussion by Pinault w83x.. This is probably the
reason why labeling appears solid and uniform instead of
granular as with tracers that can be actively taken up Že.g.,
lectins or cholera toxin.. After extracellular deposits, the
labeling of fibers de passage is thus unavoidable. This is
not a severe problem with small-sized injections of biocytin because this tracer is readily cleaved by proteolytic
enzymes. The injection sites are almost free of extracellular deposit and stained axons can often be followed to their
cell of origin. At the sites of BDA injection, however, the
extracellular space and neuropil are darkly stained, often
obscuring the origin of the labeled axons. In counterpart,
the superior stability of BDA allows longer survival periods Ž3–4 days, even weeks. and a more extensive axonal
labeling. When the staining of fibers de passage produces
ambiguous results, the problem can be overcome by staining single cells juxtacellularly with BDA. After application
of this staining procedure to thalamic neurons, the axon of
single cells can often be followed to their most distant
termination sites.

Abstract
The present study describes the postnatal expression of calbindin, calretinin and parvalbumin and glutamic acid decarboxylase ŽGAD.
and microtubule-associated protein 2 ŽMAP2. in organotypic monocultures of rat dorsal thalamus compared to the thalamus in vivo.
Cultures were maintained for up to 7 weeks. Cortex-conditioned medium improved the survival of thalamic cultures. MAP2-immunoreactive material was present in somata and dendrites of small and large-sized neurons throughout the cultures. Parvalbumin immunoreactivity
was present in larger multipolar or bitufted neurons along the edge of a culture. These neurons also displayed strong parvalbumin mRNA
and GAD mRNA expression, and GABA immunoreactivity. They likely corresponded to cells of the nucleus reticularis thalami.
Parvalbumin mRNA, but neither parvalbumin protein nor GAD mRNA, was expressed in neurons with large somata within the explant.
They likely represented relay cells. GAD mRNA, but not parvalbumin mRNA, was expressed in small neurons within the explants. Small
neurons also displayed calbindin- and calretinin-immunoreactivity. The small neurons likely represented local circuit neurons. The time
course of expression of the calcium-binding proteins revealed that all were present at birth with the predicted molecular weights. A low,
but constant parvalbumin expression was observed in vitro without the developmental increase seen in vivo, which most likely
represented parvalbumin from afferent sources. In contrast, the explantation transiently downregulated the calretinin and calbindin
expression, but the neurons recovered the expression after 14 and 21 days, respectively. In conclusion, thalamic monocultures older than
three weeks represent a stable neuronal network containing well differentiated neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami, relay cells and
local circuit neurons. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

as a source of afferent input to cortical explants. Considerable efforts have been made to establish thalamocortical
cocultures in order to study laminar specificity of thalamic
afferents and corticofugal projections, the latter arising
mainly from infragranular neurons, and cortical ‘stop-cues’
helping thalamic afferents to target the correct cortical
layers w6,7,12,20,22,26,38,51 x. Further, the role of the thalamic afferents in regulating the neurochemical architecture of the cortex has been analysed w33,34x. Although
these data suggest that basic structural features must have
been conserved in the thalamic explant, the differentiation
processes within the thalamic cultures have not been analysed so far. The present study was undertaken to analyse
the postnatal development of the rat dorsal thalamus in
vitro.

In thalamic monocultures, we investigated the developmental expression of the calcium-binding proteins ŽCaBPs.
parvalbumin, calbindin D-28k and its nervous system specific homologue calretinin, because these proteins are well
known cell type-specific anatomical markers in the rat
thalamus w29x. Functional roles of CaBPs include calcium
buffering w17x; contribution to repolarization of the neuronal membrane w36x and calcium-signalling to intracellular target molecules w19x. CaBPs have a complex
expression pattern in the rat thalamus w42,43x. For example, the retinogeniculate system includes calretinin-positive
fibers and somata in the dorsal and ventral geniculate
nucleus w2x. Also parvalbumin, an abundant muscle protein
w4x, has a high level of expression in the thalamus, e.g., in
the GABAergic neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami
w1,10,13x which project to the ventrolateral thalamus and to
the dorsal geniculate nucleus w47x. Another source of parvalbumin are retinothalamic afferents and thalamic relay
cell axons w28x. We further studied the expression of
glutamic acid decarboxylase ŽGAD-67. on the mRNA
level. It is the synthetic enzyme for the inhibitory transmitter GABA and thus serves as a marker for inhibitory
neurons. In order to demonstrate the differentiation of the
cytoskeleton during development of thalamic neurons, we
evaluated the expression of the neuron-specific marker
MAP2. It binds to microtubules in somata and dendrites
and connects to microfilaments w40x. The developmental
profile of CaBP expression was compared to in vivo using
western blot analysis. An immunocytochemical characterisation in vivo was not performed with regard to the well
characterized architecture of CaBP structures of the dorsal
thalamus w2,3,10,13x.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Preparation of animals
Pigmented Long–Evans rats at different postnatal ŽP.
days ŽP2, P7, P13, P21, P30, P46 and adult. were sacrificed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital
ŽNembutal w , 60 mgrkg body weight, Sanofi Ceva, Hannover, Germany. for subsequent preparation of the in vivo
tissue. Newborn rats ŽP0. were used for preparation of
OTCs, and killed by decapitation.
2.2. Preparation of OTCs
2.2.1. Preparation of OTCs from occipital cortex
The occipital cortex was dissected as described w34x
according to the P0 atlas of Paxinos et al. w37x. The
entorhinal and piriform cortices were cut away, and the
hippocampus was removed. With a coronal cut, the frontal
cortex was removed. The remaining occipital cortex was

coronally sliced with a tissue chopper ŽMcIlwain, Mickle
Industries, Surrey, England. into 350 mm thick slices.
They were transferred immediately into Gey’s Balanced
Salt Solution ŽGBSS; Gibco, Eggenstein, Germany. supplemented with D-glucose ŽMerck, Darmstadt, Germany. to
a final concentration of 0.65% and allowed to recover at
78C for 60 min. Slices with perpendicular orientation were
selected under a stereo microscope and placed as monocultures on defatted, baked coverslips. The tissue was fixed
on the coverslip by 10 ml of chicken plasma ŽCocalico,
Reamstown, PA, USA. and coagulated with 10 ml of
thrombin ŽICN, Meckenheim, Germany. with a final concentration of 25 Urml. The coverslips were placed in
roller tubes ŽNunc, Wiesbaden, Germany., and supplied
with 0.75 ml semiartificial culture medium wŽ2r4 Basal
Medium Eagle, 1r4 Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution, 1r4
inactivated horse serum, 2 mM L-glutamine Žall from
Gibco. and 0.65% D-glucose ŽMerck.x. After 2 days, 10 ml
of a solution containing equal volumes of uridine, cytosine-b-D-arabino-furanoside and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine Ž4.4
mM final concentration; all inhibitors from Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany. were applied for 24 h to retard glial
growth. OTCs were maintained for up to 70 days in vitro
ŽDIV.. The medium was harvested every 2–3 days, and
this cortex-conditioned medium was immediately diluted
with normal medium Ž1:1. and supplemented to the thalamic monocultures.
2.2.2. Preparation of OTCs from the dorsal thalamus
The dorsal thalamus was dissected as described w33x
according to Paxinos ww34x: figures 98–106x into 350 mm
thick frontal slices, and immediately transferred to a culture dish containing GBSS supplemented with antagonists
of excitatory amino acid receptors Ž50 mM 2-amino-5phosphonovaleric acid and 3 mM kynurenic acid; both
from Sigma; 0.65% glucose; 2.5 mM Na 2 HPO4 pH 7.5..
The subsequent procedure was as described above. The
cortex-conditioned medium was fed to thalamic OTCs for
the entire cultivation period for up to 7 weeks.
2.3. Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemistry w34x, OTCs were twice rinsed
in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 3 h.
OTCs were then incubated for 5 min in 1% H 2 O 2 , followed by a treatment of 0.3% Tween 20 and 5% normal
goat serum Žblocking solution. for 3 h Žchemicals from
Sigma.. Primary antibodies were incubated in blocking
solution overnight at 48C. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse-anti-calbindin Ž1r1000 for histochemistry; 1r2000 for protein blots; Sigma.; rabbit-anticalretinin Ž1r3000 for histochemistry; 1r4000 for protein

Ž1r200. was incubated for 2 h, followed by avidin–biotin–horseradish peroxidase complex ŽDakopatts, Hamburg,
Germany.. OTCs were rinsed for 3 = 15 min between
incubation steps. Peroxidase reactivity was developed with
0.02% diaminobenzidine and 0.002% H 2 O 2 in 50 mM
Tris buffer ŽpH 7.4. for 10 min. OTCs were dehydrated,
cleared, and coverslipped with DePeX w ŽServa, Heidelberg, Germany.. All antibodies yielded the widely reported
staining patterns, e.g., in sections of rat cortex. Controls:
Incubations without the primary antibodies remained negative.
2.4. Western blotting procedures
Thalamic tissue extracted from rats at postnatal days
P0–P46 Žin vivo. and from thalamic OTCs Ž8–46 DIV; per
stage we pooled 3–5 OTCs. was homogenized in a buffer
containing protease inhibitor Ž1% 3-wŽ3-cholamidopropyl.dimethylammoniox-propansulfonate ŽCHAPS. ŽMerck.; 75
mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES Ž N-Ž2-Hydroxyethyl. piperazine-N X-2-ethane sulfonic acid. pH 7.8; 0.2 mgrml aprotinin; 1 mM PMSF Žphenylmethylsulfonylfluoride.; 1 mM
EDTA Žethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Žall from Sigma...
The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 = g,
and the pellet was discarded. The protein concentration of
the supernatants was determined according to Bradford w8x.
Per lane, between 50–150 mg protein were lyophilised and
dissolved in SDS-sample buffer waccording to Ref. w25,45x,
respectivelyx and prepared for electrophoresis. For preparation under reducing conditions, 50 mM dithiothreitol was
added to the protein samples.
Electrophoresis was performed with Tris- or Tricinecontaining polyacrylamide gels w25,45x. For detection of
parvalbumin a 7.5–20% gradient gel was used, and linear
16.5% gels were used for calretinin and calbindin. After
the protein transfer w48x for 20 h at 250 mA const. ŽMultiphor chamber, Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany., the nitrocellulose Ž0.45 mm from Schleicher and Schuell, Germany.
was blocked with 0.2% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum
albumin ŽBSA, Sigma. in Tris buffered saline ŽTBS. for 2
h. The primary antibodies for parvalbumin, calbindin and
calretinin Ždilutions given above. were incubated in 0.2%
Tween 20; 0.7% BSA; 0.7 M D-Žq.-glucose, 7% glycerol
in TBS w5x overnight at 48C. After washes, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondaries Žgoat anti-rabbit antibody;
rabbit anti-mouse antibody; dilution: 1r4000; antibodies
from Dakopatts. were used, and phosphatase activity was
detected with 0.45% nitroblue tetrazolium and 0.35% 5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate ŽNBTrBCIP; Roth,
Karlsruhe, Germany. in reaction buffer Ž100 mM NaCl, 50
mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM Tris–HCl pH 9.5..
For comparative analyses of protein amounts on western blots different samples were tested on the same blot.

85

All investigated markers were run at least three times on
sodiumdodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis
ŽSDS-PAGE.. Controls: In order to exclude antibody
crossreactivity against components of cultivated plasma
clots, coagulated chicken plasma was cultivated without
tissue for several days. After harvesting, plasma clots were
prepared for western blotting and served as negative controls Žlanes labeled ‘clot’ in Figs. 2–4..
2.5. Non-radioactiÕe in situ hybridization
OTCs aged 20–25 DIV were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 for 2–3
h, were then rinsed in sterile phosphate buffer and processed for in situ hybridization according to Obst and
Wahle w34x. The GAD-67 cDNA of 2.3 kb length Žgift of
Dr. Kaufman; see Ref. w33x. was cloned into pBS, and
linearized with BamH1 for antisense transcription starting
with the T7 promoter. The parvalbumin cDNA of 0.24 kb
length Žgift of Dr. Berchthold; see Ref. w46x. was cloned in
pGEM3, and linearized with HindIII for antisense transcription from the T7 promoter. The cRNAs w4x were
transcribed in the presence of biotin-UTP ŽGAD cRNA.

probes were mixed at empirically determined optimal dilutions. After prehybridizing the OTCs, probes were applied
for 16 h at 558C. After stringent washes ww34x; 2 = SSC,
2 = SSCr50% formamide, 0.1 = SSCr50% formamide,
0.1 = SSC; all at 558C for 20 min each washx, unspecific

and mouse-anti-biotin antibody Ž1r300; Sigma. in TBS
with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 12 h at 88C. After washes in
TBS, OTCs were incubated in a biotinylated goat-antimouse antibody Ž1r300 in TBS with 1% BSA, 2% normal
goat serum, 0.01% Triton X-100, Dakopatts. for 5 h at
room temperature. Thereafter, the alkaline phosphatase
reaction product was developed with BCIPrNBT as described ŽObst and Wahle w34x. under microscopic control.
Then, OTCs were rinsed in TBS and incubated in Texas
Red-conjugated avidin Ž1r100 in TBS with 1% BSA,
Serva. for 1 h at room temperature. After thorough rinses
in TBS, cultures were mounted, coverslipped with immunofluore ŽICN., and analyzed with standard rhodamine
filters and brightfield on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope.
Photomicrographs were taken with AGFA-Pan APX 100
film, and 400 ASA films for the fluorescence.
Controls: Both probes labeled distinct sets of neurons
when analysed separately Žon OTCs and on sections of
adult rat thalamus; not shown.. Hybridizations with the
sense cRNAs remained negative. Omitting the labeled
cRNA probes from the reaction yielded negative results.
The secondaries alone gave no detectable signals.

3. Results
3.1. Histological features of thalamic OTCs
During the first 10 DIV, thalamic OTCs flattened comparatively more than OTCs of cortex. From the third week
onwards, fields of differentiated neuronal somata were
present, and in many cases the cell-dense medial habenular
nucleus stood out on the former dorsomedial corner of the
explant with visual thalamus in the opposite corner ŽFig.

1A.. At that stage, the cells had settled into a fairly
homogenous layer, which was generally thinner than cortical cultures of the same age. Usually we observed a
thickness of two-three cell body layers which however
may vary within a culture. Thionin-stained cultures displayed neurons of differentiated appearance and a variety
of shapes. Due to expected dissolution of axon fascicles of
intrathalamic fiber tracts during the first two weeks in
vitro, fields of minor cell density occurred which were
invaded by neurons or glia cells from more intact parts

Fig. 1. Thionin-staining of a dorsal thalamus OTC after 14 DIV. Note the compact medial habenular nucleus ŽMHb. which was used as a landmark for
orientation of the thalamic slice during preparation. The arrows in ŽA. point to regions of dissociated appearance with few cell bodies presumed to
represent regions where axon fascicles had degenerated. ŽB. At higher magnification an ordered cytoarchitecture is displayed by more densely packed
zones, suggestive of remnants of thalamic nuclei. Note the absence of pycnotic nuclei. Scale bar: 250 mm in A; 100 mm in B.

thus giving the impression of a locally dissociated culture.
The fibers of the capsula internaroptic tract also disappeared, and the large neurons from the thalamic reticular
nucleus partly embedded within the fiber tracts either
became compressed into cell strands or islands along the
former lateral edge of the explants or intermingled with
neurons of lateral thalamic nuclei in the process of tissue
flattening. Pycnotic nuclei were frequent during the first
two weeks, but became rare thereafter Žnot shown.. Feeding the cortex-conditioned medium was found to improve
the survival of thalamic OTCs.
3.2. Molecular differentiation of thalamic neuronal cell
classes in Õitro
The following sections describe the developmental expression of CaBPs on protein blots in OTCs in comparison
to those in the thalamus in vivo, and the immunohistochemical staining pattern. Further, the staining patterns for
GABA and the neuronal marker MAP2 is presented, and
finally, data about the localization of GAD mRNA and
parvalbumin mRNA. Our aim was to search for the major
thalamic cell classes in OTCs.
3.2.1. ParÕalbumin protein leÕels and morphology of parÕalbumin neurons
The developmental expression of parvalbumin is shown
in Fig. 2. Parvalbumin displayed the predicted molecular
size of 12 kDa, verified by the binding of the polyclonal
anti-parvalbumin antibody ŽFig. 2A,B; a monoclonal antibody was found to be less sensitive on the blots.. This was
in contrast to the results of Hogan and Berman w18x for
kitten visual cortex who reported two forms of parvalbumin with lower molecular weights compared to muscle
parvalbumin. In the thalamus, as well as in the thalamic
OTCs we only found one form of parvalbumin identical in
size to muscle parvalbumin. In vivo, parvalbumin levels
were low during the first two weeks, increased massively
until P21 and slightly declined thereafter ŽFig. 2A.. Thalamic OTCs displayed a lower level of parvalbumin expression over time in vitro ŽFig. 2B. which was comparable to
the level observed during the second postnatal week in
vivo. The increase seen at P21 and P30 in vivo was not
observed at 22 and 30 DIV in vitro. Immunohistochemistry
revealed the cellular correlate for parvalbumin expression.
Parvalbumin-positive neurons mainly occurred along the
lateral edge of the cultures and had large somata and a
strong parvalbumin expression up into dendrites and axonal processes ŽFig. 2C.. The dendritic organization was
multipolar to bitufted and resembled the recently described
w35x neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus.
3.2.2. Calbindin and calretinin expression and cellular
morphology
Fig. 3 shows the calbindin expression during postnatal
development. A band of about 28 kDa molecular weight
was evident. In vivo, the amount of calbindin gradually

87

increased from P0 towards a constant level at P13 ŽFig.
3A.. Under in vitro-conditions the calbindin expression
transiently declined after explantation and reincreased until
21 DIV to reach a steady state level thereafter ŽFig. 3B..
The developmental upregulation was thus delayed in OTCs
for about two weeks. Immunohistochemistry ŽFig. 3C.
revealed intensely labeled calbindin-positive neurons with
small cell bodies Žaverage diameter: 15 mm. and mostly
bitufted or bipolar dendritic trees. The distal dendrites
were beaded.
Calretinin was represented by a band of about 30 kDa
was already present at P0 in vivo ŽFig. 4A.. An increase in
expression was observed at P2 and P7, and levels remained
constant thereafter. In vitro, the calretinin expression disappeared almost completely following explantation ŽFig.
4B.. The expression recovered during the second week in
vitro and reached a level similar to that found in vivo.
After a slight decrease at 30 DIV calretinin expression
went into a steady state level. Size and shape of
calretinin-positive cells ŽFig. 4C. were similar to those of
calbindin-positive neurons. Multipolar, bitufted and bipolar
shapes were observed possessing fine dendrites of beaded
appearance.
In summary, the calcium-binding proteins calbindin and
calretinin had expression levels in long-term OTCs comparable to the in vivo-situation. Although the expression was
transiently reduced following explantation, both markers
recovered within two weeks. The expression of parvalbumin however, showed no transient reduction, but did not
reach the adult levels found in vivo.
3.2.3. Expression of MAP2 and GABA
MAP2 is a neuron-specific microtubule-binding protein
which occurs in somata and dendrites. Stained OTCs revealed well differentiated neurons with large somata ŽFig.
5A,B, arrows. intermingled with many medium sized and
small neurons. The labeled neurites formed a highly interconnected network. MAP2 is known to be present in axons
during an early stage of neural differentiation. Although
we cannot exclude the presence of labeled axons, we
assume that a majority of neurites actually represents
dendrites, mostly the fine beaded dendrites of local circuit
neurons.
GABA is the major inhibitory transmitter in the nervous
system. GABA-immunoreactive structures comprised
heavily labeled neurons of large size and multipolar to
bitufted dendritic trees ŽFig. 5C. along the edges of the
culture, and less intensely labeled, smaller neurons within
the explants. A dense network of labeled processes was
present throughout the culture. The processes give rise to
perisomatically arranged boutons which appear to outline
neighboring non-GABAergic neurons ŽFig. 5C..
3.2.4. Identification of interneurons and projection neurons
Having established the general histology and expression
profiles of neuronal markers, OTCs were probed for the

be expressed in small interneurons in some thalamic nuclei

and in neurons of the perigeniculate and thalamic reticular

parvalbumin mRNA expressing neurons were observed
either as small groups or dense accumulations of cells ŽFig.

which were negative for parvalbumin were often intermingled. Only occasionally did a large parvalbumin expressing
cell display GAD mRNA ŽFig. 6C,D.. In contrast, along
the lateral edge of the cultures, we observed zones contain-

ing numerous large, round to fusiform double-labeled cells
expressing both, parvalbumin mRNA and GAD mRNA.
Especially GAD mRNA was heavily expressed, and in situ
reaction product could sometimes be followed into neurites
extending from the labeled somata ŽFig. 6D,E.. In the
border zones, only a few smaller-sized round GAD mRNA
expressing neurons were found which were always negative for parvalbumin ŽFig. 6E.. The GAD mRNA expres-

4. Discussion
The present study provides evidence that the mammalian thalamus can be maintained in organotypic monoculture for several weeks. So far, the isolated thalamus was
cultured as an explant only for about 1 week w27,30x a
period of time that covers basically the initial processes of
recovery and reorganisation following explantation. Generally, the thalamus was maintained as a coculture together
with visual cortex either for about 2 weeks w6,32,39,50x, or
as long-term coculture for up to 3 months w33x. We have
now shown the ability of dorsal thalamic neurons to
survive and differentiate in long-term organotypic monocultures.
Due to the 3D-organization into distinct nuclei that are
separated by afferent and efferent fiber tracts, many neurons and possibly myelinating glia cells in an early stage

of differentiation are traumatised during explantation and
undergo cell death as is indicated by many pyknotic nuclei
during the first two weeks of cultivation. After that period,
the cultures usually acquires a stable state ŽFig. 1A,B. for
up to 7 weeks in the present study and as thalamocortical
cocultures for up to 3 months in a previous study w33x. The
most likely component improving thalamic cell survival is
the cortex-conditioned medium. It improves the histological appearance suggesting a positive effect for neuronal
survival under deafferented and deefferented conditions.
The presence of such factors is most likely responsible for
the long-term survival in the cocultures. Several authors
have postulated that diffusible cortex-derived factors support neurite outgrowth and prevent cell death w11,26,27x
although the factors have not yet been identified. Since an
uptake and transport of survival-promoting agents via thalamocortical axons is not possible in monocultures, the
receptors for these factors must also exist on the neuronal
somata.
The explantation thus influences the thalamus in a more
dramatic way than a layered cortical structure which at
birth is largely perpendicularly organised with regard to

F. Sieg et al.r DeÕelopmental Brain Research 110 (1998) 83–95

apical dendrites of principal cells and the immaturity of
inhibitory cells. In cortex explants, neurons situated in the
damaged surface of the slices die during the first week in
vitro but the remaining cells regenerate, grow dendrites
and survive due to their rich intrinsic axonal connections.
In contrast, the dorsal thalamus is organized into globular
nuclei of mostly projection cells which relay sensory information towards the neocortex w21x. The axons of these
relay cells have already grown towards the cortical target
areas before birth, and they have little connections intrinsic
to the thalamus. The loss of efferent targets, and the loss of
afferent innervation from sensory systems or from the
neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami which are already established at birth, represents an enormous challenge to thalamic neurons. Further, all cut fiber fascicles
degenerate and likely the associated glia cells die as well.
Their death may further disturb adjacent neurons fighting
for survival. Therefore only a fraction of thalamic neurons
survives and thalamic cultures grew much thinner than,
e.g., cortex cultures. Nevertheless, many thalamic neurons
of all types survive and are able to reorganize as revealed
by the thionin and MAP2 staining. This is evident for the
fields of rather dissociated histological appearance where
neurons have settled in areas formerly occupied by fiber
fascicles. The neurons have sprouted a rich network of
dendrites and axons. GABAergic axons and boutons have
grown over the entire culture. In rodents, most of the
inhibition in thalamic nuclei is derived from inhibitory
reticular and perireticular neurons w24,44x which in part
start to mature prenatally w31x. Besides, the geniculate
nuclei possess intrinsic GABAergic cells w14x which are
still immature at birth. The presence of inhibitory neurons
within the explants suggests that the thalamic interneurons
continue to differentiate in vitro, and they innervate thalamic neurons with boutons highly suggestive of synaptic
contacts. These inhibitory connections are assumed to be
organotypic. However, due to a lack of topographical cues
the reticular projection in vitro remains most likely as
diffuse as in early developmental stages in vivo w31x.
Further, we assume that all thalamic neurons in monocultures continue to develop synapses, because synaptogenesis in the thalamus is largely a postnatal process. Newly
forming reorganized synaptic circuits in long-term monocultures likely include aberrant components, which may
compensate for the loss of afferent synapses and efferent
connectivity.
Thalamic neurons in vitro acquire or continue to express a set of functional markers, especially CaBPs, in a
cell type-specific manner. The calbindin and calretininpositive neurons in OTCs resemble multipolar to bipolar
local circuit neurons with small somata described in thalamic nuclei and the thalamic reticular nucleus in vivo
w3,10,13,43x. Calbindin and calretinin are already expressed at birth, and increase continuously during development in vivo. Surprisingly, they decline dramatically in the
explants. This could suggest that the calbindin and calre-

93

tinin expression in thalamic neurons is controlled by afferents. Expression declines upon deafferentation, but lateron
recovers either by cell-autonomous mechanisms or by
developing intrinsic connections which compensate for the
loss of afferents and reactivate calbindin and calretinin
synthesis. Alternatively, calbindin and calretinin expression depend on activity, and activity most likely declines
upon explantation, but recovers during subsequent reorganisation and synaptogenesis in vitro.
The onset of parvalbumin expression in the dorsal
thalamus is also most likely prenatal, because it is evident
by embryonic day 18 in the thalamic reticular nucleus w47x.
On protein blots, parvalbumin was present from the earliest stage analysed onwards. Frassoni et al. w13x described
an increase of parvalbumin expression between P0 and
P21. Our study now shows that this increase occurs during
the third postnatal week in vivo. It could reflect the
maturation of afferent fiber systems. For instance, retinal
ganglion cells express parvalbumin mRNA and the protein
is mostly exported into the retinothalamic and retinotectal
axons w49x. However, this projection contains parvalbumin
already in the new-born. Other thalamic afferents in vivo
may acquire or increase parvalbumin expression, and since
those are lacking in OTCs, the cultures do not display the
parvalbumin increase. Another possible explanation for the
reduced parvalbumin expression in OTC is that the expression depends on activity Žw9x; Wahle, unpublished observations in cortex cultures.. The double-in situ hybridization
has revealed many parvalbumin mRNA expressing neurons, whereas the number of parvalbumin-immunoreactive
cells has always been smaller, and those present have been
mostly situated along the edges of the cultures. These cells
are inhibitory neurons as indicated by the coexpression of
GAD mRNA. In contrast, relay cells contain no detectable
parvalbumin protein in their somata, but contain parvalbumin mRNA. This could indicate that presumed relay cells
transcribe parvalbumin mRNA, but in the absence of sufficient bioelectric activity or in the absence of an appropriate target region do not translate the protein. The latter
possibility suggests a target influence on posttranscriptional processing, and cocultures with cortex will help to
analyse this possibility. In contrast to relay cells, parvalbumin protein and its encoding mRNA is present in presumed cells of the thalamic reticular nucleus where it may
be expressed in a constitutive, activity-independent way.
The findings of the double-in situ hybridization support
our assumption of a survival of three major cell classes in
thalamic monocultures. Firstly, the large parvalbumin
mRNA and GAD mRNA expressing cells most likely
correspond to neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus
which deliver inhibition to the thalamus. The parvalbumin
and GABA immunostaining also identified round to
fusiform large neurons along the borders of the cultures
suggesting that these neurons express the parvalbumin
protein and its encoding mRNA, as they do in vivo
w3,10,46x. Secondly, the presence of small-sized GAD

94

F. Sieg et al.r DeÕelopmental Brain Research 110 (1998) 83–95

mRNA expressing neurons suggest a survival of local
interneurons known, e.g., for the LGN of the rat w14x.
Thirdly, the large parvalbumin mRNA expressing cells
which are often distributed in clusters suggestive of remnants of thalamic nuclei, and which were negative for
GAD mRNA correspond most likely to relay Žprojection.
neurons. The absence of GAD mRNA suggests an excitatory phenotype and rat thalamic relay cells are believed to
contain glutamate w23x. Evidence that thalamocortical relay
cells express parvalbumin was previously presented w16,29x,
and parvalbumin is present in the thalamocortical axons
w1,41x. Generally, our data show that relay cells survive in
monocultures. A sudden death of all relay cells upon
explantation is further unlikely, because relay cells are able
to regenerate the thalamocortical connection in cocultures
during the first two weeks in vitro w7,33,51x.
In summary, our findings indicate a surprisingly high
capacity of thalamic neurons to survive and reorganize in a
culture model. Due to the progredient lack of topographical organisation over age in vitro it is impossible to
identify the original thalamic nuclei, except for neurons of
the thalamic reticular nucleus. However, the three major
thalamic cell classes could be distinguished in the OTCs,
suggesting that the explantation and reorganization do not
induce a loss of selected cell classes or a loss of cell type
specificity in the expression of functional markers.

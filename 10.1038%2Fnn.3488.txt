Cortical neurons in thalamic recipient layers receive excitation from the thalamus and the cortex. The relative contribution of
these two sources of excitation to sensory tuning is poorly understood. We optogenetically silenced the visual cortex of mice to
isolate thalamic excitation onto layer 4 neurons during visual stimulation. Thalamic excitation contributed to a third of the total
excitation and was organized in spatially offset, yet overlapping, ON and OFF receptive fields. This receptive field structure
predicted the orientation tuning of thalamic excitation. Finally, both thalamic and total excitation were similarly tuned to
orientation and direction and had the same temporal phase relationship to the visual stimulus. Our results indicate that tuning of
thalamic excitation is unlikely to be imparted by direction- or orientation-selective thalamic neurons and that a principal role of
cortical circuits is to amplify tuned thalamic excitation.
Synaptic excitation is important for shaping the sensory tuning properties of cortical neurons1–6. When located in thalamic recipient layers, these neurons receive synaptic excitation from two major sources:
thalamic and cortical neurons. The relative contribution of these two
sources to the tuning of cortical neurons is debated.
In the visual system, both thalamic and cortical neurons respond
robustly to visual stimuli consisting of alternating bars of high and low
luminance (gratings) that move across the visual field causing cyclical
changes in luminance at each location in visual space. As a result of
the spatial arrangement of their receptive fields, many neurons spike
preferentially at specific temporal phases of the grating cycle and
are therefore modulated at the temporal frequency of the grating. In
addition to phase modulation, neurons may exhibit sensitivity to the
orientation of the grating, responding with more spikes at certain
orientations than at others.
In their classic feedforward model, Hubel and Wiesel7 proposed
that thalamic excitation of a cortical neuron could be orientation
selective via the convergence of multiple untuned thalamic inputs
with properly aligned spatial receptive fields. There is evidence for
such receptive field arrangements among the population of thalamic
neurons projecting to the same orientation domain of visual cortex
in ferrets8 and cats9. In addition, cortical neurons whose receptive
field structure overlaps with the receptive field structure of individual
thalamic neurons are indeed more likely to receive input from these
neurons as compared with neurons with non-matching receptive
fields10,11. However, the tuning properties of synaptic excitatory currents resulting from the convergence of a set of thalamic inputs onto
individual cortical neurons are still unclear.
Furthermore, the effect of cortical excitation in shaping the total
excitation received by visual cortical neurons is largely unknown.
In mouse visual cortex, layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons with similar orientation preference are more likely to be connected12 and long-range

­intracortical projections in the visual cortex of other species preferentially connect domains sharing similar orientation preference13–15,
suggesting that cortical excitation might contribute to the orientation
tuning of total excitation.
A pivotal study combining intracellular recording in cat visual
cortex with cooling-mediated cortical silencing isolated thalamic
excitation onto cortical neurons and demonstrated its tuning to
orientation16. However, as the receptive field structure of thalamic
excitation, that is, the spatial organization of ON and OFF receptive
fields, was not assessed in these studies, the mechanisms underlying
the observed orientation tuning could not be addressed. Furthermore,
the relationship between thalamic and total excitation could not be
established because synaptic activity recorded without cortical cooling reflected the combined effects of excitation and inhibition.
We used an optogenetic strategy for cortical silencing in which we
photostimulated parvalbumin (PV)-expressing cortical GABAergic
interneurons17 expressing the light-gated cation channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2)18,19. By harnessing the dense and divergent
inhibitory axons of PV-expressing cells, we were able to completely
silence the cortex for prolonged periods of time without affecting the
dynamics of transmitter release from thalamic terminals. Using this
approach, we examined how the ON and OFF receptive field structure
of thalamic excitation onto layer 4 (L4) cortical neurons can account
for its orientation tuning properties. Consistent with this hypothesis,
we found that, in response to drifting gratings, the phase modulation
of thalamic excitation was tuned to orientation and direction and that
the integral of thalamic excitatory current across the stimulus duration was untuned. Finally, we observed that the orientation and direction tuning, as well as the phase of cortical excitation, onto L4 neurons
matched that of their thalamic excitation. Our findings suggest
that the phase and orientation preference of thalamic excitation are
reinforced by cortical excitation and are consistent with the possibility

RESULTS
Isolating thalamic excitation
To isolate the thalamic component of visually evoked synaptic excitation in L4 neurons in vivo, we optogenetically silenced the mouse visual
cortex (Fig. 1a). The cortex was silenced by photostimulation of inhibitory PV-expressing GABAergic cortical interneurons that conditionally expressed the light-sensitive cation channel channelrhodopsin 2
(ChR2). We evaluated the robustness of cortical silencing by recording,
in loose-patch configuration, the spiking responses of individual primary visual cortex (V1) neurons to visual stimuli consisting of drifting
gratings with and without photostimulation of PV-expressing cells on
interleaved trials (Fig. 1b). Illumination of the cortical surface with a
blue (470 nm) LED for 2.6 s completely silenced both the spontaneous
and visual stimulus–evoked spiking of all recorded neurons throughout
the entire illumination period (n = 14 cells, 2 mice; Fig. 1b). Experiments
in which the local field potential (LFP) was simultaneously recorded
with a second electrode while the LED intensity was varied to decrease
cortical activity to different levels revealed a strong correlation between
the reduction in visually evoked firing rate and LFP amplitude (11 cells,
4 mice; Supplementary Fig. 1). Complete cortical silencing reduced
the amplitude of the visually evoked LFP by ~80% (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Thus, the LFP is a reliable indicator of cortical activity, and
we routinely monitored it in subsequent experiments to verify cortical
silencing (Online Methods). These data indicate that complete cortical
silencing can be achieved by photostimulating ChR2-expressing
PV-expressing cells, consistent with previous reports17,20.
We recorded from L4 neurons (average depth = 386 ± 7 µm,
restricted to 300–550 µm, n = 49 cells, 40 mice; Supplementary
Fig. 2) in the whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration and used visual
stimulation to evoke excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) with
and without cortical silencing on interleaved trials. Visual stimuli
consisted of either an 8 × 8 grid of individually flashed black or
white squares (Fig. 1c) or full-field gratings drifting in 12 different

­directions (Fig. 1d). Cortical silencing reduced the total excitatory
postsynaptic charge (Q, the time integral of the EPSC) evoked by the
flashed square of optimal location and luminance (that is, the luminance and location that evoked the largest Q in control conditions)
by 68 ± 3% (control, mean EPSC = −60 ± 9 pA, Q = 15 ± 2 pC; cortical
silencing, mean EPSC = −17 ± 2 pA, Q = 4.4 ± 0.6 pC; n = 18 cells,
16 mice; Fig. 1c) and gratings drifting in the preferred direction (that
is, the direction that evoked the largest Q in control conditions) by
64 ± 2% (control, mean EPSC = −143 ± 10 pA, Q = 239 ± 17 pC;
cortical silencing, mean EPSC = −46 ± 3 pA, Q = 78 ± 4 pC; n = 42
cells, 33 mice; Fig. 1d). Given that, in the absence of cortical activity,
the principal remaining synaptic input to cortical neurons comes from
the thalamus, these results indicate that the thalamic component of
excitation contributes to 32 ± 3% and 36 ± 2% of the total excitation
evoked by flashed squares and drifting grating stimuli, respectively
(Fig. 1c,d). This estimate is likely to be an upper bound, as cortical
silencing under these conditions has been shown to increase the
activity of thalamic relay neurons as a result of the elimination of
the cortico-thalamic feedback loop17 (Supplementary Fig. 3g). In
contrast, the release of GABA (by photostimulated PV-expressing
cells) did not, per se, substantially affect the estimate of the thalamic
component. The decrease in the membrane resistance of the recorded
neuron via the activation of GABAA receptors was only 32 ± 3%
(n = 15 cells, 11 mice), and a decrease in transmitter release via activation of presynaptic GABAB receptors on thalamic terminals could be
ruled out (Supplementary Fig. 4). We refer to the EPSC and Q recorded
during control trials as EPSCTot and QTot, respectively, and to the
EPSC and Q recorded during cortical silencing trials as EPSCThal and
QThal, respectively.

Receptive field structure of thalamic excitation
To determine the receptive field structure of thalamic excitation onto
individual layer 4 cortical neurons, we silenced the cortex while presenting the 8 × 8 grid of flashed black or white squares and recorded
ESPCThal evoked at each grid location. (Fig. 2a). We generated
separate receptive field maps of thalamic excitation for black (OFF)
and white (ON) stimuli using the value of QThal over a 100-ms
window following stimulus onset for each grid location (Fig. 2a).
Individual OFF and ON subfields were defined as spatially continuous
regions of the receptive field map exceeding the background (Online
Methods and Fig. 2b–e).
In 17 of 18 cells, at least one subfield could be identified. Of these
cells, 13 had both a single ON and single OFF subfield, and the
remaining four had a single OFF subfield. We quantified the spatial
properties of the receptive field in those 13 cells (12 mice) that
exhibited both ON and OFF subfields.
The average area of a subfield for EPSCThal was 242 ± 21 deg2 (n = 26
subfields; Fig. 2f). However, the ON and OFF subfields for individual
cells were highly overlapping in space with an average overlap area
of 167 ± 26 deg2 (n = 13 cells; Fig. 2f). To quantify the overlap of
the ON and OFF subfields, we used the overlap index, defined as the
fraction of the smaller subfield that was overlapped by the larger subfield. The average overlap index was 0.79 ± 0.07 (n = 13 cells; Fig. 2f).

Despite the high degree of overlap, many neurons exhibited a spatial
offset between the peaks of the ON and OFF subfields. The average
distance between ON and OFF peaks was 5.1 ± 0.5 degrees (n = 13
cells; Fig. 2g).
To ensure that the separation between the peaks of ON and OFF
subfields that we measured was not a result of noise in the estimate
of peak location, we simulated the probability that a pair of identical
subfields would exhibit a similar degree of peak separation given the
variability of responses measured in pixels outside of the receptive
field (Online Methods). The probability that the measured separation
between the peaks of ON and OFF subfields was less than the separation between identical subfields was below 0.05 for 12 of 13 cells and
below 0.005 for 9 of 13 cells.
We measured the elongation of the subfields by comparing the
width of each subfield along the axis connecting the peaks of the ON
and OFF subfields (ON-OFF axis) with the width along the orthogonal axis (Fig. 2h). The subfield widths along these two axes were
similar (ON-OFF axis width = 10.6 ± 0.7 degrees, orthogonal axis
width = 11.4 ± 0.7degrees; P = 0.3, not statistically significant, n = 26
subfields). The aspect ratio, the width along the orthogonal axis
divided by the width along the ON-OFF axis, was close to 1 (aspect
ratio = 1.15 ± 0.07, n = 26 subfields). Thus the spatial receptive field

Orientation tuning of thalamic excitation
The separation between the peaks of the ON and OFF EPSCThal
subfields suggests that, in response to drifting gratings, EPSCThal
could in principle be orientation tuned without the average firing
rate (averaged over the stimulus duration) of thalamic neurons contributing to EPSCThal itself being orientation tuned. If the drifting
grating is presented at an orientation at which the bars of the grating are perpendicular to the axis connecting the peaks of ON and

at the same temporal frequency of the grating (F1 modulation) and
be maximal when the two thalamic subfields are activated together.
The difference between the peak and the trough of this EPSCThal fluctuation is the F1 amplitude (F1Thal). In contrast, orthogonal gratings
would activate the subfields sequentially at different temporal phases,
producing a smaller F1Thal. In other words, F1Thal should be tuned
to grating orientation.
Furthermore, if the average firing rate of thalamic neurons that
contribute to EPSCThal is not orientation selective, the number of
action potentials generated in these neurons over the entire stimulus
duration should be the same regardless of the orientation of the grating. Thus, the integral of EPSCThal over the stimulus duration, QThal,
should be the same at each orientation, and QThal should therefore be
untuned to grating orientation.
In contrast, if a cortical neuron receives input from a population of
thalamic neurons whose average firing rate is orientation tuned and share
similar orientation preference, then QThal should be tuned to grating orientation. The tuning of F1Thal in this case would depend on the degree to
which the thalamic inputs fire at the same phase of the grating cycle.
Thus, to examine the orientation tuning of thalamic excitation, we
extracted two values from EPSCThal recorded during drifting gratings:
F1Thal and QThal (Fig. 3a). Note that Q is equivalent to the traditionally
used F0, which is the average value of the response across the entire
stimulus duration.
QThal was markedly similar across all grating orientations,
resulting in a flat tuning curve and a low value of the orientation selectivity index (OSI) and direction selectivity index
(DSI; OSI = 0.026 ± 0.003, DSI = 0.083 ± 0.009, n = 42 cells; Fig. 3b–e).
In contrast with QThal, F1 Thal was clearly selective for orientation and direction (OSI F1Thal = 0.23 ± 0.017, significantly different than OSI QThal, P = 5.8 × 10−15; DSI

ON-OFF separation predicts preferred orientation of F1 Thal
If the separation between the peaks of the ON and OFF EPSCThal
subfields is a major determinant of the observed orientation tuning
of F1Thal, then the relative position of the ON and OFF peaks should
predict the preferred orientation of F1Thal. To test this, we obtained
both receptive field maps (Fig. 4a,b) and drifting grating orientation
tuning curves (Fig. 4c,d) of thalamic excitation in the same neuron.
The predicted preferred orientation derived from receptive field
maps (RFPref ) was determined by the angle of the line connecting the
peaks of the ON and OFF subfields (Fig. 4b). The relationship between
RFPref and the actual preferred orientation of F1Thal (GratingPref ) can
be seen by overlaying vectors indicating RFPref and GratingPref on
the polar orientation tuning curve (Fig. 4d,e). RFPref and GratingPref
were markedly similar, differing by less than 30 degrees in seven of
eight cells (mean difference in preferred orientation = 19 ± 7 degrees;
Fig. 4f,g). Thus, the separation of ON and OFF subfields is likely to be
an important determinant of the preferred orientation of F1Thal.
Tuning of non-thalamic excitation charge
Is QTot, the charge recorded in the absence of cortical silencing, also
untuned to orientation and direction, similar to QThal? Comparison
of the tuning curves for QTot and QThal revealed that QTot was in

photostimulation PV-expressing cell, EPSCsub must, in large part,
reflect cortical excitation. QSub (the charge integral of EPSCSub) was
even more orientation and direction selective than QTot (OSI QSub =
0.083 ± 0.009, P = 1.4 × 10−8; DSI QSub = 0.18 ± 0.017, P = 2 × 10−9;
n = 42 cells) and more selective than QThal (OSI, P = 6 × 10−7; DSI,
P = 3.9 × 10−6; n = 42 cells; Fig. 5f–i). Thus, in contrast with QThal,
both QTot and QSub are tuned to orientation and direction.
Similar to EPSCThal, F1 modulation of EPSCSub was evident particularly at certain orientations (Fig. 6a). We quantified the orientation and direction selectivity of the F1 modulation of EPSCSub (F1Sub)
and compared it to the tuning of QSub (Fig. 6b–g). F1Sub was significantly more selective for orientation and direction than QSub (OSI
of F1Sub = 0.24 ± 0.02, P = 1.2 × 10−10; DSI of F1Sub = 0.38 ± 0.04,
P = 4.4 × 10−6; n = 42 cells; Fig. 6d,f). However, F1Sub and QSub were
tuned to the same orientation (mean difference between F1Sub and
QSub preferred orientation = 20 ± 3 degrees, n = 42 cells; Fig. 6e).
Furthermore, F1Sub and QSub were also tuned to similar directions
(Fig. 6g). Thus, F1Sub exhibits orientation and direction selectivity
that is co-tuned with QSub.
Co-tuning of thalamic and non-thalamic excitation
Both F1Thal and F1Sub were orientation selective (Fig. 7a–c). Are
these two sources of excitation tuned to the same or different
orientations? The preferred orientations of F1Thal and F1Sub differed
by only 20 ± 3 degrees on average (n = 42 cells; Fig. 7d) and the OSI
of F1Thal and F1Sub were not significantly different (OSI F1Thal =
0.22 ± 0.015, OSI F1Sub = 0.24 ± 0.02; P = 0.63, n = 42 cells; Fig. 7d).
In addition, F1Thal and F1Sub were also tuned to similar directions
(Fig. 7e), yet the DSI of F1Thal was significantly smaller than the
DSI of F1Sub (DSI F1Thal = 0.23 ± 0.017, DSI F1Sub = 0.37 ± 0.04;
P = 0.03, n = 42 cells; Fig. 7e).
Finally, we determined the phase difference between F1Thal and
F1Sub at the preferred direction of thalamic excitation. We found that
F1Thal and F1Sub were almost in phase (Fig. 7f), with EPSCThal preceding EPSCSub by 30.3 ± 5.5 degrees or 42 ± 8 ms given the temporal
frequency of our stimulus (n = 42 cells; Fig. 7g). Thus, F1Thal and
F1Sub are co-tuned to orientation and have similar temporal phase.
DISCUSSION
We examined the tuning properties of the thalamic and total excitation received by single neurons in L4 of mouse visual cortex using
whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings and optogenetic cortical silencing. Our recordings revealed that thalamic excitation is organized
into spatially offset, yet highly overlapping, ON and OFF receptive
fields. The relative position of the ON and OFF subfields was predictive of the orientation preference of thalamic excitation in response
to drifting gratings. This orientation selectivity was observed in the
F1 modulation of thalamic excitation (F1Thal), but not in the thalamic
excitatory charge (QThal), indicating that it does not arise from the
convergence of thalamic neurons whose firing rates are orientation
selective. Finally, as the thalamic and cortical contributions to total
excitation were tuned to the same orientation and shared similar temporal phase, our data demonstrate a key function of visual cortex in
amplifying tuned thalamic excitation.
We found that the thalamus contributed, on average, approximately
30% of the excitatory charge to a cortical neuron. This is consistent
with previous studies using intracellular recording and cortical
silencing in the cat visual cortex (37%16 and 46%21), yet is less than
what was reported in rat auditory cortex (61%) 6. Our estimation of
the thalamic contribution is likely to be an upper bound as a result
of the facilitation of thalamic responses to visual stimuli following
nature NEUROSCIENCE  VOLUME 16 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2013	

disruption of corticothalamic feedback with cortical silencing17
(Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition, the potential underestimation
of total excitation (recorded without cortical silencing) in case of
improper voltage clamp may further increase our estimate of the
thalamic component. Finally, the two potential sources of underestimation of the thalamic component, leakier postsynaptic membrane during cortical silencing and inhibition of transmitter release
from thalamic afferents, had only a minor role. PV-expressing cell
photostimulation decreased input resistance of the recorded cells by
only 30%; given the perisomatic distribution of PV-expressing cell
synapses, the conductance underlying this decrease in resistance is
likely to be properly voltage clamped. Furthermore, the potential
activation of presynaptic GABAB receptors on thalamic terminals
via GABA release from photostimulated PV-expressing cells did not
affect transmitter release (Supplementary Fig. 4).
We provide the first description, to the best of our knowledge, of the
ON and OFF receptive fields of thalamic excitation onto visual cortical neurons. The ON and OFF subfields of a single cell were highly
overlapping and had little elongation, but exhibited spatially offset
peaks. The average subfield width was 10 degrees, which is similar
to the average width of the center receptive field of a neuron in the
dLGN of the mouse thalamus measured previously (9.8 degrees22
and 11 degrees23). The receptive fields of thalamic excitation that
we observed are smaller than previously reported receptive fields of
total synaptic excitation3. A possible reason for this difference is that
intracortical connections in our study were functionally eliminated
via cortical silencing. If intracortical connections originate in part
from cortical neurons whose receptive field is outside of or larger than
the thalamic receptive field of the recorded neuron then intracortical
connections would contribute to broadening the receptive field size.
We believe that the spatial offset of the ON and OFF subfields forms
the basis for orientation selectivity of thalamic excitation. When the
drifting grating was perpendicular to the axis connecting the ON and
OFF peaks, it simultaneously activated both ON and OFF subfields
once per grating cycle, resulting in strong F1 modulation (Fig. 4h). At
the orthogonal orientation, the ON and OFF peaks will be activated
sequentially at opposite phases of the grating cycle, resulting in weak
F1 modulation (Fig. 4h). We found that F1Thal was indeed well tuned
for orientation, consistent with observations in cat visual cortex16.
In contrast, the excitatory charge over the stimulus period, QThal,
was poorly tuned, consistent with the Hubel and Wiesel feed­forward
model in which the receptive field structure of thalamic inputs,
rather than the tuning of individual thalamic neurons, forms the
basis of orientation selectivity in cortical neurons7. Indeed, if the firing rate of thalamic neurons was tuned for orientation, the resulting
QThal should also be tuned, which is not what we observed. Thalamic
neurons that are tuned to direction and orientation have been
recently described in the mouse thalamus22,24. However, and consistent with our own dLGN recordings (Supplementary Fig. 3), they
constitute a small fraction (11%) of the neurons in mouse dLGN,
which appears to be dominated by cells with poor direction and
orientation selectivity22. Hypothetically, the F1 modulation, but not
the firing rate, of thalamic neurons could be tuned for orientation.
This could lead to the observed F1Thal tuning and concomitant lack
of Qthal tuning. This is, however, unlikely, as the F1 tuning of dLGN
neurons was poor (Supplementary Fig. 3). Furthermore, the few
dLGN neurons with tuned F1 modulation also appeared to exhibit
similar tuning of their firing rates24. Nevertheless, it is possible that
orientation- and/or direction-selective dLGN neurons may contribute to the tuning properties of cortical neurons outside of L4,
the layer that we targeted.

It has been established in several species that the structure of the
spike receptive fields of cortical simple cells also predicts the preferred
orientation of spiking responses4,25. Furthermore, the receptive field
structure of populations of thalamic inputs in cat visual cortex predicts the preferred orientation of the target domain9. Nevertheless,
our results are, to the best of our knowledge, the first to demonstrate
that the close relationship between receptive field structure and preferred orientation previously observed in the spiking output is already
present in thalamic excitation onto single cortical neurons.
It is arguable that cortical silencing may affect orientation and
direction tuning of thalamic neurons via the disruption of corticothalamic feedback. However, our recordings of dLGN units revealed
little change to their tuning properties during cortical silencing
(Supplementary Fig. 3). This is consistent with previous experiments
addressing the effect of cortex on thalamic tuning properties, which
found effects on overall gain and spatial frequency tuning26, but did
not report changes in orientation or direction tuning.
Although some functional properties of visual cortex, such as spike
rate27, surround suppression28 and inhibition29, are influenced by
anesthesia, other properties, such as orientation tuning27, remain
relatively unaffected. Thus, we believe that the mechanisms underlying orientation tuning revealed here in anesthetized mice are likely
to apply under awake conditions.
We isolated the excitatory component that is not of thalamic origin (EPSCSub) by subtracting the thalamic excitation (EPSCThal)
from the total excitation (EPSCTot). Because of the complete silencing of the cortex following photostimulation of PV-expressing cells,
EPSCSub is likely to mainly reflect excitation mediated by cortical
neurons. Furthermore, as a result of our overestimate of thalamic
excitation during cortical silencing (discussed above), EPSC Sub
is likely to be an underestimate of cortical excitation. Could the
observed tuning of EPSCSub simply result from the subtraction of
an overestimated thalamic excitation from EPSCTot? If so, this would
bias the tuning properties of EPSCSub to be actually anti-correlated
with EPSCThal. However, given that EPSCSub and EPSCThal are cotuned, the tuning properties of EPSCSub are unlikely to be a result
of subtraction artifacts. In fact, the subtraction of an overestimated
EPSCThal likely underestimates the degree of co-tuning of thalamic
and cortical excitation.
Although EPSCSub must largely reflect the synaptic excitation contributed by cortical neurons, it may also contain excitatory currents
generated by active dendritic conductances, activated, for example,
by the combination of thalamic and cortical inputs or synchronous
activity. Our use of voltage clamp reduces such effects, but we cannot
rule out the possibility of such amplification.
Our finding that QSub was orientation selective is consistent with
the observation that, in L2/3 of mouse visual cortex, neurons tuned to
the same orientation are more likely to excite each other12. Our data
suggest that such a rule may also apply in L4, although the relatively
large QSub at non-preferred orientations in some cells implies that
the cortical connectivity is not exclusively orientation specific. The
fact that EPSCSub was F1 modulated and that this F1 modulation was
highly orientation selective may further imply specific connectivity
among cortical neurons that are not only tuned to the same orientation, but also share similar temporal phase. New methods for mapping
the synaptic connectivity between functionally characterized neurons
will address this possibility in the future12,30–34.
In conclusion, the fact that F1Sub and F1Thal are tuned to the same
orientation and share the same temporal phase indicates that, in
the cortex, the excitation provided by thalamic inputs is amplified.
Future experiments that selectively silence recurrent excitatory

cortical synapses will help elucidate the effect of cortical amplification on the output of cortical neurons.

Mice. We used male and female transgenic mice heterozygous for Pvalb-cre
(Jackson Labs #008069). Mice were bred by crossing homozygous Pvalb-cre
C57/B6 males with ICR white wild-type females. All offspring had pigmented
eyes. Mice were housed in a vivarium with a reversed light cycle at a maximum
of five mice per cage. We report whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from
40 mice. Loose-patch recordings shown in Figure 1b are from two mice.
Combined loose-patch and LFP recordings shown in Supplementary Figure 1
are from four mice. LFP recordings during pharmacological block of GABAB
receptors shown in Supplementary Figure 4 are from six mice. Thalamic units
shown in Supplementary Figure 3 are from three mice.
Virus injection. Adeno-associated virus for Cre-dependent ChR2 expression
(AAV2/1.CAGGS.flex.ChR2.tdTomato.SV40, Addgene 18917) was obtained from
the University of Pennsylvania Viral Vector Core. Virus was injected into the
right visual cortex of neonatal Pvalb-cre mice between postnatal day 0 and 2 as
previously described17,20. Pups were anesthetized on a cold pad (0 °C). Virus was
loaded into a beveled glass micropipette (tip diameter 20–40 µm) mounted on
a Nanoject II (Drummond) attached to a micromanipulator. Three bolus injections of 23 nl were made at a depth of 300–500 µm at each of three sites along
the medial-lateral axis of V1.
Mouse preparation for in vivo physiology. In vivo physiology experiments were
performed on mice 1–3 months after neonatal virus injection. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 g per kg of body weight urethane and
2–4 mg per kg chlorprothixene. During surgery, this was supplemented by 1%
isoflurane (vol/vol) in O2. Depth of anesthesia was monitored with toe-pinch
response. 3 mg per kg dexamethosone was administered subcutaneously to
reduce brain swelling. A thin layer of silicon oil was applied to the eyes to prevent
drying. The scalp and fascia were removed and a metal headplate was mounted
over the right hemisphere using dental cement mixed with black paint. A 2–3-mm
diameter craniotomy was performed over V1 (centered 2.5 mm lateral to the midline, 1 mm anterior to the lambda suture). In whole-cell recording experiments,
a partial durotomy was performed on the lateral side of the craniotomy using a
hooked 27-gauge needle for insertion of patch pipettes. The dura was otherwise
left intact. A thin layer of 1.5% low melting point agarose dissolved in artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM d-glucose, 10 mM
HEPES, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgSO4, pH 7.4) was applied to the brain surface
to reduce movement. The craniotomy was then kept submerged under a well of
ACSF. Isoflurane was adjusted to 0–0.5% following completion of craniotomy
and/or durotomy surgery. At the end of the recording session, which lasted 4–8 h,
mice were deeply anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and killed by decapitation.
In vivo physiology. Loose-patch recordings were obtained using glass patch
pipettes (3–5-MΩ tip resistance) filled with 50 µM Alexa 488 hydrazide in ACSF.
Recordings were targeted to ChR2-tdTomato–negative neurons in L4 (350–450 µm
below the pia surface) using the shadow-patch technique35 under a two-photon laserscanning microscope (Sutter) coupled to a Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent, Ultra II)
tuned to 900–1,000 nm. Seal resistance of the loose patch was 10–100 MΩ.
Spikes were recorded in current-clamp mode with zero holding current.
Whole-cell recordings were obtained using the blind patch technique36.
Whole-cell patch pipettes (3–5-MΩ tip resistance) were filled with K+-based
internal solution (135 mM potassium gluconate, 8 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES,
4 mM Mg-ATP, 0.3 mM Na-GTP, 0.3 mM EGTA, pH 7.4) and 50 µM Alexa 488
hydrazide. The depth of the recorded neuron was obtained upon termination
of the recording by identifying the soma and/or pipette tip under two-photon
microscopy and measuring the distance to the pial surface. Neurons were voltage clamped at the reversal potential of inhibition (−69 ± 0.8 mV, n = 49) to
record EPSCs. The reversal potential of inhibition was determined by adjusting
the holding potential to minimize the amplitude of the inhibitory postsynaptic
current evoked by photostimulation of PV-expressing cells. Average series resistance across the duration of the recording was 49 ± 3 MΩ (n = 49). In 41 of 49

whole-cell recordings, LFP was concurrently monitored with a patch pipette
(3–5-MΩ tip resistance, 50 µM Alexa 488 hydrazide in ACSF internal solution)
in L2/3 (150–250 µm below the pia) in current-clamp mode.
Visual stimulation. Stimuli were created using Matlab with the Psychophysics
Toolbox37 displayed on a gamma-corrected LCD monitor (Dell, 44 × 27 cm,
60-Hz refresh rate, mean luminance 85 cd m−2). The monitor was positioned
20 cm from the contralateral eye and repositioned such that the receptive field of
the recorded neuron (as assessed by an experimenter-controlled white bar) was
approximately centered. The ipsilateral eye was obscured from the monitor with
a shield made of black tape.
Drifting gratings. Full-field, full-contrast drifting bar gratings with spatial frequency of 0.04 cycles per degree and temporal frequency of 2 Hz were displayed.
Gratings were randomly presented at 12 evenly spaced directions. Stimulus duration was 1.5 or 1.7 s with a 2-s interstimulus interval in which a gray screen of
mean luminance was displayed.
Receptive field mapping. The stimuli used to map receptive fields consisted
of individually presented black (minimum luminance) or white squares (full
luminance) against a gray background of mean luminance. The squares were
5 degrees in width and appeared in 1 of 64 locations of an 8 × 8 square grid covering 40 × 40 degrees. Stimuli were displayed for 100 ms followed by 200 ms of
gray background before the next stimulus. Stimuli were presented in blocks of
5 or 19 with a 3.5-s or 1.5-s inter-block interval, respectively. A gray screen was
presented during the inter-block interval. For each stimulus presentation, the
location and luminance of the square was randomized.
Photostimulation of PV-expressing cells. ChR2-expressing PV-expressing
cells were photostimulated using a 470-nm blue LED (Thorlabs) coupled to the
widefield epifluorescence illumination pathway of the two-photon microscope.
The LED illumination was delivered to the brain via a 20× water-immersion
objective (1.0 NA, Olympus). The field of view of the objective was centered
on the recorded neuron and focused at its depth coordinate. The total power
out of the front of the objective was 1.3 or 2.3 mW. For drifting gratings and the
5-block flashed squares, the LED was turned on 0.64 s before the onset of visual
stimulus and lasted 2.6 s. For the 19-block receptive field stimuli, the LED was
turned on 0.57 s before the onset of visual stimulus and lasted 6.4 s. Thus, the
entire duration of visual stimulation was encompassed by the LED illumination
period. Trials or blocks alternated between visual stimulus alone and LED and
visual stimulus conditions.
To estimate the change in input resistance in the recorded neurons during
photostimulation PV-expressing cell, cells were clamped at 2–4 different potentials (range = −50 to −80 mV) during an LED step lasting 1.8 s. The input
resistance before LED onset was calculated by determining the current at each
potential, fitting a line to the current-voltage relationship and determining the
inverse of the slope of that line. The current before LED onset was quantified
as the bottom fifth percentile of the current amplitude distribution to exclude
spontaneous synaptic activity. Input resistance during the LED step was determined by plotting the average current during the last 1.1 s of LED illumination
against the holding potential, performing a linear fit and determining the inverse
of the slope of that fit.
Data analysis. All analysis was performed using custom-written code in IgorPro
(Wavemetrics). The holding current (baseline; Fig. 3a) in a 540-ms window before
the onset of visual stimulus was subtracted for each trial. This holding current
was computed from the bottom fifth percentile of the distribution of current
values, which should include the periods with the least amount of spontaneous
excitatory activity. This was confirmed by visual inspection. Trials with the same
visual stimulus and LED conditions were then averaged together (3–8 repeats per
cell). Trial-averaged synaptic currents recorded during control conditions without LED illumination were designated EPSCTot and those recorded during LED
illumination were designated EPSCThal. EPSCSub was generated by point-by-point
subtraction of EPSCThal from EPSCTot (EPSCSub = EPSCTot − EPSCThal).
The excitatory charge (Q) was quantified as the time integral of the EPSC
during the visual stimulus period (Fig. 3a). F1 modulation was quantified by
fitting a sinusoidal function with a periodicity matching the temporal frequency

of the drifting grating (2 Hz) to the cycle-averaged response (average of 2–3
grating cycles, grating period = 0.5 s). The results of this fit were used to derive
F1 amplitude and phase values (Fig. 3a).
OSI was calculated as 1 − circular variance38 using

npg

OSI =

( ∑ rk sin(2q k ))2 + ( ∑ rk cos(2q k ))2
∑ rk

where rk is the response to the kth direction given by θk. DSI was calculated as
(Rmax − Rnull)/(Rmax) where Rmax is the response to the stimulus that produced
the maximum response and Rnull is the response to the direction 180 degrees
away from that stimulus. As additional measures of orientation tuning, we also
calculated the depth of modulation by orientation as well as the tuning width
(Supplementary Fig. 5). The results for these measures of tuning are similar to
those obtained by the OSI.
The population tuning curve for a particular parameter (that is, Q or F1) was
constructed by circularly shifting the tuning curves of all cells so that the preferred
direction of a reference parameter occurred at 0 degrees and then averaging the
tuning curves of all cells. The preferred direction was defined as the stimulus
direction that evoked the largest response. The reference parameter could be the
same or different from the parameter being plotted in the tuning curve. In figures
showing population tuning curves of multiple parameters plotted on the same
axis, if the population tuning curves are aligned to their own preferred direction,
they are referred to as self reference. Otherwise, the tuning curves are aligned to
the preferred direction of a common reference parameter stated in the figure.
Preferred orientation was calculated as the vector average of responses39 by
a = ∑ rk cos(2q k ); b = ∑ rk sin(2q k )
Preferred orientation = 0.5 arctan(b / a) if a > 0
Preferred orientation = 180 + 0.5 arctan(b / a) if a < 0
where rk is the response to the kth direction given by θk. Preferred orientation
spanned the range of 0–180 degrees. Differences in preferred orientation were
calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference. If this value was greater
than 90 degrees, then it was adjusted to the complementary angle by subtracting
it from 180. Preferred direction was defined as the stimulus that produced the
maximum response and spanned 0–330 degrees. Difference in preferred direction was calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference. If this value
was greater than 180 degrees, then it was adjusted to the complementary angle
by subtracting it from 360.

value and s.d. of the background pixels were calculated. Then, a 3 × 3 bilinear
interpolation of the raw receptive field map was generated and z scored using
the previously calculated average and s.d. of the background pixels. All pixels
less than +2.5 z scores were set to 0. Contiguous nonzero regions with area
>2 grid locations were designated as subfields. All other regions were set to 0.
The interpolated and thresholded maps of the subfields were used for subsequent
analysis and display in contour plots. Subfield area was calculated by counting
all of the pixels in the subfield. Overlap area was the area of the region of overlap
between ON and OFF subfields. Overlap index was equal to the overlap area as a
fraction of the smaller subfield. The peak location of a subfield was determined
as the center of mass of the set of pixels within 2 z scores of the strongest pixel.
The subfield width along a given axis was defined as the linearly-interpolated
full-width at half maximum of the subfield along that axis (as shown in the profile
plots in Fig. 2c,d). This was calculated for both the axis between the ON and OFF
subfields and the orthogonal axis. RFPref, the preferred orientation predicted from
the receptive field structure, was calculated as the orientation corresponding to
gratings whose stripes are elongated perpendicular to the axis connecting the
peak locations of the ON and OFF subfields. Horizontal gratings correspond to
0 degrees with clockwise rotations being positive (Fig. 4d).
Four neurons exhibited an OFF thalamic subfield, but lacked sufficiently large
ON responses to define an ON subfield according to the aforementioned criteria.
In one case, the OFF thalamic subfield was situated on the edge of the grid used
for receptive field mapping and so the presence or absence of an ON subfield
could not be determined.
Simulation of separation between identical receptive field subfields. To ensure
that the separation between the peaks of ON and OFF subfields that we measured
was not due to noise in the estimate of peak location, we simulated the probability
that a pair of identical subfields would exhibit a similar degree of peak separation given the variability of responses measured in pixels outside of the receptive
field. For each subfield (n = 26 from 13 cells with 1 ON and 1 OFF subfield), the raw
8 × 8 pixel heat map served as the underlying model subfield for our simulations.
A noise value was added to each pixel to generate one simulated subfield. The
noise was drawn from a Gaussian distribution centered at 0 with an s.d. equal to
the s.d. of the responses in the background pixels (as defined in the previous section). The location of the peak of the simulated subfield was determined as stated
in the previous section. The distance between peak locations for 1,000 pairs of
simulated subfields (each starting from the same ‘true’ subfield) was determined.
The probability that the measured ON-OFF separation for a cell was less than the
separation between simulated identical subfields was calculated as the fraction
of simulated distances that was greater than or equal to the measured values.
Because each cell had an ON and an OFF subfield, we generated two probability
values for each cell that used either the ON or the OFF subfield as the model
receptive field. We refer to the larger of the two probability values in the text.

Response to flashed squares. Responses to the same stimulus luminance, location and LED conditions were averaged together (3–10 repeats per cell). The
baseline activity for each average, defined as the average current level in a 30-ms
window following stimulus onset was subtracted from each trace. We chose a
late baseline window to limit the influence of large spontaneous fluctuations that
often occurred during control trials in the absence of cortical silencing. Although
the baseline window occurred after the onset of the stimulus, it did not contain
visually evoked activity, as the latency to response was typically around 40 ms.

Statistical analysis. All error bars are presented as mean ± s.e.m. and statistical significance was determined using two-sided paired t tests unless otherwise stated. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes,
but our sample sizes were similar to those reported in previous publications in
the field3,16,21. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not
formally tested.

Receptive field of thalamic excitation. Raw receptive field maps of thalamic
excitation were obtained from the average response to black (OFF) or white
(ON) squares at each grid location during cortical silencing. The response was
taken as the integrated excitatory charge across a response window starting 40 ms
after stimulus onset and lasting 100 ms. This window allowed us to capture the
response to the onset of the stimulus and avoid potential contamination by offset
responses, which were occasionally observed. The response at each grid location
was converted to a gray value to generate 8 × 8 heat maps of the raw receptive
field. For each ON or OFF receptive field map, a set of background pixels was
selected by eye that was clearly outside of the responsive region. The average

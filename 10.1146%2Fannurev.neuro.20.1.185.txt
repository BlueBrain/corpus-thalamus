ABSTRACT
Thalamocortical activity exhibits two distinct states: (a) synchronized rhythmic activity in the form of delta, spindle, and other slow waves during EEGsynchronized sleep and (b) tonic activity during waking and rapid-eye-movement
sleep. Spindle waves are generated largely through a cyclical interaction between
thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons involving both the intrinsic membrane properties of these cells and their anatomical interconnections. Specific
alterations in the interactions between these cells can result in the generation of
paroxysmal events resembling absence seizures in children. The release of several
different neurotransmitters from the brain stem, hypothalamus, basal forebrain,
and cerebral cortex results in a depolarization of thalamocortical and thalamic
reticular neurons and an enhanced excitability in many cortical pyramidal cells,
thereby suppressing the generation of sleep rhythms and promoting a state that is
conducive to sensory processing and cognition.

INTRODUCTION
Even the first investigator to directly record the electrical activity in the mammalian cerebral cortex noted that the pattern of cortical activity was dependent
upon the state of the animal (Caton 1887). Since this remarkable beginning, the
investigation of the cellular correlates of sleep and arousal in thalamocortical
systems has enjoyed several periods of rapid development. These include the
demonstration of an ascending activating system in the brain stem that is essential for the generation of sleep-wake cycles (Bremer 1938, Moruzzi & Magoun

1949, Jouvet 1962), and the proposal of hypotheses concerning the generation
of sleep-related thalamocortical rhythms (reviewed in Andersen & Andersson
1968, Steriade & Deschˆenes 1984, Steriade et al 1993c). In the past 15 years,
this base of information has been complemented by a dramatic increase in our
knowledge of the mechanisms of the ionic, cellular, and network mechanisms
through which thalamocortical activity is generated during sleep and of how
this activity is disrupted in the transition to the waking state. In this review, we
examine these more recent developments with a specific focus on the thalamus,
a structure that is central to the generation of state-dependent activity in the
forebrain.
During the periods of sleep that exhibit synchronization of the electroencephalogram (EEG-synchronized sleep), a number of rhythms are present.
Two distinct rhythms that are particularly prominent in thalamocortical systems are delta waves and spindle waves (see Steriade & Deschˆenes 1984,
Niedermeyer 1993). Delta waves in the normal adult are 0.5- to 4-Hz oscillations that are largest during deep sleep, while spindle waves appear as 1to 3-s periods of waxing and waning 7- to 14-Hz oscillations that are superimposed upon the other rhythms of the EEG (see Figure 5, below). Researchers
have known for some time that spindle waves are generated in the thalamus
(reviewed in Steriade & Deschˆenes 1984), and these rhythms were the first for
which a specific hypothesis of generation was proposed (Andersen & Andersson
1968).
Extracellular and intracellular recordings from thalamocortical neurons during EEG-synchronized sleep in naturally sleeping animals revealed that these
cells generate repetitive burst discharges that ride on top of a slower depolarizing potential (Figure 1) (Hirsch et al 1983, McCarley et al 1983). The
transition from EEG-synchronized sleep to the waking or REM-sleep states
occurred with the progressive depolarization of thalamocortical cells and the
abolition of the slow depolarizing spike and its associated burst of fast action
potentials (Figure 1B). These alterations in the firing mode of thalamic neurons
are associated with dramatic changes in the neurons’ responsiveness to peripheral stimuli. For example, during EEG-synchronized sleep, there is a marked
diminution of the responsiveness of LGNd thalamic neurons to activation of
their receptive fields (Livingstone & Hubel 1981), presumably owing to the
hyperpolarized state of these neurons, the interrupting effects of spontaneous
thalamocortical rhythms, and the frequency limitations of the burst firing mode
(see McCormick & Feeser 1990, Steriade & McCarley 1990). Over-powerful
inhibition also may affect neuronal responsiveness during EEG-synchronized
sleep; this inhibition is specifically reduced by activation of ascending cholinergic pathways (Ahlsen et al 1984, Francesconi et al 1988, McCormick & Pape
1988, Curr´o Dossi et al 1992b, Pape & McCormick 1995).

THALAMOCORTICAL ACTIVITY

Figure 1 Lateral geniculate relay neurons display two distinct modes of action potential generation
in relation to behavioral state and electroencephalogram (EEG). During periods of slow-wave sleep,
the EEG exhibits synchronous slow waves, and LGNd relay neurons discharge in bursts of action
potentials (A). In contrast, during waking or REM sleep, LGNd neurons fire in the single spike
or tonic mode of action potential generation (A). Intracellular recordings in vivo during these
transitions indicate that they are accomplished by depolarization of the membrane by 10–20 mV
(B). (Part A from McCarley et al 1983. Part B from Hirsch et al 1983.)

These results, coupled with the earlier observations on the importance of
the thalamus in the generation of sleep rhythms, suggest that the investigation
of thalamic neurons and neuronal circuits may be particularly fruitful in the
search to uncover the cellular mechanisms of sleep-wake alterations in the
forebrain.

THALAMIC NEURONS EXHIBIT TWO STATES
OF ACTIVITY
Early intracellular recordings of thalamocortical neurons in vivo revealed an
unusual rebound burst discharge following hyperpolarization; this discharge
could be generated by the intracellular injection of current or by the natural
occurrence of an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (reviewed in Andersen &
Andersson 1968, Deschˆenes et al 1984, Roy et al 1984). In vitro investigations revealed that the rebound potential occurring following hyperpolarization

is generated by activation of a specialized Ca2+ current, known as the lowthreshold, or transient (IT ), Ca2+ current (Jahnsen & Llin´as 1984a,b). Voltageclamp analysis confirmed the presence of a large low-threshold Ca2+ current,
as well as high-threshold Ca2+ currents, in thalamocortical cells (Coulter et al
1989, Crunelli et al 1989, Hernandez-Crus & Pape 1989). These investigations revealed that IT shows both activation and inactivation. Activation occurs
at membrane potentials positive to approximately −65 mV, while inactivation
becomes complete, at steady state, at membrane potentials positive to approximately −65 mV. The kinetics of activation of IT are considerably faster than are
the kinetics of inactivation, similar to the Na+ current underlying the generation
of the more typical fast action potential. Therefore, if the membrane potential
is depolarized from a relatively hyperpolarized membrane potential (negative
to −65 mV), then IT may first activate and then more slowly inactivate, generating a low-threshold Ca2+ spike (Figure 2B). These Ca2+ spikes typically last
on the order of 100–200 ms, and in turn bring the membrane potential positive
to threshold (approximately −55 mV) for the generation of a burst of three to
eight fast action potentials (Figure 2B) (Jahnsen & Llin´as 1984a,b).
Tonic depolarization of the membrane potential positive to approximately
−65 mV results in the inactivation of IT and therefore the suppression of burst
discharges (e.g. Figure 2A). Following the inactivation of IT , phasic depolarizations that bring the membrane potential positive to −55 mV, such as excitatory
postsynaptic potentials, result in the generation of single, or trains of, action
potentials; however, they do not generate high-frequency bursts (Jahnsen &
Llin´as 1984a,b, McCormick & Feeser 1990). Thus, the properties of IT impart two distinct states of action potential generation onto thalamocortical cells:
(a) burst firing upon removal of a hyperpolarization that surpasses −65 mV for a
sufficient period of time and (b) tonic single-spike activity upon depolarization
positive to approximately −55 mV.

Rhythmic Burst Firing and the Interaction
of Two Ionic Currents
During EEG-synchronized sleep, thalamocortical cells generate rhythmic bursts
of action potentials in the frequency range of 0.5–4 Hz, even during the generation of spindle waves, which occur at frequencies of 7–14 Hz (McCarley
1983, Roy et al 1984, Amzica & Steriade 1995a). Intracellular recordings in
slices of cat LGNd maintained in vitro revealed a similar pattern of activity.
Left unperturbed, a subpopulation of thalamocortical neurons generates lowthreshold Ca2+ spikes in a rhythmic manner at a frequency of approximately
0.5–4 Hz (Figure 2) (McCormick & Pape 1990a, Leresche et al 1991, Soltesz
et al 1991). This rhythmic burst firing results from the interaction of the lowthreshold Ca2+ spike and a hyperpolarization-activated cation current known as

Figure 2 Thalamocortical neurons generate two distinct patterns of action potentials via the
interaction of ionic currents. (A) This cat LGNd neuron generated rhythmic burst firing at a rate of
about 2 Hz. Depolarization of the cell to −58 mV with the intracellular injection of current (depol.
current injection) halted the rhythmic activity and switched the neuron to the tonic, or single spike,
mode of action potential generation, owing to the inactivation of IT . Removal of the depolarization
reinstated the oscillatory activity. (B) Expanded trace of oscillatory activity and the proposed
currents that largely mediate it. Activation of the low-threshold calcium current, IT , depolarizes
the membrane toward threshold for a burst of Na+ - and K+ -dependent fast action potentials. The
depolarization deactivates the portion of Ih that was active immediately before the Ca2+ spike.
Repolarization of the membrane due to IT inactivation is followed by a hyperpolarizing overshoot,
which is due to the reduced depolarizing effect of Ih . The hyperpolarization in turn de-inactivates
IT and activates Ih , which depolarizes the membrane toward threshold for another Ca2+ spike.
(C) Expanded trace of single-spike activity. (From McCormick & Pape 1990a.)

the h-current (Ih ). Hyperpolarization of thalamocortical neurons to membrane
potentials negative to approximately −55 mV slowly activates a mixed Na+
and K+ current that depolarizes the neuron back toward the reversal potential
of this current (approximately −35 mV). Consequently, the falling phase of a
low-threshold Ca2+ spike is associated with the activation of Ih , and the activation of Ih results in a slow depolarization. This pacemaker potential again
activates IT and therefore another low-threshold Ca2+ spike.
The precise shape of the low-threshold Ca2+ spike may be controlled by the
activation of a variety of K+ currents that have been characterized in thalamocortical neurons (see Huguenard & McCormick 1992, Soltesz et al 1991,
McCormick & Huguenard 1992). The interaction between the voltage dependence and the kinetics of the low-threshold Ca2+ current and the hyperpolarization-activated cation current result in the intrinsic propensity of thalamocortical
neurons to generate rhythmic oscillations in the frequency range of 0.5–4 Hz
(McCormick & Pape 1990a, McCormick & Huguenard 1992, Curr´o Dossi et al
1992a), which is the frequency range of delta waves. Computational models
of single thalamocortical cells suggest that small shifts in the amplitude or
voltage dependence of either IT or Ih can result in large effects on the ability
of single cells to generate rhythmic low-threshold Ca2+ spikes (McCormick
& Huguenard 1992, Toth & Crunelli 1992, Destexhe et al 1993a,b). These
findings are particularly relevant to the investigation of the mechanisms underlying the cessation of spindle waves and to the neurotransmitter control of
synchronized thalamocortical rhythms (see below).

Thalamic Reticular Neurons also Exhibit Two
States of Activity
Surrounding the thalamus and interposed between the thalamus and the cerebral
cortex is a collection of GABAergic neurons known as the thalamic reticular nucleus (reviewed in Steriade & Deschˆenes 1984, Jones 1985). The perigeniculate
nucleus is considered part of the thalamic reticular nucleus and is connected to
the LGNd. The GABAergic neurons of the thalamic reticular and perigeniculate
nuclei are innervated by axon collaterals of thalamocortical and corticothalamic neurons and give rise to a dense innervation of thalamocortical cells in a
manner that often preserves reciprocal interactions between appropriate points
in the thalamus, thalamic reticular nucleus, and cerebral cortex (see Steriade &
Deschˆenes 1984, Jones 1985, Shosaku et al 1989, Uhlrich et al 1991, Bal et al
1995a,b, Pinault et al 1995a,b).
The GABAergic neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus change their firing
mode in a manner similar to that of thalamocortical cells (Steriade et al 1986).
During periods of EEG-synchronized sleep, thalamic reticular cells generate

rhythmic high-frequency (350–450 Hz) bursts of action potentials, while during waking and REM sleep, these neurons generate sequences of tonic action
potential activity. As in thalamocortical cells, these two activity states result
from the properties of the low-threshold Ca2+ current (Figure 3) (Mulle et al
1986, Avanzini et al 1989, Huguenard & Prince 1992, Bal & McCormick 1993,
Contreras et al 1993). However, these low-threshold Ca2+ spikes are distinct
from those of thalamocortical neurons in an important way: Their voltage dependence is shifted to more positive membrane potentials (Huguenard & Prince
1992, Destexhe et al 1996) such that thalamic reticular cells can generate lowthreshold Ca2+ spikes upon depolarization, even at membrane potentials of
−65 mV. This particular property is important for the generation of synchronized thalamocortical rhythms, such as spindle waves, because the excitation of
thalamic reticular neurons by thalamocortical and corticothalamic cells drives
these rhythms (see below).
A pronounced after-hyperpolarization follows the generation of each lowthreshold Ca2+ spike in thalamic reticular neurons as a result of an apaminsensitive Ca2+ -activated K+ conductance (IKCa ) (Avanzini et al 1989, Bal &
McCormick 1993). This after-hyperpolarization by itself can be sufficient in
amplitude and duration to remove enough inactivation of IT in thalamic reticular neurons to result in the generation of an additional low-threshold Ca2+
spike (Figure 3A1 ). Through an interaction between IT and IKCa , therefore,
these cells may generate rhythmic bursts of action potentials. The kinetics
of IT and IKCa interact with the properties of thalamic reticular cells such
that rhythmic firing occurs at frequencies of 0.5 to 12 Hz, depending upon
the membrane potential of the cell (Avanzini et al 1989, Bal & McCormick
1993). Hyperpolarization of thalamic reticular neurons facilitates the occurrence and intensity of low-threshold Ca2+ spikes, but also reduces the frequency with which these neurons intrinsically oscillate (Bal & McCormick
1993).
Rhythmic burst firing in thalamic reticular neurons is often followed by a prolonged “tail” of single-spike activity in vivo and in vitro (Figure 3A1 ) (Domich
et al 1986, Steriade et al 1986, Bal & McCormick 1993). This tonic tail of
activity appears to be generated through the activation of a Ca2+ -activated nonselective cation current (ICAN ). Thus, thalamic reticular cells are endowed with
the intrinsic propensity to generate (a) sequences of activity that take the form
of burst-burst-burst-burst-tonic firing at relatively hyperpolarized membrane
potentials (e.g. −65 mV or so) and (b) tonic, also known as single-spike, activity following depolarization to membrane potentials positive to approximately
−55 mV (Figure 3), a state that can be imposed upon these cells through the
actions of a variety of neuromodulatory transmitters (see below).

Figure 3 Idealized scheme of the ionic basis of rhythmic burst and tonic firing in thalamic reticular
(perigeniculate) cells. Removal of a hyperpolarizing current pulse results in a low-threshold Ca2+
spike, which activates a high-frequency burst of action potentials mediated by the transient Na+
current INa and various K+ currents, collectively referred to as IK . In addition, the fast Na+ spikes
also are likely to activate high-threshold Ca2+ currents, referred to here as ICa . The entry of Ca2+
results in the activation of Ca2+ -activated K+ current and therefore an after-hyperpolarization. The
depth and duration of this after-hyperpolarization determines the amplitude of the subsequent lowthreshold Ca2+ spike, which is activated by the relaxation of the after-hyperpolarization. In addition
to activating a Ca2+ -activated K+ current, the entry of Ca2+ into the cell is also proposed to activate
a Ca2+ -activated nonselective cation current (ICAN ) that results in a slow after-depolarization and
the generation of tonic discharge at the end of the oscillatory burst firing ( A1 , A2 ). Activation of
serotoninergic, noradrenergic, or glutamate metabotropic receptors results in a tonic depolarization
of the cell, in part through the reduction of a resting “leak” potassium conductance (IKL ) that results
in single-spike activity in the frequency range of 30–60 Hz. The frequency of this tonic activity
may largely be determined by the interaction of the persistent Na+ current (INap ) and the currents
involved in action potential generation (B1 , B2 ). (From Bal & McCormick 1993.)

(see below), results in the generation of GABAA receptor–mediated inhibitory
postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in thalamocortical neurons (Figure 4A–C) (Deschˆenes et al 1984, Thomson 1988, Huguenard & Prince 1994, Warren et al
1994, Bal et al 1995a,b, Sanchez-Vives et al 1995). These IPSPs can be sufficiently large in amplitude and long in duration to result in the generation of a
rebound low-threshold Ca2+ spike, even if they are generated by only a single
perigeniculate neuron (Figure 4C).
The activation of thalamic reticular neurons can also activate GABAB receptors in thalamocortical cells (Huguenard & Prince 1994, Bal et al 1995a,b,
Sanchez-Vives et al 1995). The activation of GABAB receptors results, as it
does in other central neurons, in the generation of slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials through the activation of a G protein and an increase in a K+
conductance (Crunelli et al 1988, McCormick 1991, Soltesz & Crunelli 1992).
The long duration of GABAB receptor–mediated IPSPs facilitates the removal
of inactivation of the low-threshold Ca2+ current; therefore these IPSPs can
be followed by pronounced low-threshold Ca2+ spikes. Initial investigations
suggest that in order to activate enough of a GABAB -receptor IPSP in thalamocortical cells to be able to generate a rebound low-threshold Ca2+ spike, several
thalamic reticular or perigeniculate cells must discharge simultaneously at a
high rate (Sanchez-Vives et al 1995).

Thalamocortical to Thalamic Reticular
Activation of thalamocortical inputs to thalamic reticular and/or perigeniculate
neurons results in the generation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs)
through the activation of excitatory amino acid receptors (Figure 4D–F). Similarly, activation of corticothalamic fibers to thalamic reticular neurons also results in pronounced excitation, owing to the activation of excitatory amino acid
receptors, and this excitation often results in the generation of rhythmic burst
firing in these cells (De Curtis et al 1989, Bal & McCormick 1993, Contreras
& Steriade 1996).
Bal et al (1995b) recently confirmed that thalamic reticular or perigeniculate
neurons form disynaptic loops with thalamocortical cells in the ferret LGNd.
Activation of a burst of action potentials with the intracellular injection of a
current pulse into a single perigeniculate neuron typically results in the generation of a return barrage of EPSPs at a latency of approximately 100–150
ms (Figure 4G and H). These return EPSPs are generated through the rebound
burst firing of thalamocortical neurons. Thus, the prolonged delay (100–150
ms) from the burst of action potentials in the perigeniculate cell and the return EPSPs is largely due to the duration of the GABAA receptor–mediated
IPSP in the thalamocortical neuron (80–130 ms). A second cause for the delay is the time required for the generation of a Ca2+ spike to result in the

generation of a burst of action potentials (Bal et al 1995a). Surprisingly, the
number of action potentials in the perigeniculate neuron that is required to generate rebound action potentials in a thalamocortical neuron can be remarkably
small, with only two action potentials in a well-connected perigeniculate cell
resulting in return EPSPs when the cells are at membrane potentials of around
−65 mV.
The neurons of the thalamic reticular and perigeniculate nuclei innervate one
another through local axonal collaterals, and perhaps in some species through
dendrodendritic synapses (Ide 1982, Deschˆenes et al 1985, Uhlrich et al 1991),
and inhibit one another through GABAA , and possibly GABAB , receptors (Figure 4J and K) (Ulrich & Huguenard 1995, Sanchez-Vives et al 1995). Intracellular recordings from perigeniculate neurons during the generation of spindle
waves typically reveal barrages of EPSPs followed by, and overlapping with,
barrages of IPSPs (Figure 4L) (Bal et al 1995b). Presumably these EPSPIPSP barrages in the GABAergic neurons arise from the burst discharges of
thalamocortical neurons followed by the induced burst discharges of neighboring perigeniculate cells (Bal et al 1995b). These GABAA receptor–mediated
fast IPSPs strongly regulate the response of the perigeniculate neurons to the

inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). Generation of a tonic train of action potentials in the
perigeniculate neuron through the intracellular injection of a current pulse results in a barrage of
IPSPs in the thalamocortical cell but does not result in a rebound low-threshold Ca2+ spike. In
contrast, activation of the perigeniculate neuron in the burst firing mode results in a larger IPSP and

summation. (G–I ) Pairs of perigeniculate and thalamocortical cells form reciprocal connections.
Activation of a single perigeniculate cell (H ) results in a rebound burst of action potentials in

potentials in a single thalamocortical cell (I ) results in a burst of action potentials in a perigeniculate cell and the generation of feedback IPSPs in the thalamocortical cell. (J–K ) Perigeniculate
neurons inhibit one another. Activation of perigeniculate neurons with the local application of
glutamate results in the generation of IPSPs in a neighboring perigeniculate cell. (L) During the
generation of spindle waves, perigeniculate cells receive barrages of EPSPs followed by IPSPs.
Presumably the IPSPs are generated from the burst-firing of neighboring perigeniculate cells that
are activated by the barrages of EPSPs from thalamocortical cells. (Parts B, C, and H from T Bal

barrages of EPSPs. Block of GABAA receptors results in a large increase in the
amplitude of the EPSP barrages and burst discharges of perigeniculate neurons
(Bal et al 1995b, Sanchez-Vives et al 1995). Thus, the thalamic reticular and
perigeniculate nuclei are envisioned to represent an interactive sheet of mutually inhibitory cells. The excitation of a particular point in these nuclei is
expected to lead to the inhibition of neighboring GABAergic neurons. In the
relay nuclei of the thalamus, this may appear as a central region of inhibition
surrounded by an annulus of disinhibition.

Corticothalamic Inputs to Thalamocortical and Thalamic
Reticular Neurons
Stimulation of the corticothalamic inputs to thalamocortical neurons results
in monosynaptic EPSPs that involve both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors
and in disynaptic IPSPs that involve intranuclear GABAergic interneurons and
thalamic reticular cells (Deschˆenes & Hu 1990a, Scharfman et al 1990, von
Krosigk & McCormick 1992). The monosynaptic EPSPs on thalamocortical neurons exhibit features that are consistent with the convergence of inputs
from many layer-VI neurons onto single thalamocortical cells; they also exhibit
marked frequency-dependent facilitation (e.g. see Deschˆenes & Hu 1990a).
Corticothalamic cells in layer VI may be contacted with thalamocortical afferents, and therefore only a one-synapse loop may separate the thalamus and
the cerebral cortex (White & Hersch 1982). Repetitive stimulation of corticothalamic fibers activates not only the fast ionotropic receptor–mediated
EPSPs in thalamocortical neurons, but also a slow, long-lasting (up to one
minute duration) EPSP that is generated through a reduction in a leak K+
conductance and that may be mediated through the activation of glutamate
metabotropic receptors (McCormick & von Krosigk 1992). These properties
are in marked contrast to prethalamic inputs, such as those from the retina, which
typically do not exhibit frequency-dependent facilitation or the generation of
slow EPSPs (see McCormick & von Krosigk 1992; reviewed in McCormick
1992).

Thalamocortical and Thalamic Reticular Cells Interact to
Generate Spindle Waves
The capability of a burst of action potentials in a thalamic reticular or perigeniculate neuron to generate a rebound low-threshold Ca2+ spike and a burst
of action potentials in thalamocortical neurons, which then returns to the same
thalamic reticular cell as a barrage of EPSPs, is the proposed basis of spindle
wave generation (von Krosigk et al 1993, Bal et al 1995a,b; see also Steriade
& Deschˆenes 1984, Buzs´aki et al 1990, Steriade et al 1993c). The intracellular
recordings of spindle waves in vivo by Andersen & Andersson (1968) revealed

that during these oscillations, thalamocortical cells receive repetitive IPSPs at
the frequencies of spindle wave generation, namely 7–14 Hz. Some of these
IPSPs were associated with the rebound generation of bursts of action potentials,
which these authors proposed had excited the GABAergic neurons responsible for the generation of the IPSPs in the first place. Andersen & Andersson
(1968) envisioned that spindle waves were generated through a circuitous interaction between the excitatory thalamocortical cells and inhibitory intrathalamic
GABAergic neurons. The location of these GABAergic neurons was proposed
to be local, within each thalamic nucleus (Andersen & Andersson 1968). More
recent investigations by Steriade, Deschˆenes, and colleagues, however, have
demonstrated that the GABAergic neurons responsible for spindle wave generation are located in the thalamic reticular nucleus (Steriade et al 1985, 1987).
Surgical isolation of the thalamic reticular nucleus from the rest of the thalamus
abolishes spindle waves in thalamocortical neurons but preserves synchronized
spindle-like oscillations in the thalamic reticular nucleus. These findings led
Steriade et al (1987) to propose that the thalamic reticular nucleus acts as a
pacemaker in the generation of spindle waves. One proposed mechanism was
that thalamic reticular neurons may interact with one another through dendrodendritic and axonal connections to generate and synchronize spindle waves
(Deschˆenes et al 1985, Steriade et al 1987).
Contrary to this suggestion, intracellular recordings from thalamic reticular
neurons have not revealed the occurrence of rebound burst discharges in response to IPSPs, as would be expected if spindle waves were generated through
the interaction with other thalamic reticular neurons. Instead, these recordings have consistently revealed that each burst of action potentials in thalamic
reticular cells is generated by a low-threshold Ca2+ spike that itself is triggered by the arrival of a barrage of EPSPs (Mulle et al 1986, Shosaku et al
1989, Steriade et al 1993b, Contreras & Steriade 1995). These barrages of
EPSPs often occur as clusters of three to five individual events that have the
identical frequency components associated with burst firing in thalamocortical
neurons, suggesting that they originate in thalamocortical neurons (Mulle et al
1986).
The discovery of a slice preparation that spontaneously generated spindle
waves allowed for the detailed analysis of the neuronal circuitry involved in the
generation of this synchronized rhythm (von Krosigk et al 1993). Intracellular
recordings in vitro from thalamocortical neurons of the ferret LGNd revealed
barrages of IPSPs arriving at approximately 6–10 Hz (Figure 5). These spindle wave–associated IPSPs are remarkably similar to those recorded in vivo
(Andersen & Andersson 1968, Steriade & Deschˆenes 1984). Spindle wave
IPSPs in the ferret LGNd are generated through the activation of GABAA
receptor–mediated increases in Cl− conductance and arise from the burst firing

and thalamocortical cells during spindle wave generation. (A) Field potential recording in cat
intralaminar central lateral thalamic nucleus. Filtering of the field potential recording reveals spindle
waves. (B) Spindle waves are generated in vitro by an interaction between perigeniculate neurons
and relay neurons such that perigeniculate neurons inhibit a number of relay neurons, some of which
rebound burst following each IPSP. These rebound bursts activate low-threshold Ca2+ spikes and
action potential bursts in perigeniculate neurons. During the spindle wave, perigeniculate neurons
progressively hyperpolarize, which increases and then decreases their participation in spindle wave
generation. (C ) Blocking GABAA receptors results in the disinhibition of perigeniculate neurons
from one another. It also increases the intensity of action potential bursts in perigeniculate neurons,
increases the activation of GABAB receptors on relay cells, and subsequently increases the bursts
of action potentials in relay neurons. This increase in relay neuron discharge also increases the
activation of perigeniculate neurons. Thus blocking GABAA receptors results in the generation of a
slowed paroxysmal discharge that is critically dependent upon GABAB receptors for its generation.

of nearby perigeniculate neurons (Bal et al 1995a,b). Thalamocortical neurons
generate rebound low-threshold Ca2+ spikes following only a subset of IPSPs at
a frequency of approximately 2–4 Hz (Bal et al 1995a,b), as has been observed
in vivo (Deschˆenes et al 1984, Roy et al 1984). When thalamocortical neurons
do burst, they are in marked synchrony with neighboring thalamocortical cells
(Bal et al 1995a,b, Kim et al 1995). This frequency transformation property of
thalamocortical cells is explained by their intrinsic propensity to rhythmically
burst at 2–4 Hz, owing to the interaction of IT and Ih (Bal et al 1995a, Wang
1994).
Intracellular recordings from perigeniculate neurons revealed repetitive burst
discharges during the generation of spindle waves. These repetitive burst discharges typically occur in the frequency range of 0.5–12 Hz, which is a higher
frequency than that seen in thalamocortical cells. Close inspection of the perigeniculate burst discharges during spindle wave generation revealed that each
is associated with the generation of a low-threshold Ca2+ spike that itself is
activated by a large barrage of EPSPs that result from burst firing in thalamocortical cells (Figure 5). Thus, spindle waves in the ferret LGNd in vitro result
from the interaction of thalamocortical and perigeniculate cells in a manner
that is predicted by their disynaptic connections: The activation of a burst discharge in a thalamic reticular or perigeniculate neuron results in the generation
of an IPSP in a thalamocortical cell. This IPSP removes inactivation of the
low-threshold Ca2+ current, and the repolarizing phase of the IPSP activates
this current, giving rise to a low-threshold Ca2+ spike and a burst of action
potentials. It is this burst of action potentials in thalamocortical cells that subsequently activates once again the perigeniculate neurons. The time required
for one completion of this loop between thalamocortical cells and thalamic
reticular neurons explains the frequency range of spindle waves (6–10 Hz in
ferrets).
In the intact animal, burst discharges in thalamocortical cells communicate
spindle waves to the cerebral cortex. Cortical pyramidal cells respond to the
arrival of these barrages of EPSPs with the occasional generation of action
potentials (Andersen & Andersson 1968, Contreras & Steriade 1996). The
occurrence of such action potentials in identified corticothalamic neurons, as
well as the potent excitatory influence of corticothalamic fibers on thalamic
reticular and thalamocortical neurons, suggests that corticothalamic cells may
also participate in the generation of spindle waves. The simultaneous recording of cortical, thalamic reticular, and/or thalamocortical neurons and field
potentials reveals phase relations that are consistent with the hypothesis that
both the cortical and thalamic reticular neurons are being driven by activity in
thalamocortical cells (Contreras & Steriade 1996).

SPINDLE WAVES CAN PROPAGATE The simultaneous recording from eight sites
in the ferret LGNd in vitro revealed that spindle oscillations propagate across
the slice at a rate of approximately 1 mm/s, or about 100 µm per burst of activity (Figure 6) (Kim et al 1995). This propagation typically occurs in the
dorsal-ventral plane of sagittal slices, starting at one end of the slice and propagating in a somewhat saltatory manner to the other. The propagation occurs
simultaneously in the perigeniculate nucleus and in all laminae of the LGNd
along the lines of projection of connections between these two structures. The
local pharmacological block of excitatory inputs from thalamocortical cells to
the perigeniculate nucleus prevents spindle waves from propagating past the
point of application. The areas of the tissue dorsal and ventral to the block

generate spindle waves independently. On occasion, two different regions of
a normal slice may generate spindle waves that then propagate toward each
other. As long as the two spindle waves do not share the same region of the
slice, they act as independent oscillators. However, once the oscillations propagate to the same portion of the LGNd and perigeniculate nucleus, they become synchronized into one spindle wave (Kim et al 1995). Spindle wave
generation and propagation exhibit a refractory period of approximately 3–
20 s. Owing to this refractory period, colliding spindle waves do not pass one
another.
Activation of even a single well-connected perigeniculate neuron can result
in the generation and propagation of a spindle wave throughout the LGNd slice
if the perigeniculate cell is activated near the end of the refractory period. If
this neuron is in the middle of the dorsal-ventral extent of the slice, then the
spindle wave propagates in a V-like pattern away from the activated perigeniculate cell. Based upon these observations, researchers have proposed that the
propagation of spindle waves in vitro occurs as a result of a zig-zag interaction
between thalamocortical cells in the LGNd and the GABAergic neurons of the
perigeniculate nucleus such that each disynaptic loop of activity between these

(electrode 1) to ventral (electrode 7 ) at a speed of 0.4–0.8 mm/s. Neurons at the ventral end of the
slice (recording sites 6, 7 ) generated spindle waves in a semi-independent fashion. Spindle waves
that started from the dorsal end sometimes did not invade these areas (spindles 3, 5, 10, 16, 18) or
did so with a delay (spindles 14, 15). Neurons at the ventral end (recording sites 6, 7 ) could also
initiate spindle oscillations and generated local (spindles 4, 17 ) or reverse (spindle 11) propagation
of spindle waves. When the spindle oscillations were initiated simultaneously from both dorsal and
ventral ends, the two spindle waves propagated in opposite directions and collided in the middle
(spindle 6). The local propagation of spindle waves and the stoppage of spindle propagation at
the point of collision both indicate the presence of a refractory period for spindle wave generation
and propagation. Dashed line segments represent periods of only weak activity in the extracellular
recordings. The four segments in C are continuous in time, as indicated by the curved arrows.

two cell groups is associated with the recruitment of neurons into the network
oscillation at the edge or front of the activity. However, as the spindle wave
generalizes, the network also starts to become refractory, such that the spindle
wave ends after approximately 1–3 s. First, it ends at the site of initiation;
then, this waning of the spindle wave propagates through the tissue, as did the
growth, or waxing, of the spindle wave (Kim et al 1995).
Previous multiple-site extracellular recordings in vivo have revealed the presence of two types of spindle waves: one that propagates in a manner similar
to that observed in vitro, and one in which propagation is less clear (reviewed
in Andersen & Andersson 1968). In this second type of spindle wave, the
network oscillations occur in widely dispersed regions of the cerebral cortex at
approximately the same time. More recent simultaneous recordings of spindle
waves in anesthetized or sleeping cats suggest that this second type of spindle
wave is by far the most prevalent, although spindle waves that slowly propagate can also occur, particularly in response to local cortical stimulation (D
Contreras, A Destexhe & M Steriade, unpublished observations). The cellular mechanisms by which spindle waves may be generated throughout wide
portions of the cerebral cortex and thalamus in near simultaneity, indicating
rapid propagation throughout the thalamocortical system, are not yet known.
The widespread axonal arbors of a subset of thalamic reticular, thalamocortical, corticothalamic, and corticocortical connections are likely involved (see
Steriade et al 1984, Jones 1985, Felleman & Van Essen 1991). We propose
that the synchronization of spindle waves is largely the result of divergence and
convergence of axonal connections between interacting neuronal groups (see
Kim et al 1995).
MECHANISMS OF GENERATION OF THE SPINDLE WAVE REFRACTORY PERIOD

The mechanisms of the generalization of synchronized oscillations, such as the
waxing of spindle waves, appear to be relatively clear: The presence of axonal connections between the interacting cells recruits additional cells into the
network oscillation. However, the mechanisms by which spindle waves spontaneously stop have been less clear. Previous explanations have centered on the
desynchronization of the network (Andersen & Andersson 1968, Contreras &
Steriade 1996) and the depolarization or hyperpolarization of thalamic reticular
neurons (Domich et al 1986; von Krosigk et al 1993).
Recent investigations in the ferret LGNd in vitro have revealed that events
in thalamocortical cells may explain the waning of spindle waves. Intracellular
recordings demonstrate that the refractory period for spindle wave generation is
associated with a prolonged after-depolarization and an increase in membrane
conductance. Both of these can be activated with an intracellular injection of
repetitive hyperpolarizing current pulses that mimic the arrival of spindle wave

IPSPs. This result indicates that the after-depolarization is generated as an intrinsic property of thalamocortical neurons (Bal & McCormick 1995, 1996), as
was observed previously in spontaneously oscillating thalamocortical neurons
(Leresche et al 1991, Soltesz et al 1991). The spindle wave–associated afterdepolarization results in a marked reduction in the ability of thalamocortical
cells to generate rebound low-threshold Ca2+ spikes following the arrival of
IPSPs from perigeniculate neurons. This reduced ability to generate rebound
Ca2+ spikes presumably results from the voltage-dependent inactivation of IT .
An analysis of the properties of the after-depolarization suggests that it may
be mediated by a persistent activation of the hyperpolarization-activated cation
conductance Ih . Indeed, the after-depolarization, increase in membrane conductance, and spindle wave refractory period are all selectively blocked by the
extracellular application of Cs+ , a known blocker of the h-current. Based upon
these findings, we have suggested that spindle waves may wax and wane during the progressive recruitment of more and more neurons into the oscillation
through axonal collaterals, while at the same time, the h-current may become
more and more activated, resulting in a depolarization of thalamocortical cells
and a progressive reduction in their ability to generate rebound burst discharges,
ultimately resulting in the cessation of this network activity. The spindle wave
refractory period (3–20 s) is the time required for the h-current to return to a
level that allows another spindle wave to occur (Bal & McCormick 1995, 1996;
see also Soltesz et al 1991). What could cause the persistent activation of the
h-current during the generation of a spindle wave? Two possibilities are that
the voltage dependence of the h-current is shifted to more positive levels by
increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, or that the h-current exhibits
slow deactivation kinetics at normal resting membrane potentials (see Hagiwara
& Irisawa 1989, Destexhe et al 1993a,b).

Delta and Spindle Waves May Be Grouped by a Slow
Corticothalamic Oscillation
In the naturally sleeping or anesthetized cat, delta and spindle waves do not
occur continuously but rather can recur on a regular basis in groups every
2–10 s (Steriade et al 1993b,d,e). Simultaneous recordings of cortical, thalamocortical, and thalamic reticular neurons reveal that this slow rhythm is
associated with a relatively synchronized hyperpolarization followed by the
sudden depolarization of all cell types (including local interneurons in the cerebral cortex) (Figure 7) (Steriade et al 1993a,b,d,e, Amzica & Steriade1995a,b,
Contreras & Steriade 1995). The depolarization in cortical cells consists of a
mixture of EPSPs and IPSPs, while the hyperpolarization appears to be a cessation of these synaptic barrages. Cortical-cortical interconnections are critically
important in the generation and synchronization of this slow oscillation, since

it survives massive lesions of the appropriate nuclei of the thalamus (Steriade
et al 1993b,d,e), and synchronization is disrupted with block of intracortical
connections (Amzica & Steriade 1995b).
In the intact brain, cortical and thalamic networks interact extensively during the generation of the sleep EEG, resulting in a coordinated occurrence of
corticothalamocortical rhythms. For example, the initial portion of the depolarization associated with the slow oscillation can trigger thalamic circuits to

generate a spindle wave (Figure 7) (Steriade et al 1993b, Contreras & Steriade
1995), resulting in a pattern similar to the K-complex of EEG-synchronized
sleep (see Niedermeyer 1993). The slow oscillation may also be associated
with the activation of groups of delta (0.5–4 Hz) oscillations in cortical networks (Steriade et al 1993b,e), although the precise cellular mechanisms for
the generation of delta oscillations are still unknown (see Steriade 1993). Stimulation of the brain stem results in an abolition of the slow (<1 Hz) rhythm,
an abolition of spindle waves and delta waves, and a promotion of higher frequency (20–60 Hz) activity (Steriade et al 1993a). Electrical stimulation in
the region of the pedunculopontine nucleus, which is cholinergic, results in a
muscarinic receptor–mediated suppression of the rhythmic hyperpolarization
of the slow oscillation. During this activation, the cortical neurons remain in
the depolarized state. Similarly, repetitive stimulation of the locus coeruleus,
which is noradrenergic, can also result in the suppression of the slow rhythm
through a suppression of the hyperpolarizing lulls between the depolarizing
sequences (Steriade et al 1993a).
Together, these results suggest that the depolarized state is generated by
the reentrant excitation of cortical networks through corticocortical as well as
corticothalamocortical synaptic connections. These reverberating excitatory
circuits are tempered during the depolarized state by the activation of local
inhibitory networks within the cortex and thalamus. The activation of components of the ascending activating system results in a suppression of the various
slow thalamocortical rhythms, presumably through a depolarization of thalamic
neurons and an increase in neuronal excitability in cortical networks (reviewed
in Steriade & McCarley 1990, McCormick 1992).

Perversion of Spindle Waves into Paroxysmal Events
Absence epileptic seizures are characterized by a remarkable 3-Hz synchronized spike-and-wave oscillation in thalamocortical networks that consists of
pronounced burst discharges during the spike interspersed with inhibition during the wave (reviewed in Avoli et al 1990, Steriade et al 1994). The cellular
mechanisms for generation of absence seizures appear to be related to those for
the generation of normal thalamocortical rhythms during sleep. Many children
that exhibit this form of epilepsy have the majority of their seizures during
EEG-synchronized sleep (Kellaway 1985), and at least some animal models of
absence, or spike-and-wave, seizures have revealed a strong relationship between the mechanisms for the generation of spindle waves and the generation
of spike-and-wave seizures (Avoli et al 1990, Buzs´aki et al 1990). Recent investigations in rodent models reveal two key points: Activation of the thalamic
reticular nucleus is essential (Buzs´aki et al 1988) and activation of GABAB
receptors in thalamic relay nuclei is important (Hosford et al 1992, Liu et al

1992, Snead 1992) for the generation of spike-and-wave seizures. Because
activation of GABAB receptors on thalamocortical neurons is particularly efficient in causing rebound burst discharges in these neurons (Crunelli & Leresche
1991) and because activation of the thalamic reticular nucleus can result in the
activation of GABAB receptors in thalamocortical neurons, one might suspect
that a circuitous interaction between the thalamic reticular nucleus and thalamocortical cells may be involved in the generation of these paroxysmal events
(Buzs´aki et al 1990).
The pharmacological block of GABAA receptors in ferret geniculate slices
results in the transformation of spindle waves into paroxysmal activity such that
both thalamocortical and perigeniculate neurons greatly increase the intensity
of their burst discharges and become phase-locked into a 2- to 4-Hz rhythm (Figure 5) (von Krosigk et al 1993, Bal et al 1995a,b). Bal et al (1995a,b) suggested
that this shift from normal to paroxysmal activity resulted from the disinhibition
of perigeniculate neurons from one another, resulting in an increase in discharge
of these cells and a large increase in the postsynaptic activation of GABAB
receptors in thalamocortical neurons (see Huguenard & Prince 1994, SanchezVives et al 1995). The long duration of GABAB receptor–mediated IPSPs enhances the removal of inactivation of IT , thereby resulting in large rebound bursts
of action potentials, which excite the perigeniculate neurons even more (Bal
et al 1995b). Thus, the spindle waves are slowly transformed into a paroxysmal
oscillation that resembles that which occurs during spike-and-wave seizures.
In the intact animal, the cerebral cortex also plays an important, and perhaps
even dominant, role in the generation of spike-and-wave seizures (Avoli et al
1990b, Steriade et al 1994). One hypothesis is that abnormal burst discharges
in the cerebral cortex result in the pronounced excitation of thalamic reticular
neurons. Together, the activity of these two regions may result in the strong excitation of and subsequent inhibition of thalamocortical cells, which could then
result in large rebound bursts that feed into the hyperexcitable cortical network
and thalamic reticular nucleus to reinitiate the next cycle of neuronal discharge.

NEUROTRANSMITTER MECHANISMS UNDERLYING
THE TRANSITION FROM SLEEP TO WAKING
The transition from sleep to waking, or REM sleep, is associated with the
depolarization of thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons (Hirsch et al
1983, Steriade et al 1986). Because the ascending systems of the brain stem
(and hypothalamus) are critical to this transition (e.g. Bremer 1938, Moruzzi
& Magoun 1949), the release of neurotransmitters from these neurons may be
responsible for this depolarization. The search for ascending neurotransmitter systems that innervate the thalamus has identified at least five candidates:

acetylcholine (ACh) from the pedunculopontine and lateral dorsal tegmental nuclei, norepinephrine (NE) from the locus coeruleus, serotonin (5-HT)
from the raphe nuclei, histamine (HA) from the tuberomammillary nucleus
of the hypothalamus, and glutamate (reviewed in Steriade & McCarley 1990,
McCormick 1992).
The investigation of each of these neurotransmitters reveals that the activation of muscarinic receptors by ACh, α 1 -adrenoceptors by NE, and H1 receptors
by HA and metabotropic glutamate receptors results in the prolonged depolarization of thalamocortical neurons as a result of a reduction in a resting leak
K+ conductance termed IKL (McCormick & Prince 1987, 1988; McCormick
1991; McCormick & Williamson 1991; McCormick & von Krosigk 1992).
Activation of each of these receptors results in a slow depolarization of the
membrane potential that results in an inhibition of rhythmic or rebound burst
firing through the inactivation of IT and the promotion of single-spike firing
by bringing the membrane potential closer to the single-spike firing threshold
(Figure 8F). Maximal activation of any combination of these receptors appears
to result in a maximal response of a shift, or nearly complete shift, from rhythmic burst firing to just into the single-spike firing mode, suggesting that this
response exhibits a ceiling that prevents it from causing thalamocortical neurons
to fire at high rates merely from the release of modulatory transmitters.
A prominent response in thalamocortical neurons is the enhancement of the
hyperpolarization-activated cation current Ih by a shift in its activation curve
to more positive membrane potentials, thereby causing more of this current to
be activated at each membrane potential negative to approximately −55 mV
(reviewed in McCormick 1992). This response occurs following the activation of serotoninergic, β-adrenergic, and H2 -histaminergic receptors and the
application of nitric oxide donors, and may be mediated by the activation of
adenylyl cyclase (McCormick & Pape 1990b, McCormick & Williamson 1991,
Pape & Mager 1992). Activation of purinergic A1 receptors has the opposite
effect: It shifts the voltage dependence of Ih to more negative membrane potentials (Pape 1992). Positive shifts in the voltage dependence of Ih increase
the frequency of intrinsic oscillations and also reduce the ability of the cells
to oscillate in both thalamocortical cells maintained in vitro and in computational models (McCormick & Pape 1990b, Soltesz et al 1991, McCormick &
Huguenard 1992).
Together, these results suggest that the release of ACh, NE, glutamate,
HA, and perhaps nitric oxide onto thalamocortical neurons should abolish
sleep-related activity in thalamocortical networks and facilitate the single-spike
activity typical of the waking state. Indeed, application of many of these substances to the A-laminae of the ferret LGNd results in a suppression of spindle
wave generation in vitro (Lee & McCormick 1996a,b).

Figure 8 State-dependent activities in cortical and thalamic neurons. (A–C ) Neurons in the
cerebral cortex (A), thalamic reticular nucleus (B), and thalamic relay nuclei (C ) change their
activities in vivo from periodic and rhythmic spike bursts during natural, slow-wave sleep to tonic
firing of trains of single spikes during waking and REM sleep in behaving cats with chronic implants.
(D–F ) Similar changes in firing pattern occur in vitro in neurons in the cerebral cortex (D), thalamic
reticular nucleus (E ), and thalamic relay nuclei (F ) in response to various neurotransmitters released
by modulatory systems. The depolarization results from the reduction of K+ conductances and the
enhancement of Ih . (From Steriade et al 1993, McCormick 1992, Hirsch et al 1983.)

The GABAergic neurons of the thalamic reticular and perigeniculate nuclei are modulated in a manner that is similar, but also distinct, from that
of thalamocortical cells. Activation of serotoninergic 5-HT2/1C , α 1 -adrenergic,
metabotropic glutamate, or CCKA receptors on these neurons results in a marked
and slow depolarization owing to the reduction of IKL (McCormick & Wang
1991, Bal & McCormick 1993, Cox et al 1995) (Figure 8E). As in thalamocortical neurons, this depolarization of thalamic reticular cells results in a suppression of rhythmic burst firing and the promotion of single-spike activity. In
contrast to this depolarizing response, the application of cholinergic agonists to
perigeniculate and thalamic reticular neurons results in a rapid nicotinic excitation followed by a more prolonged muscarinic inhibition through the activation
of a K+ conductance (McCormick & Prince 1986b, Lee & McCormick 1995).
Recent investigations reveal that the activation of noradrenergic, serotoninergic,

metabotropic glutamate, and CCK receptors on the GABAergic perigeniculate
neurons results in the suppression of spindle wave generation and the promotion
of single-spike activity (Lee & McCormick 1996a,b).
Activation of ascending pathways in vivo complement and extend these findings. The electrical stimulation of ascending cholinergic systems, or cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain, results in muscarinic inhibition in
perigeniculate and thalamic reticular neurons that may be preceded by rapid
nicotinic excitation (Hu et al 1989a, Pinault & Deschˆenes 1992b). In thalamocortical cells, electrical stimulation in the region of cholinergic neurons of
the brain stem results in a rapid nicotinic excitation followed by a slow muscarinic depolarization (Hu et al 1989b, Deschˆenes & Hu 1990b, Curr´o Dossi
et al 1991). Activation of ascending cholinergic systems is associated with
the abolition of spindle and slow waves in the EEG and with the enhancement
of higher-frequency activities, as occurs in the natural transition to waking or
REM sleep (Curr´o Dossi et al 1991, Steriade et al 1993a).
Electrical stimulation in the region of the locus coeruleus also results in a
slow excitation of thalamocortical cells (see Kayama 1985) and a block of slow
rhythms in thalamocortical systems—an effect that is blocked by administration of α 2 -antagonists, presumably by inhibiting the release of NE (Steriade
et al 1993a). In addition, lesion of the locus coeruleus or administration of
α 1 -antagonists results in a marked reduction in the firing rate of thalamic reticular neurons (Pinault & Deschˆenes 1992a).
Together, these results suggest that the transition from the EEG-synchronized
sleep to the waking state is associated with depolarization of thalamocortical
neurons through multiple mechanisms, including increased barrages of fast
EPSPs from prethalamic and corticothalamic systems; the reduction of IKL
from the release of ACh, NE, HA, and glutamate; and the enhancement of Ih
through the release of 5-HT, NE, HA, and other agents. Simultaneously, the
GABAergic cells of the thalamic reticular and perigeniculate nuclei are also
depolarized through the release of 5-HT, NE, glutamate, and CCK. Since the
synaptic release of most, if not all, of these agents increases with the transition
from EEG-synchronized sleep to arousal (reviewed in Steriade & McCarley
1990, McCormick 1992), it is reasonable to suggest that they are responsible
for the transition of thalamic neurons from the rhythmic burst firing to tonic
mode of action potential generation. Presumably, the inhibitory influence of
cholinergic fibers to the thalamic reticular and perigeniculate nuclei helps to
temper these depolarizing influences and provides a mechanism for phasic
disinhibition of thalamocortical neurons during, for example, shifts in attention
or arousal.
The shift from EEG-synchronized sleep to REM sleep is also associated
with an abolition of delta and spindle waves, as well as a marked reduction of

the occurrence of absence seizures, even though this state is associated with
a marked inhibition of neuronal activity in noradrenergic, serotoninergic, and
histaminergic neurons (reviewed in Steriade & McCarley 1990, McCormick
1992). The depolarized state of thalamocortical neurons at this state is presumably the result of the influence of ascending cholinergic and descending
corticothalamic activity. The depolarization of thalamic reticular cells may
result from the combined influence of increased tonic firing in both thalamocortical and corticothalamic systems.
The changes that occur in cortical circuits in the transition from EEGsynchronized sleep to waking and the actions of neuromodulatory transmitters
on different types of cortical neurons appear to be considerably more complex than in the thalamus, perhaps owing to the wide variety of different cell
types and neuronal circuits. Some cortical neurons do, however, exhibit burst
discharges preferentially during sleep, and tonic single-spike activity during
waking (Figure 8A) (reviewed in McCormick 1992). Interestingly, the application of ACh, NE, or a glutamate metabotropic receptor agonist to intrinsically
burst-generating neurons (which typically are subcortically projecting large
layer-V pyramidal cells) results in a depolarization through the reduction of
a leak potassium current and a suppression of burst discharges, as occurs in
the thalamus (Wang & McCormick 1993). This switch from burst generation
to tonic firing is associated with an increase in linearity of the membrane responses of layer-V pyramidal cells (McCormick et al 1993). The excitability of
non-burst-generating pyramidal cells may also be typically enhanced through
the application of modulatory transmitters such as ACh, NE, 5-HT, or HA. This
enhanced excitability results from a reduction in spike frequency adaptation owing to a block of the Ca2+ -activated K+ current IAHP and the voltage-dependent
K+ current IM (McCormick & Prince 1986a, McCormick & Williamson 1989;
reviewed in McCormick 1992). However, in addition to these increases in
excitability, the activation of other receptors results in inhibitory responses.

SUMMARY
Neuronal activity in thalamocortical systems changes in parallel with changes
in the state of the animal. During periods of EEG-synchronized sleep, groups
of thalamic and cortical neurons interact during the generation of synchronized oscillations such as spindle waves and of slow oscillations. This network activity is generated as a consequence of both the intrinsic membrane
properties of the constituent cells and their synaptic interactions. The lowthreshold Ca2+ current is important in the generation of at least some of these
network oscillations. The transition from EEG-synchronized sleep to arousal
is accomplished through a depolarization of thalamic neurons, resulting in an

inhibition of the low-threshold Ca2+ current and an abolition of sleep-related
oscillations. The depolarized state facilitates the transmission of information
through the thalamus in a manner that is consistent with the awake and attentive
state.

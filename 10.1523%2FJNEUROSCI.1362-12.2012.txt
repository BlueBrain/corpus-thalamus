The thalamic output during different behavioral states is strictly controlled by the firing modes of thalamocortical neurons. During
sleep, their hyperpolarized membrane potential allows activation of the T-type calcium channels, promoting rhythmic highfrequency burst firing that reduces sensory information transfer. In contrast, in the waking state thalamic neurons mostly exhibit
action potentials at low frequency (i.e., tonic firing), enabling the reliable transfer of incoming sensory inputs to cortex. Because
of their nearly complete inactivation at the depolarized potentials that are experienced during the wake state, T-channels are not
believed to modulate tonic action potential discharges. Here, we demonstrate using mice brain slices that activation of T-channels
in thalamocortical neurons maintained in the depolarized/wake-like state is critical for the reliable expression of tonic firing,
securing their excitability over changes in membrane potential that occur in the depolarized state. Our results establish a novel
mechanism for the integration of sensory information by thalamocortical neurons and point to an unexpected role for T-channels
in the early stage of information processing.

Introduction
Nearly all sensory information transmitted to the neocortex,
and thus leading to perception, is relayed by the thalamus.
During sensory processing, thalamocortical (TC) relay neurons generally exhibit a tonic discharge of spikes, a pattern of
activity that strongly contrasts with the rhythmically occurring
high-frequency bursts of spikes that are observed during sleep
(Llina´s and Steriade, 2006). This dichotomic behavior of TC neurons during wakefulness and sleep is currently explained by the
properties of the calcium-mediated low-threshold spike (LTS)
that underlies the high-frequency bursts (Jahnsen and Llina´s,
1984). Indeed, LTSs are generated by T-type calcium channels
that are thought to be fully inactivated in the range of membrane
potentials associated with the wake state (Coulter et al., 1989;
Crunelli et al., 1989) and to require substantial and prolonged
hyperpolarizations, such as those present during sleep, to dein-

activate and generate bursting activity (for review, see Llina´s and
Steriade, 2006). More recently, sparse bursting preceded by a
prolonged period of silence has also been reported in awake animals (Guido and Weyand, 1995; Ramcharan et al., 2000; Fanselow et al., 2001; Swadlow and Gusev, 2001; Martinez-Conde et
al., 2002) and attributed to activation of T-channels that deinactivate during the silent period (Llina´s and Steriade, 2006; Wang et
al., 2007). Therefore, the role of T-channels in thalamic physiology has been restricted to rhythmic bursting during sleep or to
occasional isolated bursts during sensory processing, which are
always conditioned by a preceding hyperpolarization.
However, the density of T-channels in TC neurons far exceeds
that required to generate a LTS following strong hyperpolarization (Bessaïh et al., 2008; Dreyfus et al., 2010). Such a high density
of channels results in a physiologically meaningful window
T-current (IT) (Dreyfus et al., 2010), demonstrating the presence
of a number of deinactivated T-channels in the voltage range
(approximately Ϫ60 mV) associated with the wake state (Llina´s
and Steriade, 2006). These data led us to investigate the role of IT
in regulating synaptic information transfer in the depolarized
state. Using the novel highly specific blocker of T-type channels,
TTA-P2 (Shipe et al., 2008; Dreyfus et al., 2010), KO mice lacking
the T-channel Cav3.1 subunit (Kim et al., 2001) and the dynamicclamp technique, we demonstrate that the activation of T-channels
during wake-like states is a major determinant for single and multiple spike occurrence during tonic firing and for the robustness of the
thalamocortical transfer of sensory inputs.

Materials and Methods
In vitro slice preparation. Experimental procedures with animals were
performed according to the guidelines of European Council Directive

Deleuze et al. • Ca2ϩ T-Current Boosts Thalamic Tonic Firing

86/609/EEC and the European Treaties series no. 123, and with the approval of the ethics committee “Ile-de-France Sud” (05– 019).
C57BL/6J wild-type or Cav3.1 Ϫ/Ϫ (Kim et al., 2001) mice of either
sex, 14 –23 d old, were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane and decapitated, and their brain was rapidly removed and immersed in cold
“cutting” solution (4°C) containing the following (in mM): 234 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 MgSO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 10
glucose, pH equilibrated to 7.3 with 95% O2/5% CO2. Horizontal
slices (300 ␮m) were cut from the somatosensory ventrobasal complex (VB) of the thalamus with a vibratome and then incubated in
oxygenated artificial aCSF containing the following (in mM): 126
NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3 and 10
glucose, pH 7.4, at 32°C for 1 h, and subsequently at room temperature, before being transferred to the recording chamber.
Electrophysiology. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of TC neurons located in the VB were performed using a Multiclamp 700B
amplifier (Molecular Devices). Acquisition and filter frequencies
were set at 20 and 10 kHz, respectively. Patch electrodes (tip resistance: 2–3 M⍀) were filled with a solution containing the following
(in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 0.1 CaCl2, 5 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4
Na-ATP, 15 phosphocreatine, and 50 U/ml creatine phosphokinase,
pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH (osmolarity 290 mOsm). The liquid
junction potential (ϩ10 mV) was systematically corrected at the beginning of the recording. All recordings were performed at 32°C.
Access and series resistances were constantly monitored, and data
from neurons with a Ͼ20% change from the initial value were discarded. Recorded TC neurons (n ϭ 77) had an input resistance of
204 Ϯ 10 M⍀ and a resting potential of Ϫ71.7 Ϯ 0.42 mV.
In the absence of current injection, cells presented a quiescent
electrical activity with scattered synaptic inputs of weak amplitude
occurring randomly in a few cells. Glutamatergic and GABAergic
synaptic transmissions were systematically blocked using the ionotropic glutamate receptor blockers DNQX (10 ␮M) and DL-AP5 (100
␮M) and the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine (SR-95531, 10 ␮M).
When necessary, the blocker of voltage-dependent sodium channels
TTX (1 ␮M) was added to the extracellular medium. These drugs were
obtained from Tocris Bioscience. T-type calcium channels were blocked
using the specific blocker developed by Merck TTA-P2 [3,5-dichloro-N-[1(2,2-dimethyl-tetrahydro-pyran-4-ylmethyl)-4-fluoro-piperidinx-4-ylmethyl]-benzamide, 3 ␮M] (Shipe et al., 2008; Dreyfus et al., 2010).
Dynamic-clamp. Our dynamic-clamp system consists of an Intel
Quad-Core computer equipped with an acquisition card (NI PCI-6251
ADC/DAC, M series, National Instruments) connected to the amplifier
operating in current-clamp mode. The dynamic-clamp software is based
on a custom ADC/DAC (analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog) program
used for data acquisition and analysis [Elphy2, developed at Unite´ de
Neurosciences, Information et Complexite´ (UNIC) by Ge´rard Sadoc]
and interfaced with the NEURON simulator version 6.0 (Hines and Carnevale, 1997). NEURON was modified and recompiled to run under the
INtime stack (TenAsys), a kernel driver enabling real-time operation
under Microsoft Windows OS. Stimulation protocols were run in real
time with the acquisition card at 10 kHz.
Thalamocortical neurons receive cortical feedback through direct
excitatory inputs from cortex and indirect inhibitory projections
from the thalamic reticular nucleus, which generate a synaptic background activity. Although the direct excitation of the thalamic reticular neurons by the corticothalamic feedback suggests that excitatory
and inhibitory synaptic noises may be partially correlated in vivo,
such correlation has never been characterized so far, and in the absence of experimental data these conductances were considered as uncorrelated in the present model. Therefore, based on pre-established
models (Wolfart et al., 2005), this synaptic noise was simulated using
excitatory ( ge) and inhibitory ( gi) fluctuating conductances generated as independent stochastic processes and mimicking the effect of
thousands of stochastic glutamate- and GABA-releasing synapses
(Destexhe et al., 2001). The total synaptic current, Isyn ϭ ge(t) (V Ϫ
Ee) ϩ gi(t) (V Ϫ Ei), where V is the membrane potential of the neuron,
and Ee and Ei are the reversal potentials for ge and gi and are set here

to 0 and Ϫ85 mV, respectively, was injected into TC neurons. Each
synaptic conductance was described by a stochastic equation:

dg x /dt ϭ Ϫ 1/ ␶ x ͑ g x Ϫ g x0 ͒ ϩ ͑ ͱ͓ 2 ␴ x2 / ␶ x ͔͒ ␰ x ͑ t ͒ ,
where gx is for ge or gi, ␶x is the correlation time, ␴x2 is the variance of the
conductance, and ␰x(t) is a Gaussian noise of zero mean and unit
variance.
We reproduced the conductance state observed in thalamus during
activated states in vivo (Contreras et al., 1996), by increasing the input
conductance of the cell by 50% via the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
components with a ge/gi ratio of 0.25 (magnitude range: ge, 0.46 –2.8 nS;
gi, 1.8 –11 nS). The correlation time constants were adjusted to 2.7 ms
(␶e) and 10.5 ms (␶i) to match the power spectrum of synaptic conductances resulting from thousand of randomly releasing synapses
(Destexhe et al., 2001). The variance of the conductance was set to
75% of the mean value.
Experimental protocols. Sensory glutamatergic AMPA receptor conductances that evoked fast somatic EPSPs (Turner and Salt, 1998) were
modeled according to Destexhe et al. (1998a), as follows:

IAMPA ϭ gAMPA r͑V Ϫ EAMPA͒
where gAMPA is the maximal conductance, EAMPA is the reversal potential (set here to 0 mV), and r is the fraction of the receptors in the open
state defined as follows:

dr/dt ϭ ␣ ͑ 1 Ϫ r ͒ Ϫ ␤ r
r ϱ ϭ ␣ C max/͑␣ Cmax ϩ ␤͒

␶ r ϭ 1/ ͑ ␣ C max ϩ ␤͒
with ␣ ϭ 0.94 / ms mM, ␤ ϭ 0.18 / ms mM, Cmax ϭ 0.5 mM. The simulated
postsynaptic currents presented a 5 ms decay time constant that was
consistent with the fast kinetics of the sensory-evoked synaptic current in
VB neurons (Miyata and Imoto, 2006; Hsu et al., 2010).
The following two types of stimulation patterns were used: (1) AMPA
conductances of fixed amplitude (15–50 nS) set to trigger a probability of
firing close to 0.5 in the biological neuron were distributed following a
Poisson process (mean frequency, 10 Hz); and (2) randomized sequences
of AMPA conductances with variable peak magnitude (maximal range,
0 –90 nS with 1 nS steps) distributed at a fixed frequency (2 Hz) to elicit
independent inputs.
During these sensory stimulation paradigms, the cortical feedback synaptic bombardment was systematically and continuously simulated in TC neurons and the membrane potential was stabilized at a given target mean value
(Vtarget). First, the fluctuating voltage excluding sensory responses was averaged within a moving window of 100 ms (Vaverage) and an update current
was calculated as follows:

I update ϭ g͑Vaverage Ϫ Vtarget͒,
where g ϭ 200 nS. This resulting current was used to perform a weighted
update on the injected current such as Iinjected ϭ Iprevious ϩ (Iupdate Ϫ
Iprevious)/w, where Iprevious was the previously injected current and w ϭ
10 6. This procedure ensured smooth variations of the injected current in
response to a slowly changing level of membrane potential.
Data analysis and statistics. The response to Poisson distributed input
series was estimated by calculating the mean firing rate (in spikes per
second).
The response to 2 Hz independent inputs was quantified as the probability that a given AMPA input level generates at least one spike within 30 ms
after the onset of the stimulus. The resulting probabilities were used to construct the input– output curve (transfer function) that was fitted to a sigmoidal function: 1 Ϫ 1/(1 ϩ exp[(x Ϫ gAMPA0.5)/dx]), where gAMPA0.5 is the
AMPA conductance required to elicit a firing probability of 0.5.
Single-spike and multispike responses were further distinguished. Responses were considered as multispikes if the interspike interval (ISI) was
Ͻ10 ms. Single-spike responses were fitted using a Gaussian function,
A/[w͌(␲/2)]exp[Ϫ2(x Ϫ xc) 2/w 2], where xc is the x peak value, w is the
width, and A is the area of the Gaussian.

EPSPs evoked in the presence of TTX by the 2 Hz independent inputs
were averaged to perform the AMPA-triggered average analysis.
Results are reported as the mean Ϯ SEM. Paired Student’s t test was
used to compare the data collected with and without T-current or at
different voltage levels. Independent Student’s t test was used to compare
the voltage dependence of data obtained from the Poisson process paradigm in control conditions and after T-current blockade.
Model of intrinsic currents and computational simulations. A singlecompartment conductance model of TC neurons based on Destexhe et
al. (1998b) was developed and challenged by sensory gAMPA conductances and ge, gi fluctuating noise conductances as in vitro experiments.
Thirty-minute-long simulations were typically performed.
The model TC neuron was constructed as follows:

of the model neuron, Ileak is the leak current, IT is the T-type Ca 2ϩ current
simulated by a Hodgkin–Huxley-like model fitted to experimental data using empirical functions of voltage (Huguenard and McCormick, 1992;
Destexhe et al., 1998b), Ih is the hyperpolarization-activated nonspecific cationic current, INa is the voltage-dependent Na ϩ current, and IK is the delayed
rectifier K ϩ current (adapted from Traub and Miles, 1991), to match the
spike threshold of the experimentally recorded neurons; each was respectively simulated as follows:

The variable Q was set to 2.5 corresponding to an experimental temperature of 34°C assuming a Q10 value of 2.5 with an extracellular Ca 2ϩ
concentration of 2 mM (Coulter et al., 1989).
The same IT model was used to inject artificial IT into recorded TC
neurons with the dynamic-clamp technique when required. For each

T-current-dependent responses. In model TC neurons, selection of
EPSPs that failed to trigger a spike in the absence of T-conductance (gT) (see
Fig. 5) was performed as follows. First, a given sequence of gAMPA inputs
of various amplitudes and ge/gi noise was run successively in model TC
neuron incorporating the gNa conductance with or without the gT. In
these simulations, the gAMPA events that only evoked firing when gT was
present were selected. In a second step, the same simulations were run in
model TC neuron devoid of gNa to isolate the EPSP waveforms and EPSPs
generated by the previously selected gAMPA events were averaged.

Results
Thalamocortical response to sensory input is tuned by background synaptic fluctuations induced by the cortical glutamatergic feedback and the GABAergic intrathalamic activity (Wolfart
et al., 2005). In vivo cortical activity depolarizes TC neurons
within a 10 mV range of potential, from approximately Ϫ70 mV
up to Ϫ60 mV (Dossi et al., 1992). To reproduce in the TC
neurons recorded in vitro the noisy synaptic environment of the
activated “wake-like” state, we systematically added excitatory
and inhibitory fluctuating conductances to the cell membrane,
together with sensory-like AMPA conductances using the
dynamic-clamp technique. This technique allowed replaying the
same sequences of sensory AMPA EPSPs and fluctuating synaptic
noise during successive experimental conditions (Wolfart et al.,
2005; Destexhe and Bal, 2009).

Figure 1. T-current boosts stimulus-evoked firing at depolarized membrane potentials. A, Spike raster plots of five TC neurons injected with gAMPA of fixed amplitude following a Poisson
distribution (mean frequency: 10 Hz). Neurons were continuously submitted to ge and gi noise, and displayed a mean membrane potential of Ϫ60 mV. For each neuron, the same gAMPA/noise
sequence was successively injected in the presence [control (CTR)] and absence (TTA-P2) of the T-current. The intracellular activity recorded in neuron 5 during the time windows indicated by the
black line in A is illustrated in B. The consistent decrease in the number of spikes in TTA-P2 compared with the control condition demonstrates the contribution of T-channels to the firing probability
at depolarized potentials. C, Mean firing rates calculated in eight neurons submitted to the same protocol as in A. D, Model TC neurons with different T-conductances were submitted to the same
protocol as in A. The calculated mean firing rates are plotted for each T-conductance values ( gT: left circles, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125 nS from bottom to top; no gT: right circle) and show that the density
of the T-current directly controls the firing probability of TC neurons at depolarized potential. E, Cumulative distribution (for the eight neurons presented in C) of ISIs preceding T-current-dependent
spikes evoked in the control condition. Spikes were qualified as T-current dependent when they disappeared upon TTA-P2 application. The histogram was normalized to the total area.

T-current increases spike probability in response to sensory
synaptic inputs during activated-like states
TC neurons maintained at a depolarized holding potential
(Ϫ60.1 Ϯ 0.1 mV, n ϭ 8) were submitted to the same temporal
sequence of Poisson-distributed AMPA conductances and synaptic noise in a control condition and in the presence of the
specific T-current antagonist, TTA-P2 (Dreyfus et al., 2010). In
all recorded neurons, the number of spikes evoked by the AMPA
inputs systematically decreased upon T-current blockade (Fig.
1 A–C), inducing a 42.3 Ϯ 7.3% reduction in the mean firing rate.
We checked that this decrease in the mean firing was not due to a
slow run-down of the neuronal activity by performing similar
long-term recordings without the application of TTA-P2 in six
neurons. In these control experiments, a negligible 1.6 Ϯ 10.3%
increase in the mean firing rate was observed, confirming the
stability of the TC neuron excitability when the T-current was
present. Therefore, in contrast to current views, these results
clearly demonstrated that T-current plays a significant role in the
tonic firing during activated-like states. Moreover, 32 Ϯ 3% of
the spikes that disappeared upon TTA-P2 application occurred
after an interspike interval Ͻ100 ms, contradicting a criterion
commonly used in in vivo extracellular recordings (Guido and
Weyand, 1995; Ramcharan et al., 2000; Fanselow et al., 2001;

Swadlow and Gusev, 2001; Martinez-Conde et al., 2002) to detect
T-current-dependent firing (Fig. 1 E).
A similar protocol applied to model TC neurons with
T-conductances of various amplitudes showed that the mean firing
rate was positively linked to the magnitude of the T-conductance
(Fig. 1D). This result suggests that TC neurons that present a high
excitability in the wake-like state express a large T-current and therefore a significant number of deinactivated T-channels at depolarized
potentials.
To further characterize the role of the T-current in the transfer
of sensory inputs, we submitted TC neurons maintained at a
depolarized membrane potential (Ϫ58.2 Ϯ 0.5 mV, n ϭ 12) to
simulated AMPA inputs of various amplitudes delivered at a 2 Hz
frequency (Wolfart et al., 2005). As illustrated in Figure 2 B, only
the largest AMPA conductances were able to evoke firing when
the T-current was antagonized and the transfer function (see
Materials and Methods) presented a significant shift toward
larger AMPA values (Fig. 2C). We conclude therefore that the
T-current not only boosts the response to small AMPA inputs,
but increases the firing probability on the whole range of tested
AMPA conductances. Quantification performed on the whole
TC neuron population indicated that significantly larger AMPA
conductances are required to achieve a 0.5 firing probability

and in the presence of TTA-P2. The neuron received the same fluctuating excitatory and inhibitory conductance noise in each condition and displayed a mean membrane potential of Ϫ58 mV. The
smallest AMPA conductances failed to evoke a spike when the T-current was blocked (red) and the spike probability was restored upon artificial gT injection (light blue). C, Transfer functions of the
neuron presented in B show that the T-current block shifted the input– output curve toward larger AMPA conductances (same color code as in A and B). Recovery was obtained with injection of gT.

15.47 Ϯ 1.60 nS, TTA: 18.06 Ϯ 2.08 nS; n ϭ 12; p Ͻ 0.01). In
addition, the number of spikes evoked per input was reduced
upon T-current blockade from 1.12 Ϯ 0.23 to 0.90 Ϯ 0.22 (n ϭ
12; p Ͻ 0.01) for the entire range of tested AMPA conductances.
The magnitude of the effect was nevertheless variable among TC
neurons, but the direction of changes was always consistent and
the T-current-dependent shift in the transfer function was clearly
present in 8 of the 12 recorded neurons (control: 16.65 Ϯ 1.68 nS;
TTA: 20.79 Ϯ 2.19 nS; n ϭ 8; p Ͻ 0.001). To confirm that this
effect specifically depended on T-current, we showed that the
shift of the transfer function in the presence of TTA-P2 was reversed by introducing an artificial T-conductance using the
dynamic-clamp technique (n ϭ 5; Fig. 2 A–C). Moreover, in
computational simulations, gAMPA0.5 values are inversely related to the T-conductance magnitudes (Fig. 2 E), suggesting that
the density of T-channels expressed in TC neurons tightly controls the firing probability of sensory AMPA inputs in activatedlike states.
Single-spike and multispike responses at depolarized
membrane potential rely on T-current
As the block of the T-current affected both single-spike and multispike responses (Figs. 2 B, 3A), we conducted a detailed analysis
of the AMPA-induced responses on the eight neurons that demonstrated a clear shift of their transfer function upon block of
T-current. The range of AMPA conductances generating singlespike responses was shifted toward larger values upon TTA-P2
application, and the threshold to trigger a single spike became
higher (Fig. 3). Moreover, the probability of generating a multispike response drastically decreased or collapsed in the absence of
T-current (Fig. 3B). Therefore, 36 Ϯ 6% of the single-spike responses were silenced, a large majority (79 Ϯ 8%) of spike doublets was transformed into single spikes and an equivalent
proportion of triplets was transformed either into doublets (63 Ϯ

7%) or single spikes (19 Ϯ 6%). In conclusion, it clearly appears
that the T-current controls both the single-spike and multispike
responses generated at depolarized membrane potential in response to excitatory inputs.
Moreover, when multispike responses still occurred in the
absence of the T-current, their patterns were very similar to the
ones evoked in the presence of the T-current with only a slight
increase in the first ISI duration (first ISI: 3.72 Ϯ 0.25 ms in
control vs 4.19 Ϯ 0.37 ms in TTA-P2; n ϭ 7; p Ͻ 0.05; second ISI
3.69 Ϯ 0.39 ms in control vs 3.94 Ϯ 0.49 ms in TTA-P2; n ϭ 3).
Therefore, T-current-dependent multispikes cannot be identified on the basis of their ISI pattern.
T-channel recruitment maintains TC neuron excitability
across voltage changes
Because the T-channel activation and inactivation curves overlap
between Ϫ70 and Ϫ55 mV (Dreyfus et al., 2010), we hypothesized that the T-current recruitment by sensory inputs should be
preserved upon hyperpolarization of the TC neuron in this physiological range of potential and moreover that its impact on the
TC response may be enhanced by the increased proportion of
deinactivated T-channels. When TC neurons maintained at three
different membrane potentials (range: Ϫ55 to Ϫ72 mV) were
successively submitted to the same sequence of AMPA inputs of
various amplitudes, a large proportion of the small AMPA conductances failed to evoke a spike upon hyperpolarization when
T-current was blocked, whereas the spike probability was largely
preserved in the control condition (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, the
transfer function of the TC neurons was quasi-stable across
the entire voltage range when T-current was present but
shifted toward larger inputs upon hyperpolarization in absence of T-current (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, in TC neurons
from Cav3.1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice that lack endogenous T-channels, a similar shift of the transfer function toward larger AMPA conductances was induced while hyperpolarizing the recorded

Figure 3. T-current contributes to single-spike and multispike firing. A, Examples of firing activity in response to gAMPA of increasing amplitudes recorded in a TC neuron submitted to the same
excitatory/inhibitory noise in the control condition (CTR) and in the presence of TTA-P2 (TTA-P2; gT), as in Figure 2 B. Both single-spike and multispike responses were conditioned by the presence
of the T-current. Histograms in B present the probability of single-spike (gray area) and multispike (black curve) generation as a function of the gAMPA amplitude in each condition. In the absence
of T-current, the single-spike probability curve was shifted toward larger gAMPA and the multispike probability was drastically reduced. The single-spike probability was fitted to a Gaussian function
(colored line) to estimate the gAMPA conductance leading to the maximal probability (dashed line). C, The graph presents the gAMPA conductance leading to the maximal single-spike probability

neurons (Fig. 4C). Quantification performed on the whole TC
neuron population (Fig. 4 D) indicated that significantly
larger AMPA conductances were required to achieve a 0.5
firing probability at hyperpolarized potentials when the
T-current was pharmacologically blocked by TTA-P2 or genetically removed using Cav3.1 Ϫ/Ϫ mice, but the gAMPA0.5
was either unchanged or even decreased when T-current was
present. Numerical simulation showed an inverse relationship
between the amplitude of the T-conductance and the magnitude of the shift in the transfer function upon hyperpolarization (Fig. 4 E).
Thus, T-current not only contributes to the tonic firing in TC
neurons but, due to its graded deinactivation with increasing
hyperpolarization, also stabilizes the excitability of the neuronal
population across a range of membrane voltages spanned by TC
neurons during the waking state.
T-current enhances EPSPs
To understand how T-current tunes the transfer function of TC
neurons at depolarized potential and stabilizes it throughout
voltage changes, we analyzed the T-current contribution to EPSP
evoked by artificial AMPA conductances in the presence of TTX
to block spike generation. At hyperpolarized potentials, the averaged EPSP waveforms were clearly enhanced by the presence of
T-current (Ϫ70 mV: amplitude control 27.4 Ϯ 1.5 mV, TTA-P2
22.2 Ϯ 1.4 mV, p Ͻ 0.01; half-width control 27.6 Ϯ 1.9 ms,

TTA-P2 20.6 Ϯ 2.3 ms, p Ͻ 0.001; Ϫ65 mV: amplitude control
22.8 Ϯ 1.7 mV, TTA-P2 20.1 Ϯ 1 mV p Ͻ 0.05; half-width control
24.7 Ϯ 1.8 ms, TTA-P2 20.8 Ϯ 1.8 ms, p Ͻ 0.05; n ϭ 8; Fig. 5A),
but an increase in EPSP duration was observed in only two of the
six recorded neurons at Ϫ60 mV (Fig. 5A, inset). However, since
at depolarized potentials many AMPA inputs are large enough to
trigger a spike independently of the T-current, the T-current effect on the averaged EPSP waveform is underestimated when
pooling the whole EPSP population. This was confirmed by numerical simulations successively performed in the presence and
absence of the sodium and T-conductances that allowed isolation
of the EPSPs that required the presence of T-current to generate a spike (see Materials and Methods). As shown in Figure
5B, when considering this selected EPSP population (Fig. 5B2,
IT-dependent responses), the T-current effects on both the
duration and the amplitude of the EPSPs were greatly enhanced and became evident even at the most depolarized potential. We conclude that the impact of T-current on the
transfer function involves a graded enhancement of the amplitude and duration of the EPSPs with hyperpolarization.

Discussion
Our results establish the crucial role played by the T-current in
the tonic discharge of TC neurons, a firing mode encoding sensory information transfer to the neocortex during wakefulness,
and therefore challenge the classical view that restricts T-current

Figure 4. T-current confers robustness to the neuronal response and stabilizes the transfer function of TC neurons across a large range of membrane potentials. A, Voltage traces recorded in a TC
neuron maintained at mean membrane potentials of Ϫ58, Ϫ63, and Ϫ68 mV while being submitted to AMPA conductances ( gAMPA) of different amplitudes. The same sequences of gAMPA and
excitatory/inhibitory noise were injected in every condition. As indicated by asterisks, which point to the loss of spike upon hyperpolarization, the firing probability was barely affected in the control
condition (CTR) while it was highly sensitive to membrane potential changes in the presence of TTA-P2. B, Transfer functions were quasi-invariant in the presence of the T-current but drastically
shifted toward larger gAMPA values upon hyperpolarization when the T-current was blocked. C, Similar voltage dependence of the transfer functions was observed in TC neurons recorded in
Cav3.1 Ϫ/Ϫ knock-out mice devoid of T-current. D, Mean values of gAMPA0.5 were determined in TC neurons successively maintained between Ϫ72 and Ϫ67 mV, Ϫ66 and Ϫ61 mV, and Ϫ60 and
Ϫ55 mV. In the control condition (CTR, n ϭ 16), gAMPA0.5 values remained stable when the neurons were hyperpolarized from Ϫ60/Ϫ55 to Ϫ66/Ϫ61 mV and decreased at a more
hyperpolarized potential. Conversely, when the T-current was blocked (TTA-P2, n ϭ 12) or absent (Cav3.1 Ϫ/Ϫ, n ϭ 9), the required AMPA inputs drastically increased with hyperpolarization of the
TC neurons (paired t test; NS, nonsignificant; **p Ͻ 0.01; ***p Ͻ 0.001). Note that a subset of cells was recorded at different membrane potentials in only one condition, either CTR (n ϭ 8) or TTA-P2

recruitment only to the generation of LTS-mediated burst firing.
Using TTA-P2, a potent and specific antagonist of T-type calcium
channels (Shipe et al., 2008; Dreyfus et al., 2010), and the
dynamic-clamp technique, which allows replaying the same fluctuating conductance sequences (Wolfart et al., 2005; Destexhe
and Bal, 2009) during successive experimental conditions, we
demonstrate that T-current is a major determinant of singlespike and multispike generation at membrane potentials where
T-channels were previously considered to be fully inactivated. A
key physiological significance of these results is that the increased
recruitment of T-channels with hyperpolarization during tonic

firing confers a remarkable robustness to the input– output
transfer function of TC neurons across a wide voltage range.
T-channel activation at depolarized membrane potentials
The exclusive association between T-current- and LTS-mediated
burst firing conditioned by strong preceding hyperpolarization
(Llina´s and Steriade, 2006) emerged from the extensive in vitro
characterization of the T-channel properties. These studies
established the almost complete inactivation of the T-channels
(Coulter et al., 1989; Crunelli et al., 1989) at potentials associated
with the wake state (approximately Ϫ60 mV) (Llina´s and Steriade,

gAMPA of various amplitudes while being maintained at three different mean membrane potentials in presence of TTX. The same
sequences of gAMPA and ge/gi noise were used for each membrane potential in control condition (TTX) and in the presence of
TTA-P2 (TTXϩTTA-P2). T-current largely contributed to the responses evoked at Ϫ70 and Ϫ65 mV, and slightly prolonged the
average EPSPs recorded at depolarized membrane potential (see inset). B1, Average EPSPs simulated in TC neuron model devoid

tential of the TC neurons randomly
fluctuates around a mean value of Ϫ55 or
Ϫ60 mV, the T-current is efficiently recruited by synaptic inputs and boosts the
amplitude and duration of the EPSPs facilitating the generation of both singlespike and multispike responses. Thus, the
role of the T-current in TC neurons cannot be restricted to the generation of highfrequency bursts. In addition, Ͼ30% of
T-current-dependent spikes followed the
preceding spike by Ͻ100 ms, clearly demonstrating that a long silent period is not a
prerequisite for the T-current contribution to TC neuron output at depolarized
potentials. Moreover, the multispike responses that were dependent on the
T-current were temporally indistinguishable from the doublets or triplets of spikes
that persisted in its absence. Therefore,
standard timing criteria do not accurately
separate T-current-mediated from Tcurrent-independent multispike responses and are not a suitable marker for
the involvement of the T-current in TC
neuron firing.

2006). However, the density of T-channels expressed in thalamic
neurons is especially high, and the tiny fraction of T-channels that
are deinactivated at depolarized potentials is physiologically meaningful. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that although the open
probability of the channels is low at Ϫ60 mV, the number of available channels is sufficient to generate a window current that determines the resting membrane potential of the TC neurons (Dreyfus et
al., 2010). Here, we show that the drastic increase in open probability
induced by the depolarization associated with sensory AMPA inputs
further recruits these deinactivated channels, resulting in a transient T-current that boosts the EPSP and increases the firing
probability. Moreover, the amplitude of the current generated
by this small population of deinactivated T-channels is
enhanced by a voltage-dependent phosphorylation process that
specifically occurs at depolarized potentials (Leresche et al., 2004;
Bessaïh et al., 2008). Interestingly, such potentiation of the
T-current is only present in TC neurons of the sensory relay
nuclei (Leresche et al., 2004), suggesting that the transfer of the
sensory information to the cortex requires a non-negligible
T-current at depolarized potentials in TC neurons.

Voltage invariance of the
spike response
Because activation of the T-current and the subsequent boosting
of the depolarizing drive of EPSPs become gradually more prominent with hyperpolarization, the range of membrane potentials
where synaptic potentials can reach the spike threshold increases.
This accounts for the robustness of the spike response across a
large range of voltages, and this newly described intrinsic property impacts on the whole transfer function of the TC neurons
that become quasi-invariant to significant membrane potential
changes in the region between Ϫ55 and Ϫ72 mV. Such voltage
invariance of EPSPs spike probability may be particularly important in the somatosensory system where the information transfer
is believed to rely on a precise spike timing code both at the level
of the trigeminal complex (Jones et al., 2004) and the ventroposterior medial nucleus of the thalamus (Montemurro et al., 2007;
Petersen et al., 2008). Similarly in the visual system, such a voltage
invariance may support the experimentally observed “relative
precision” of the temporal structure in the thalamic neuronal
response, which is necessary to represent accurately the more
slowly changing visual world (Butts et al., 2007; Desbordes et al.,
2008).

Significance for single-spike and multispike recordings
in vivo
A growing number of in vivo studies have reported occasional highfrequency bursts of spikes in sensory thalamic nuclei of awake animals, already suggesting an involvement of the T-current in the
transfer of the sensory information (Guido and Weyand, 1995;
Ramcharan et al., 2000; Fanselow et al., 2001; Swadlow and
Gusev, 2001; Weyand et al., 2001; Martinez-Conde et al., 2002).
However, in these studies the contribution of the T-current is
restricted to the generation of high-frequency bursts and requires
a relatively long preceding hyperpolarization as their authors
only analyzed multispike firing preceded by a 100 ms silent period. In contrast, we clearly show that when the membrane po-

Significance for sensory processing
Finally, due to the convergence of multiple sensory inputs on a
single TC neuron (Brecht and Sakmann, 2002; Descheˆnes et al.,
2003) and because of the strong short-term plasticity at lemniscal
synapses (Castro-Alamancos, 2002), whisker deflection reliably
evokes EPSPs with little difference in kinetics but large variability
in amplitude. Similar properties have been reported for the retinogeniculate synapses (Turner and Salt, 1998; Chen and Regehr,
2000) where synchronization of the retinal inputs and summation of the postsynaptic potentials (Usrey et al., 1998; Weyand,
2007) enhance the firing probability of TC neurons in the visual
thalamus. As a consequence, the sensory code at the level of the
TC neuron may partly depend on differences in EPSP amplitude

12236 • J. Neurosci., August 29, 2012 • 32(35):12228 –12236

and summation. Therefore, the input– output gain function of
TC neurons should drastically condition the translation of this
sensory code based on the EPSP amplitude variability into different firing patterns of single spikes and multispikes. Accordingly,
by closely controlling the input– output gain function of TC neurons, the combination of T-current and synaptic background
activity within the thalamocortical loop (Wolfart et al., 2005)
represents a major determinant of the sensory information that
reaches the primary sensory cortex.

ABSTRACT
The acetylcholine (ACh) innervation of thalamus arises mainly from the brainstem
pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei. By using immunocytochemistry with a
monoclonal antibody against whole rat choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), we quantiﬁed the
distribution and characterized the ultrastructural features of these nerve terminals (axon
varicosities) in the dorsolateral geniculate (DLG), parafascicular (PF), and reticular thalamic
(Rt) nuclei of adult rat. The regional density of ACh innervation was the highest in PF (2.1 ϫ
106 varicosities/mm3), followed by Rt (1.7 ϫ 106) and DLG (1.3 ϫ 106). In single thin sections,
ChAT-immunostained varicosity proﬁles appeared comparable in shape and content in the
three nuclei, but signiﬁcantly larger in PF than in DLG and Rt. The number of these proﬁles
displaying a synaptic junction was also much higher in PF than in DLG and Rt, indicating
that all ChAT-immunostained varicosities in PF were synaptic, but only 39% in DLG and 33%
in Rt. The hypothesis that glutamate corelease might account for the maintenance of the
entirely synaptic ACh innervation in PF was refuted by the lack of colocalization of ChAT and
vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) in PF axon varicosities after dual immunolabeling. These data suggest that diffuse as well as synaptic transmission convey modulatory
effects of the ACh input from brainstem to DLG and Rt during waking. In contrast, the
entirely synaptic ACh input to PF should allow for a direct relaying of the information from
brainstem, affecting basal ganglia function as well as perceptual awareness, including
attention and pain perception. J. Comp. Neurol. 511:678 – 691, 2008. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In the central nervous system (CNS), acetylcholine
(ACh) is implicated in the control of a wide variety of
neural states and functions, such as plasticity of sensory
maps, attention, learning, and memory (Hasselmo, 1995;
Dykes, 1997; Baxter and Chiba, 1999; Sarter et al., 2003,

2005). Maximally released in cerebral cortex and thalamus during waking and paradoxal sleep (Steriade and
McCarley, 2005), ACh has long been known to play an
important role in the regulation of the sleep/waking cycle
(Richter and Crossland, 1949; Jasper and Tessier, 1971;

ACETYLCHOLINE INNERVATION OF RAT THALAMUS
Jime´nez-Capdeville and Dykes, 1996). Because of the
strong involvement of the thalamus in the control of states
of vigilance, there is a wealth of information on the electrophysiological effects of ACh in this brain region (Steriade and McCarley, 2005). Whereas in speciﬁc relay nuclei, such as the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (DLG),
and in intralaminar nuclei, such as the parafascicular
nucleus (PF), ACh may depolarize thalamocortical neurons directly, it hyperpolarizes the inhibitory neurons in
the reticular thalamic nucleus (Rt), with a consequent
disinhibition of the thalamocortical cells that brings them
closer to their ﬁring threshold (McCormick and Prince,
1986; Steriade, 2004). Thus, through direct depolarization
and indirect disinhibition, ACh modiﬁes the state of membrane polarization of thalamocortical neurons, favoring
the relaying of inputs from various motor and sensory
modalities (Sillito and Kemp, 1983; Donoghue and Carroll, 1987; McKenna et al., 1988; Rasmusson and Dykes,
1988; Steriade et al., 1991).
The ACh innervation of the thalamus arises essentially
from the pedunculopontine (PPN) and the laterodorsal
(LTD) tegmental nuclei of the brainstem (Mesulam et al.,
1983; Sofroniew et al., 1985; Woolf and Butcher, 1986;
Hallanger et al., 1987), containing the ACh groups Ch5
and Ch6, respectively, in the nomenclature of Mesulam et
al. (1983). For the rat, a minor contribution of the magnocellular neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert to the
ACh innervation of Rt has also been described (Woolf and
Butcher, 1986; Hallanger et al., 1987; Levey et al., 1987;
Jourdain et al., 1989). The ACh neurons in brainstem
presumably give rise to highly collateralized axons, which
pervade many thalamic nuclei (Woolf and Butcher, 1986;
Pare´ et al., 1988; Steriade et al., 1988; Bolton et al., 1993;
Spreaﬁco et al., 1993).
Within the thalamus, the distribution of the ACh innervation is highly heterogeneous, as initially described with
acetylcholinesterase histochemistry in the rat (Koelle,
1954; Shute and Lewis, 1963, 1967; Jacobowitz and Palkovits, 1974; Parent and Butcher, 1976; Hoover and Jacobowitz, 1979; Albanese and Butcher, 1980; Woolf and
Butcher, 1986), cat (Graybiel and Berson, 1980), and monkey (Olivier et al., 1970). Since the early 1980s, immunohistochemical studies carried out with antibodies against
the more speciﬁc biosynthetic enzyme choline acetyl
transferase (ChAT) have substantiated important differences in the density of ACh innervation among thalamic
nuclei in the rat (Mesulam et al., 1983; Sofroniew et al.,
1985; Ichikawa and Hirata, 1986; Woolf and Butcher,
1986; Levey et al., 1987; Houser et al., 1988), cat (Stichel
and Singer, 1985; Vincent and Reiner, 1987; Hoshino et
al., 2000), and human (Heckers et al., 1992). However,
because of technical limitations, none of these reports
could provide unbiased quantitative estimates of the densities of ACh innervation in actual number of axon terminals (varicosities) per volumetric unit of tissue.
With the advent of ChAT immunocytochemistry, there
were also many reports on the ultrastructural features of
ACh innervation in thalamic nuclei of different species
(Isaacson and Tanaka, 1988; Raczkowski and Fitzpatrick,
1989; Hallanger et al., 1990; Houser, 1990; Kuroda and
Price, 1991a,b; Beaulieu and Cynader, 1992; Schwartz
and Mrzljak, 1993; Patel and Bickford, 1997; Patel et al.,
1999), including rat DLG (de Lima et al., 1985; Hallanger
et al., 1990) and Rt (Hallanger and Wainer, 1988). Here
again, however, despite increasing evidence that, in many

679
parts of the rat CNS, most ACh terminals do not form the
junctional membrane specializations that are the hallmark of synapses (for review see Descarries and Mechawar, 2000), a systematic evaluation of the synaptic incidence of thalamic ACh axon varicosities remained to be
carried out, leaving open the issue of diffuse vs. synaptic
transmission by ACh in this part of the brain.
Several neurochemical investigations have raised the
possibility of a corelease of amino acid transmitters or
neuropeptides by PPN and LTD neurons, which could
support complex forms of signaling in the thalamus (Vincent et al., 1986; Vincent and Kimura, 1992; Lavoie and
Parent, 1994). Recent in situ hybridization studies have
demonstrated an abundance of mRNA coding for the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) in rat brainstem (Herzog et al., 2001), although the precise anatomical localization of VGLUT2 mRNA remains to be
determined in this brain region. Low levels of VGLUT1
mRNA have been detected in the inferior olive, the intermediate reticular zone, and the gigantocellular reticular
nucleus of the rat brainstem, but not in PPN or LTD (Ni et
al., 1994, 1995). VGLUT3 mRNA has been shown to be
present in a subpopulation of ACh neurons of the nucleus
basalis (Harkany et al., 2003; Nickerson Poulin et al.,
2006) and in ACh interneurons of the neostriatum
(Fremeau et al., 2002; Gras et al., 2002; Schafer et al.,
2002; Herzog et al., 2004), but not in PPN (Herzog et al.,
2004). In immunocytochemical studies, both VGLUT1 and
VGLUT2 proteins have been demonstrated to be present
in thalamic nuclei, including DLG, PF, and Rt (Kaneko et
al., 2002), but not VGLUT3 (Kaneko et al., 2002; Varoqui
et al., 2002; Herzog et al., 2004; Nickerson Poulin et al.,
2006; Graziano et al., 2008). Because VGLUT1 and
VGLUT2 mRNA are strongly expressed in the cerebral
cortex and the hindbrain, respectively (Hisano, 2003;
Fremeau et al., 2004), it is assumed that, in the thalamus,
VGLUT1 protein is located solely in corticothalamic axon
varicosities and VGLUT2 in axon varicosities originating
from the brainstem and spinal cord (Graziano et al., 2008).
It has not yet been determined whether VGLUT3 protein is present in the low proportion of cortical or striatal
ACh axon varicosities that make morphologically identiﬁable synapses (Umbriaco et al., 1994; Contant et al.,
1996). However, in the case of dopamine neurons of the
mesencephalic tegmentum, the suggestion has already
been made that the corelease of glutamate might play a
role in the establishment of synaptic junctions by these
axon varicosities (Trudeau, 2004; Descarries et al., 2007).
For this reason, the present study included doubleimmunolabeling experiments with ChAT and VGLUT2
antibodies to examine the possibility of a colocalization of
this glutamate transporter in synaptic ACh terminals
within thalamic nuclei.
Our study focused on DLG, as representative of a speciﬁc relay nucleus that contains inhibitory (GABAergic)
interneurons in addition to excitatory (glutamatergic)
thalamocortical neurons (Ohara et al., 1983; Ottersen and
Storm-Mathisen, 1984); PF, as a prominent member of the
intralaminar nuclear group entirely composed of glutamatergic neurons that project mainly to the cerebral cortex
and neostriatum (Jones and Leavitt, 1974; Nauta et al.,
1974; Descheˆnes et al., 1996; Van der Werf et al., 2002);
and Rt, as entirely composed of GABAergic projection
neurons sending their axon to other thalamic nuclei
(Scheibel and Scheibel, 1966; Houser et al., 1980; Ottersen

and Storm-Mathisen, 1984; de Biasi et al., 1986; Jones,
2007). Some of the results have already been reported in
abstract form (Parent and Descarries, 2006, 2007).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Twelve adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River,
St. Constant, Quebec, Canada), weighing 275–325 g, were
used. All procedures involving animals and their care
were conducted in strict accordance with the Guide to the
care and use of experimental animals (2nd ed) of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. The experimental protocols were approved by the Comite´ de De´ontologie pour
l’Expe´rimentation sur des Animaux at the Universite´ de
Montre´al.

Primary antibodies
The mouse monoclonal antibody against whole, puriﬁed
rat brain ChAT protein (ChAT-17) was a generous gift
from Boyd K. Hartman and Costantino Cozzari (Cozzari et
al., 1990). This antibody displays a high afﬁnity for ChAT
(3 ϫ 1011 liter/M), with a speciﬁc epitope on the ChAT
molecule. Immunoperoxidase labeling of rat or mouse
brain sections with this antibody allows for a light and
electron microscopic visualization of neuronal cell bodies
and their dendritic and axonal arborizations in the distribution and density expected from ACh neurons only (Umbriaco et al., 1994; Contant et al., 1996; Aznavour et al.,
2005). Accordingly, after ibotenic acid lesions of the nucleus basalis, there is almost total disappearance of the
ChAT immunoreactivity in cerebral cortex, except for interneurons (Cossette et al., 1993), and similar observations have been made after 192 IgG-saporin lesions in the
substantia innominata-nucleus basalis regions (Nickerson
Poulin et al., 2006). As also reported by these authors,
dual immunoﬂuorescence with this antibody and the goat
antivesicular ACh transporter AB1578 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) demonstrates a complete overlap in the cell
body labeling of basal forebrain ACh neurons as well as a
distribution of ChAT-immunoreactive axons and varicosities in the cerebral cortex highly similar to that reported
previously (Umbriaco et al., 1994; Mechawar et al., 2000).
The rabbit polyclonal antibody against a fusion protein
containing glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the amino
acid 510 –582 of the rat vesicular glutamate transporter
VGLUT2 was obtained from Synaptic Systems Gmbh
(Go¨ettingen, Germany). It has been fully characterized
and its speciﬁcity veriﬁed in previous studies (Takamori et
al., 2001; Montana et al., 2004; Anlauf and Derouiche,
2005; Zhou et al., 2007). On Western blot, this VGLUT2
antibody labels a single band at 65 kDa (Takamori et al.,
2001; Zhou et al., 2007), corresponding to the molecular
weight of VGLUT2. There is no immunolabeling after
preincubation of this VGLUT2 antibody with the fusion
protein rat VGLUT2/DNPI Strep-Tag (AA 510 –582; Zhou
et al., 2007).
The rabbit polyclonal antibody against VGLUT3 (P45-3)
was a generous gift from Salah El Mestikawy. This antibody was raised against the peptide CETELNHEAFVSPRKKM (Glu531-Met547) at the C-terminus of VGLUT3
and afﬁnity puriﬁed. It detected an intracellular and
punctiform signal on BON cells permanently transfected
with pcDNA3-VGLUT3 but not with plasmids coding for

VGLUT1 or VGLUT2 (Gras et al., 2002). On Western blots
of protein extracted from rat brain homogenates, it
showed a band at 50 – 60 kDa, which corresponds to the
predicted molecular weight of VGLUT3 (Gras et al., 2005).
The immunocytochemical localizations observed in rat
brain with this P45-3 antibody were found to be very
similar to those obtained with a second anti-VGLUT3
antibody (P45-1) raised in rabbit against a peptide (Asp27Asp44) at the N-terminus of VGLUT3 (Gras et al., 2002),
or with a third anti-VGLUT3 antibody raised in guinea
pig against the entire C-terminus (amino acids 522–588)
of rat VGLUT3 (Somogyi et al., 2004). There was no immunolabeling in brain with a preimmune serum for P45-3
or with a P45-3 solution saturated with its cognate peptide
(Gras et al., 2002).

Immunocytochemistry
Brain tissue intended for light (ﬁve rats) and confocal
(one rat) microscopy was prepared as follows. After deep
anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg, i.p.),
these rats were perfused transcardially with 50 ml of
ice-cold sodium phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 50 mM;
pH 7.4), followed by 500 ml of a fresh solution of 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate
buffer (PB; pH 7.4). The brain was rapidly dissected out
and postﬁxed by immersion in the same solution for 24
hours at 4°C. After several washes in PBS, serial transverse 35-␮m-thick sections were cut with a vibratome and
collected serially in PBS. One of every three sections from
ﬁve rats was processed for ChAT immunohistochemistry
as described below. To help in identifying thalamic nuclei,
the second set of adjacent sections was stained for cytochrome oxidase, according to a previously described histochemical protocol (Wong-Riley, 1979), and the third with
cresyl violet. Sections from another rat were processed for
double immunoﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy as
described below.
For electron microscopy, the brains of six rats were ﬁxed
by sequential aortic arch perfusion of 50 ml of cold PBS,
150 ml of 4% PFA solution, 250 ml of 4% PFA ϩ 0.1%
glutaraldehyde, and 250 ml of 4% PFA. After overnight
postﬁxation by immersion in the 4% PFA solution at 4°C,
50-␮m-thick transverse sections were cut with the vibratome, to be processed for ChAT immunocytochemistry
and examined in the electron microscope as described
below.
Single ChAT immunostaining for light microscopy.
The 35-␮m-thick sections intended for light microscopy
were sequentially incubated, at room temperature, in 1) a
blocking solution of PBS containing 5% normal goat serum, 0.5% gelatin, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (2 hours); 2) the
same blocking solution to which 2 ␮g/ml of the mouse
monoclonal antibody against ChAT was added (overnight); and 3) the biotinylated goat anti-mouse antibody
(Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) diluted
1:1,000 in blocking solution (1 hour). After rinses in PBS,
sections were incubated for 1 hour in a 1:1,000 dilution of
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson
Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA), washed in PBS followed by Tris saline buffer (TBS; pH 7.4), and then immersed for 3 minutes in a cold solution of 0.05% 3,3Јdiaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in TBS, to
which 0.005% H2O2 was added. The reaction was stopped
by several washes in TBS followed by PB, and the sections
were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air dried, dehy-

drated in graded alcohol, cleared in toluene, and coverslipped with DPX (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Ontario, Canada), to be examined as described below.
Double ChAT/VGLUT immunoﬂuorescence for confocal microscopy. These sections were incubated for 36
hours at room temperature with both mouse anti-ChAT
diluted at 2 ␮g/ml and rabbit anti-VGLUT2 or VGLUT3
primary antibodies, diluted 1:500. After several washes in
PBS, they were incubated for 4 hours at room temperature
with a mix of Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse
and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGs (1:
500; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), washed in PB and
distilled water, and mounted on microscope slides in
Vectashield mounting medium for ﬂuorescence (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Controls for these doublelabeling experiments included omission of one of the primary antibodies. There was no cross-reactivity of the secondary antibodies. Images were captured with a confocal
microscope (Leica TCS-SP1) using sequential laser analysis and processed in Adobe Photoshop (v. CS2; Adobe
Systems, San Jose, CA).
Single ChAT immunostaining for electron microscopy. Fifty-micrometer-thick sections from four rats
were prepared as described above for light microcopy, but
without Triton X-100 in all solutions. After revelation in
DAB, these sections were osmicated, dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide, and ﬂat embedded in Durcapan
(Fluka), as previously described in detail (Riad et al.,
2000). Rectangular pieces within DLG, PF, and Rt were
removed from the ﬂat-embedded ChAT-immunostained
sections, glued to the tip of resin blocks, and sectioned
ultrathin (80 nm) with a Reichert Jung ultramicrotome.
These sections were collected on bare 150-mesh copper
grids, stained with lead citrate, and examined with a
Phillips CM100 electron microscope (60 kV; Philips Electronique, St. Laurent, Quebec, Canada). In these experiments, immunocytochemical controls included omission of
the primary or the secondary antibody, which completely
abolished the immunostaining. This material was examined as described below.
Double ChAT/VGLUT2 immunolabeling for electron
microscopy. Sections from two rats were incubated for
60 hours at 4°C with both the mouse anti-ChAT and the
rabbit anti-VGLUT2 primary antibodies, diluted 2 ␮g/ml
and 1:500, respectively. The immunoperoxidase reaction
was then performed as described above, with DAB as the
chromogen to reveal ChAT, and the sections were incubated for 24 hours at room temperature in goat anti-rabbit
IgG conjugated to 1-nm colloidal gold particles (AuroProbe
One; Amersham, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) diluted 1:50
to reveal VGLUT2. The sections were then treated with an
IntenSE kit (Amersham) to increase the size of immunogold particles and processed for electron microscopy as
described above. Controls included omission of either one
of the primary antibodies to exclude cross-reactivity of the
secondary antibodies.

Quantitative assessment of the density of
ChAT-immunostained innervation in DLG,
PF, and Rt
An unbiased stereological approach was used to estimate the number of ChAT-immunostained axon varicosities in DLG, PF, and Rt (see Fig. 1). A light microscope
(Leica DM 6000B) equipped with a digital camera

681
(Optronics microﬁre), a motorized stage (X and Y axes),
and a Z-axis indicator (Leica Z axis control) was used. This
system was controlled by a computer running StereoInvestigator software (v. 7.00.3; MicroBrightField, Colchester, VT).
Five equally spaced transverse sections across the entire volume of each nucleus were selected. Intervals between sections corresponded to 315 ␮m in DLG, 105 ␮m in
PF, and 420 ␮m in Rt. At low magniﬁcation, the contours
of nuclei were traced in the left thalamus, with the help of
adjacent cytochrome oxidase sections as a guide. The sampling process leading to estimations of the total number of
ACh axon varicosities in each thalamic nucleus began by
randomly translating a grid formed by 138 ϫ 126 ␮m
squares over the section. At each intersection of the grid
that fell into the nucleus, a counting frame measuring
25 ϫ 25 ␮m was drawn and examined with a ϫ100/1.30 oil
objective. In the light microscope, ChAT-immunostained
varicosities appear as round or ovoid dilations of ChATlabeled axons (see Fig. 2). Varicosities that fell within the
counting frame and that did not contact the exclusion
lines were counted whenever they came into focus within
a 12-␮m-thick optical dissector positioned 1 ␮m below the
surface of the tissue. The thickness of the mounted tissue
was measured at regular intervals during the process,
yielding mean values between 14.1 and 16.8 ␮m for the
ChAT-stained sections. For each thalamic nucleus, the
density of ACh innervation was then expressed in millions
of varicosities per cubic micrometer of tissue, using the
total number calculated by the optical dissector and the
volume of the nucleus estimated in ChAT-immunostained
sections by Cavalieri’s method.
A similar unbiased stereological approach was used on
adjacent Nissl-stained sections to estimate the total number of neurons in each of the three thalamic nuclei, delineated, as above, with the help of adjacent cytochrome
oxidase-stained sections. Sampling sites were randomly
positioned at the intersection of a grid formed by 350 ϫ
350 ␮m squares. The volume of the optical dissector was
100 ϫ 100 ϫ 14 ␮m. Counting was performed with a
ϫ40/0.85 objective. Neurons stained with cresyl violet display a faintly stained cytoplasm but a dark nucleus and
sharp nucleolus. Only neurons with a nucleolus in focus
within the optical dissector were counted. The mean thickness of the cresyl violet-stained sections ranged between
16.3 and 19.1 ␮m. The number of axon varicosities in each
nucleus was then divided by the number of neurons provided by the counting system, to estimate the average
number of ChAT-immunoreactive axon varicosities per
neuron.
On average, 9,563 axon varicosities and 864 neurons
were counted in each rat. Average of the Gunderson (m ϭ
1) and the second estimated coefﬁcient of error (SchmitzHof) yielded values ranging between 0.02 and 0.05 for
axon varicosities and cell bodies counted in the three
thalamic nuclei.

Electron microscopic examination of the
ChAT-immunostained axon varicosities
After single (ChAT) or dual (ChAT and VGLUT2) immunolabeling, ChAT-immunostained axon varicosities
were readily identiﬁed in the electron microscope as round
or ovoid axon dilations, more than 0.25 ␮m in transverse
diameter, containing aggregated synaptic vesicles and often a mitochondrion. These proﬁles were ﬁlled by a ﬁne

DAB immunoprecipitate of variable density, which often
lined the plasma membrane and the outer surface of organelles. After single labeling for ChAT, immunostained
varicosities were sampled at a working magniﬁcation of
ϫ15,500, by taking a picture of every such proﬁle encountered, until more than 100 were obtained from each nucleus in each rat. These pictures were printed at a ﬁnal
magniﬁcation of ϫ39,000, and the ﬁrst 50 or so ChATimmunostained varicosity proﬁles with a full contour and
distinct content were kept for analysis. Equivalent numbers of unlabeled proﬁles were selected at random from
the same prints. For this purpose, a transparent overlay
bearing a ﬁxed mark in its upper left quadrant was used
to identify the nearest fully visible unlabeled axon varicosity in each print. The ChAT-immunostained and randomly selected unlabeled varicosities were then measured
for cross-sectional area and for short and long axes, using
the public-domain Image J software from NIH (v. 1.61).
The varicosities were also classiﬁed as containing a mitochondrion or not and as showing a synaptic complex or
not, i.e., a localized straightening of apposed plasma membranes associated with a slight widening of the intercellular space and a thickening of the pre- and/or postsynaptic membrane. The synaptic junctions were further
characterized as symmetrical or asymmetrical, the synaptic targets were identiﬁed, and the length of junctional
complexes was measured.
The synaptic incidence observed in single sections could
then be extrapolated to the whole volume of varicosities by
means of a stereological formula (Beaudet and Sotelo,
1981), using the long axis as diameter (Umbriaco et al.,
1994). This formula considers the varicosities as spheres
and takes into account the average size of varicosity proﬁles, the length of their junctional complexes, and the
thickness of the section, to predict the probability of seeing
a synapse if there is one made by each varicosity. The
synaptic incidence is then inferred by comparison with
this predicted value. In the study of Umbriaco et al.
(1994), the reliability of this extrapolation was veriﬁed
experimentally by examining a large population of ChATimmunostained cortical varicosities both in serial sections
across their entire volume and as a randomized, singlesection sample.

Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple-comparisons
tests were used to detect signiﬁcant differences in volume,
neuronal counts, regional density of ACh innervation,
number of ChAT-immunostained varicosities per neuron,
and dimensions and synaptic incidence of ChATimmunostained or unlabeled varicosity proﬁles among the
three thalamic nuclei. Differences were considered significant at P Ͻ 0.05.

RESULTS
Density of ChAT-immunostained innervation
in DLG, PF, and Rt
A similar regional distribution of ChAT immunostaining was observed in the thalamus of the ﬁve rats examined
by light microscopy. In accordance with earlier descriptions (Sofroniew et al., 1985; Ichikawa and Hirata, 1986;
Levey et al., 1987; Houser et al., 1988), the overall density
of ChAT immunostaining varied markedly between the

different thalamic nuclei (Fig. 1). The medial habenula
showed the strongest immunoreactivity, because of its
content in small, round and closely packed, darkly immunostained cell bodies, giving rise to the numerous, relatively large, nonvaricose axons visible in the adjacent
fasciculus retroﬂexus. In all other thalamic nuclei, the
immunolabeling was exclusively axonal.
The density of ChAT immunostaining was low in motor
thalamic nuclei (ventroanterior, ventrolateral, ventromedial) and moderate in the sensory relay nuclei (DLG, ventroposterior, posterior), except for the medial geniculate
nucleus, in which it was rather low. In so-called association nuclei, it was high in the mediodorsal nucleus, moderate in the lateral nuclei (lateral, posterior, laterodorsal),
and low in the anterior nuclei (anterodorsal, anteromedial, interanteromedial). As noted previously (Sofroniew
et al., 1985), the ventrolateral part of the anteroventral
nucleus was more densely ChAT immunoreactive than its
dorsomedial part (Fig. 1A). The immunostaining ranged
from moderate to strong in the midline (paraventricular,
paratenial, intermediodorsal), intralaminar (centralateral, PF), and intermediate (central medial, paracentral)
nuclei, with the paraventricular nucleus the less and the
central medial nucleus the most densely innervated. Rt
was strongly immunoreactive.
As observed by light microscopy, there were no striking
differences in the overall conﬁguration of the intricate
network of ﬁne, varicose ChAT-immunostained axons that
pervaded all parts of DLG, PF, and Rt (Fig. 2). Several
thicker, nonvaricose immunostained axons, indicative of
ﬁbers en passage, were seen in DLG and Rt, but not in PF.
In transverse sections of DLG, some of these relatively
thick, nonvaricose ﬁbers could be followed across the entire extent of the nucleus.
As measured with Cavalieri’s method, the respective
volumes of DLG, PF, and Rt were 0.82 Ϯ 0.06, 0.25 Ϯ 0.02,
and 0.76 Ϯ 0.11 mm3 (PF Ͻ DLG and Rt, P Ͻ 0.01). In
cresyl violet-stained sections, the neuronal cell bodies in
DLG, PF, and Rt were of comparable size and shape,
averaging 15.8 Ϯ 0.7 ␮m in diameter. As estimated with
StereoInvestigator, the neuronal density was the highest
in PF (51,465 Ϯ 3,577 neurons/mm3), followed by DLG
(40,069 Ϯ 1,540) and Rt (31,884 Ϯ 3,351; PF Ͼ DLG, P Ͻ
0.05; PF Ͼ Rt, P Ͻ 0.01). The number of ChATimmunostained varicosities per cubic micrometer of tissue
(i.e., the regional density of ChAT innervation) was also
the highest in PF (2.1 Ϯ 0.2 million ChAT-immunostained
axon varicosities/mm3), followed by Rt (1.7 Ϯ 0.2 million)
and DLG (1.3 Ϯ 0.1 million; Fig. 3). However, Rt was more
densely innervated than PF in number of ChATimmunostained varicosities per neuron. There were 57 Ϯ
7 ChAT-immunostained varicosities per neuron in Rt,
43 Ϯ 5 in PF, and 32 Ϯ 2 in DLG. The ChAT innervation
of DLG was the least dense, in terms both of regional
density and of number of axon varicosities per neuron
(Fig. 3).

Ultrastructural features of ChATimmunostained axon varicosities in DLG,
PF, and Rt
The ChAT-immunostained axon varicosities in DLG,
PF, and Rt shared many ultrastructural features (Fig. 4).
Arising from thin, unmyelinated axons, they were generally ovoid and contained numerous, more or less tightly

aggregated, small and clear vesicles, often associated with
one or more mitochondria. As shown in Table 1, the ChATimmunostained varicosity proﬁles were of similar size in
DLG and Rt but signiﬁcantly larger in PF. Their mean
diameter ranged from 0.3 to 1.5 ␮m in DLG, 0.3 to 1.4 ␮m
in Rt, and 0.3 to 2.3 in PF, for respective averages of 0.6,
0.6, and 0.8 ␮m. The unlabeled axon varicosity proﬁles in
PF were also larger than those in DLG and Rt. The proportion of ChAT proﬁles showing one or more mitochondria was higher than that of randomly selected, unlabeled
varicosities, a difference reaching statistical signiﬁcance
in PF (Table 1).
ChAT-immunostained varicosity proﬁles displaying or
not a synaptic junction were observed in all three thalamic
nuclei (Fig. 4). The proportion of ChAT-immunostained
varicosity proﬁles exhibiting a junctional complex in single thin sections was signiﬁcantly higher in PF (25%) than
in DLG (8%) and Rt (10%). Moreover, in DLG and RI, the
observed frequency of junctions was markedly lower for
the ChAT-immunostained than for the unlabeled varicos-

ity proﬁles (Table 2). When extrapolated to the whole
volume of varicosities with the stereological formula of
Beaudet and Sotelo (1981), the synaptic incidence for
whole ChAT-immunostained varicosities in PF amounted
to 109%, suggesting that this ACh innervation is entirely
synaptic. In contrast, in both DLG and Rt, the extrapolation indicated that the ACh innervation is largely asynaptic, with only 33% of the varicosities in DLG and 39% of
the varicosities in Rt making a synapse (Table 2). The very
high (Ͼ100) percentages extrapolated for the unlabeled
varicosities in the three nuclei indicated that the vast
majority of these axon varicosities were synaptic and that
a considerable number made more than one synaptic contact.
Much as the randomly selected unlabeled terminals in
the same nuclei, the synaptic ChAT-immunostained varicosities contacted dendritic branches more frequently
than spines in PF and Rt, but spines more frequently than
branches in DLG (Table 2). This seemed to be associated
with a greater frequency of symmetrical vs. asymmetrical

contacts made by the ChAT-immunostained as well as
unlabeled varicosities in PF and Rt compared with DLG,
but the small number of synaptic ChAT-immunostained
varicosities in Rt and DLG precluded a statistical validation of this relationship. A rare example of ChATimmunostained axon varicosity in close apposition to a
DLG cell body is shown in Figure 4A. It is noteworthy that, in all three thalamic nuclei, including PF,
no axosomatic ACh synapses were observed. ChATimmunostained varicosities were often seen in direct apposition to, but never making a synaptic junction with,
other, unlabeled axon terminals.

Lack of dual ChAT and VGLUT2
immunolabeling

In all three nuclei, these thin axonal branches display rather equally
spaced varicosities, of variable size along the same ﬁber (e.g., small
arrows in DLG). The overall pattern of innervation appears similar in
the three thalamic nuclei. No pericellular arrangements are visible.
Scale bar ϭ 20 ␮m.

As illustrated in Figure 5A, in the confocal microscope,
abundant punctate labeling suggestive of axon varicosities was visualized in PF with either Alexa Fluor 568
(magenta, ChAT) or Alexa Fluor 488 (green, VGLUT2)
ﬂuorophore. However, there was not a single instance of
an axon varicosity labeled with the two dyes in merged
images. In contrast, in tissue processed as a technical
control with the same secondary antibodies and ﬂuorophores, many dually labeled axon varicosities with ChAT
and VGLUT3 antibodies were present in the neostriatum
(see Supporting Information).
In keeping with this result, there were many axon varicosities displaying either ChAT (immunoperoxidase
DAB) or VGLUT2 (immunogold) immunolabeling that
could be observed in PF after the dual immunolabeling for
electron microscopy (Fig. 5B–D), but no axon varicosity
displaying both labeling, after examination of more than
80 ChAT- and 120 VGLUT2-positive axon varicosities. As
in PF, no dually labeled axon varicosities were observed in
DLG and Rt by confocal or electron microscopy (data not
shown).

(D–F), and Rt (G–I) of adult rat thalamus. The ChAT-immunostained
axon varicosities appear similar in shape and vesicular content in the
three nuclei but, on average, are signiﬁcantly larger in PF than in
DLG and Rt (see Table 1). In A (DLG), the immunostained varicosity
is directly apposed to a neuronal cell body (N) but does not display any
area of synaptic membrane specialization, nor does that shown in B.
That in C is seen to make a synaptic contact (between small arrows)

with a dendritic branch (db). Among the three axon varicosities in PF,
two (E,F) exhibit a synaptic junction (between small arrows) on a db.
In F, the junctional complex is clearly asymmetrical. In Rt (G–I), only
the relatively small ACh varicosity proﬁle in I shows a synaptic
junction (between small arrows), which is made with a dendritic spine
(sp). In H, note the presence of synaptic vesicles in the short segments
of unmyelinated axon leading into the varicosity. Scale bar ϭ 1 ␮m.

DISCUSSION
This study revealed new aspects of the distribution and
ﬁne structural characteristics of the ACh (ChATimmunostained) innervation in DLG, PF, and Rt of adult
rat. Data on the number of ACh axon terminal in each
nucleus substantiated the higher density of this innervation in PF and Rt than in DLG. At the electron microscopic
level, the data also demonstrated that a majority of ACh
axon terminals (varicosities) in Rt and DLG do not establish a synaptic contact, whereas those in PF are signiﬁcantly larger and entirely synaptic.

Distribution of ACh axon terminals in DLG,
PF, and Rt
The experimental conditions of the present study allowed for a speciﬁc and optimal immunocytochemical detection of ACh axon varicosities in rat brain tissue (Umbriaco et al., 1994; Mechawar et al., 2000). The ChATimmunostained axon varicosities were visualized across
the full thickness of sections, attesting to a complete penetration of immunoreagents. The immunoreactive varicosities could therefore be counted within the entire thickness of the optical dissector, providing reliable, unbiased
estimates of their number per volumetric unit of tissue.
The present counts in DLG, PF, and Rt are in accordance with previous ChAT immunocytochemical investigations of rat thalamus showing a denser ACh innervation
in PF and Rt than in DLG (Ichikawa and Hirata, 1986;
Levey et al., 1987; Houser et al., 1988). The regional
density of innervation was the highest in PF, but Rt,
which is traversed by fascicles of myelinated axons, exhib-

ited a higher ratio of ACh axon varicosities per thalamic
neuron, because of its lower density in thalamic neurons.
DLG was much less densely innervated, in terms both of
regional density and of number of ACh terminals per
thalamic neuron. However, even in PF and Rt, the regional density of ACh innervation was approximately twofold lower than in rat neocortex or hippocampus (Mechawar et al., 2000; Aznavour et al., 2005). It should also be
pointed out that the density of ACh innervation in DLG
has been reported to be considerably higher in the cat
(Fitzpatrick et al., 1989), monkey (Wilson et al., 1999), and
human (Heckers et al., 1992) than in the rat (Levey et al.,
1987), perhaps because of the greater development of the
visual system in these species.

Ultrastructural characteristics of ACh axon
varicosities
It is obvious from the present and earlier studies (de
Lima et al., 1985; Hallanger and Wainer, 1988; Isaacson
and Tanaka, 1988; Raczkowski and Fitzpatrick, 1989;
Hallanger et al., 1990; Schwartz and Mrzljak, 1993; Patel
and Bickford, 1997; Patel et al., 1999) that no morphological features of ACh axon terminals in thalamus would
have allowed for their speciﬁc electron microscopic identiﬁcation without immunocytochemical labeling. In the
three nuclei examined, these varicosities arose from thin
and unmyelinated axons, were generally ovoid, contained
aggregated small vesicles, and frequently displayed a mitochondrion. A greater incidence of mitochondria in ACh
as opposed to randomly selected, unlabeled varicosity proﬁles has been previously observed in cat DLG (Raczkowski

and Fitzpatrick, 1989) and also in the rat cerebral cortex
(Umbriaco et al., 1994; Mechawar et al., 2002), neostriatum (Contant et al., 1996), and hippocampus (Aznavour et
al., 2005). Also noteworthy was the larger size of ACh as
well as unlabeled axon terminals in PF than in Rt or DLG.
In primary somatosensory cortex, larger ACh axon varicosities in layer V, more frequently making synapse than
those in other layers, have already been noted (Umbriaco
et al., 1994). It was then speculated that anchoring of
these varicosities to their microenvironment by junctional
complexes might favor the accumulation of inner constituents, which could also be an explanation for the larger
size of ACh varicosities in PF compared with Rt and DLG.
The majority of ACh axon terminals in Rt and DLG
failed to show the differentiated zones of membrane spe-

cialization (junctional complexes) that deﬁne synapses.
The relatively low synaptic incidence of these varicosities
in Rt (39%) and DLG (33%) was all the more striking in
that many of the randomly selected unlabeled varicosities
in both nuclei, as well as in PF, presumably made more
than one synaptic junction. PF was the ﬁrst example of an
entirely synaptic ACh innervation in CNS. Such a difference in synaptic incidence of ACh axon varicosities among
thalamic nuclei remains to be explained. There is nothing
in the literature to suggest that the ACh innervation of PF
and DLG would have distinct neuronal origins. Indeed,
there is neuroanatomical evidence indicating that PPN
neurons innervate both PF and DLG (Hallanger et al.,
1987). Moreover, ACh neurons of the brainstem are presumably endowed with highly collateralized axons (Woolf

and Butcher, 1986; Pare´ et al., 1988; Steriade et al., 1988;
Bolton et al., 1993; Spreaﬁco et al., 1993) likely to innervate both thalamic nuclei. In addition to brainstem neurons, basal forebrain neurons also contribute to the ACh
innervation of Rt (Woolf and Butcher, 1986; Hallanger et
al., 1987; Levey et al., 1987; Jourdain et al., 1989), but no
such projection to PF or DLG has ever been demonstrated
in rat.
In the present study, we found no indication that a
vesicular glutamate transporter might be present in thalamic ACh axon terminals. Our double-labeling results
were consistent with an earlier report of Varoqui et al.
(2002), who did not ﬁnd colocalization of VGLUT2 protein
and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) in rat
brain. This did not exclude a transient expression of a
glutamate transporter during development, but refuted
the hypothesis that glutamate corelease might be involved
in the maintenance of the entirely synaptic ACh innervation in PF.

Functional considerations
It remains to be determined how the observed differences in distribution and ultrastructural features of the
ACh innervation among DLG, PF, and Rt might contribute to the diverse functions attributed to these thalamic
nuclei. The largely asynaptic character of many innervations in CNS has been viewed as morphological evidence
for the existence of diffuse transmission by such neuronal
systems, in addition to their synaptic function (reviewed
in Descarries and Mechawar, 2008). In the case of ACh, it
has also led to the suggestion of the existence of a low,
ambient level of neurotransmitter, the ﬂuctuations of
which could be implicated in the regulation of a variety of
physiological processes mediated by ACh and other transmitter receptors widely distributed on neuronal, glial, and
vascular elements (Descarries et al., 1997). Convincing
electrophysiological evidence for a regulatory role of ambient ACh has recently been obtained in dual unit recording studies of neostriatum (Narushima et al., 2007; Pakhotin and Bracci, 2007).
Autoradiographic ligand binding studies have demonstrated the existence of abundant nicotinic as well as
muscarinic receptor sites in the rat DLG, PF, and Rt
(Rotter et al., 1979; Wamsley et al., 1984; Cortes and
Palacios, 1986; Mash and Potter, 1986; Spencer et al.,
1986; Clarke, 1993). Subsequently, immunocytochemical
studies with speciﬁc antibodies have provided information
on the cellular location of different muscarinic receptor
subtypes in the rat DLG and Rt. In DLG, m1 and m3
receptor labeling was found on soma and dendrites of
thalamocortical cells, whereas m2 labeling was widespread on soma and dendrites of cells resembling geniculate, GABAergic interneurons (Plummer et al., 1999). In
Rt, which is entirely composed of GABAergic neurons, m2
labeling was also abundant (Plummer et al., 1999) and has
been described as predominating in distal dendrites and
also in the periphery of cell bodies (Oda et al., 2007),
where we never found a single synaptic ACh terminal.
Thus, in both nuclei, there may be muscarinic receptors
postsynaptic to ACh terminals, but a vast majority apparently reside in extrasynaptic locations, where these receptors must be reached by diffusion of ACh. In view of the
entirely synaptic ACh innervation of PF, it would be of
considerable interest to obtain similar data on muscarinic

receptor localization in that nucleus and then compare the
effects of ACh in PF to those in DLG and Rt.
According to currently available physiological data, two
different mechanisms are postulated to account for the
actions of ACh in rat DLG: 1) excitation of thalamocortical
neurons and 2) inhibition of DLG interneurons (GABAergic) and of the inhibitory (GABAergic) neurons of Rt that
project to other thalamic nuclei, including DLG. To what
extent these effects might depend on the synaptic vs. the
diffuse mode of transmission by ACh is currently unknown. In vitro physiology suggests that ACh depolarizes
thalamocortical cells through effects on both nicotinic and
muscarinic receptors, whereas its inhibitory effects on
GABAergic geniculate and reticular thalamic neurons
would be mediated primarily by muscarinic (m2) receptors. It is assumed that a key role of DLG in vision is to
modulate the character of incoming visual signals from
retinal ganglion cells en route to primary visual cortex as
a function of behavioral state (Singer, 1977; Sherman and
Koch, 1986; Steriade and Llinas, 1988; Sherman and
Guillery, 1996). The ACh input from the brainstem conveyed to DLG by diffuse as well as synaptic transmission
might contribute to this modulation. The maintenance of a
low level of ambient ACh in DLG could also play a crucial
role in keeping the thalamocortical neurons in the physiological state in which they will respond appropriately to
relevant stimuli. Similarly, in Rt, diffuse as well as synaptic ACh transmission could contribute to the maintenance of a majority of its GABAergic neurons in the hyperpolarized state, thus contributing to the disinhibition
of thalamocortical neurons located in other thalamic nuclei and to the faithful relay of relevant motor and sensory
information to the cerebral cortex during waking.
The intralaminar nuclei, including PF, have been considered as nonspeciﬁc thalamic nuclei more involved in
the “control of states of consciousness and perceptual
awareness” than in the cortical processing of speciﬁc information (Jasper, 1960; Van der Werf et al., 2002). This
general role is consistent with the ﬁnding that PF neurons
may innervate large expanses of the cerebral cortex as
well as focal areas of neostriatum in the rat and primate
(Jones and Leavitt, 1974; Van der Werf et al., 2002; Parent and Parent, 2005). As shown in the present study, PF
neurons receive a relatively dense and entirely synaptic
ACh input that should allow for the direct relaying of the
information from brainstem to both regions. For example,
after electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral PPN, half of
recorded neurons in rat PF responded by a short latency
orthodromic excitation that followed high-frequency stimulation over 300 Hz (Capozzo et al., 2003).
More speciﬁc functions have also been assigned to PF,
such as attentional orienting to external events, through
its thalamostriatal projection (Mancia and Marini, 1995;
Minamimoto and Kimura, 2002), and processing of the
affective dimension of pain (see, e.g. Harte et al., 2004),
presumably through its cortical projections. PF neurons
have also been shown to receive afferent projections from
output structures of the basal ganglia (van der Kooy and
Carter, 1981; Kha et al., 2000; Parent et al., 2001) and
have therefore been proposed to provide an important
subcortical feedback on striatal output through their
thalamostriatal projections (Nauta and Mehler, 1966;
Erro et al., 1999; Parent and Parent, 2005). Thus, the
direct, synaptic activation of PF neurons by the ACh input
from the brainstem during waking must affect basal gan-

glia function, as well as perceptual awareness, including
attention and pain perception. PPN has been shown to be
reciprocally connected with various basal ganglia components (see Winn, 2006). It is also in a position to affect this
set of subcortical structures by exerting a direct ACh
control on PF neuronal activity.

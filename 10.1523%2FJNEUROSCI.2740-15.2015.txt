Low-threshold Ca2ϩ spikes (LTS) are an indispensible signaling mechanism for neurons in areas including the cortex, cerebellum, basal
ganglia, and thalamus. They have critical physiological roles and have been strongly associated with disorders including epilepsy,
Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia. However, although dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ channels have been implicated in LTS generation,
because the properties of low-threshold spiking neuron dendrites are unknown, the precise mechanism has remained elusive.
Here, combining data from fluorescence-targeted dendritic recordings and Ca2ϩ imaging from low-threshold spiking cells in rat brain
slices with computational modeling, the cellular mechanism responsible for LTS generation is established. Our data demonstrate that key
somatodendritic electrical conduction properties are highly conserved between glutamatergic thalamocortical neurons and GABAergic
thalamic reticular nucleus neurons and that these properties are critical for LTS generation. In particular, the efficiency of soma to
dendrite voltage transfer is highly asymmetric in low-threshold spiking cells, and in the somatofugal direction, these neurons are
particularly electrotonically compact. Our data demonstrate that LTS have remarkably similar amplitudes and occur synchronously
throughout the dendritic tree. In fact, these Ca2ϩ spikes cannot occur locally in any part of the cell, and hence we reveal that LTS are
generated by a unique whole-cell mechanism that means they always occur as spatially global spikes. This all-or-none, global electrical
and biochemical signaling mechanism clearly distinguishes LTS from other signals, including backpropagating action potentials and
dendritic Ca2ϩ/NMDA spikes, and has important consequences for dendritic function in low-threshold spiking neurons.

Significance Statement
Low-threshold Ca2ϩ spikes (LTS) are critical for important physiological processes, including generation of sleep-related oscillations, and are implicated in disorders including epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia. However, the mechanism
underlying LTS generation in neurons, which is thought to involve dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ channels, has remained elusive due to a
lack of knowledge of the dendritic properties of low-threshold spiking cells. Combining dendritic recordings, two-photon Ca2ϩ
imaging, and computational modeling, this study reveals that dendritic properties are highly conserved between two prominent
low-threshold spiking neurons and that these properties underpin a whole-cell somatodendritic spike generation mechanism that
makes the LTS a unique global electrical and biochemical signal in neurons.

and Eccles (1962), a feature they termed “postanodal exhaltation.” Subsequently, after detailed characterization (Descheˆnes et
al., 1984; Jahnsen and Llina´s, 1984a,b), the underlying phenomenon has become known as the “low-threshold spike” (LTS) and
has been described in cells including subthalamic neurons (Nakanishi et al., 1987), cortical (Goldberg et al., 2004) and striatal
(Kawaguchi, 1993) interneurons, serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons (Burlhis and Aghajanian, 1987), neurons of the inferior olivary nucleus (Llina´s and Yarom, 1981a), and deep cerebellar
nucleus neurons (Llina´s and Mu¨hlethaler, 1988).
Nevertheless, LTS are most prominent in glutamatergic
thalamocortical (TC) neurons and GABAergic neurons of the
thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) where they are essential for
normal thalamic function. LTS play an indispensable role in
rhythmic sleep-related activity including delta waves (Steriade et
al., 1991), slow (Ͻ1 Hz) oscillations (Steriade et al., 1993; Hughes
et al., 2002; Blethyn et al., 2006), and 7–14 Hz sleep spindles
(Contreras and Steriade, 1996) and also mediate an attentiondependent thalamic “wake-up” signal to the cortex during wakefulness (Swadlow and Gusev, 2001). Moreover, LTS have been
implicated in several serious pathological conditions including
epilepsy (Pinault et al., 1998), Parkinson’s disease (Magnin et al.,
2000), and schizophrenia (Ferrarelli et al., 2010).
Recently, Ca2ϩ imaging studies in TC (Errington et al., 2010,
2012; Sieber et al., 2013) and TRN (Crandall et al., 2010;
Chausson et al., 2013) neurons demonstrated that LTS are associated with widespread dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ channeldependent Ca2ϩ influx. Consistent with computational studies
(Destexhe et al., 1998; Zomorrodi et al., 2008), these findings
imply a central role for dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ channels in LTS
generation. However, these data do not explain how the LTS is
generated. In fact, three plausible, but distinct, models could be
reasoned to explain these results. First, like Na ϩ-mediated action
potentials (Stuart et al., 1997), LTS might originate in the axosomatic region and activate dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ channels by
active or passive dendritic backpropagation. This mechanism was
originally favored for LTS by Llina´s and Yarom (1981b) in inferior olivary neurons. Second, like dendritic Ca2ϩ (Schiller et al.,
1997) or NMDA (Schiller et al., 2000) spikes, LTS might be locally
triggered in dendrites by activation of high-density T-type Ca2ϩ
channels before propagating throughout the cell. Third, the electrotonic properties of low-threshold (LT)-spiking neurons mean
that, although they are widely distributed in space, T-type Ca2ϩ
channels can be simultaneously activated throughout the somatodendritic tree to generate a unique “global spike,” a mechanism
suggested for TC neurons in a computational modeling study
by Neubig and Sejnowski (2000). Since each has different implications for dendritic signaling in LT-spiking neurons, understanding which mechanism underlies LTS generation is
critical. However, to test these hypotheses, knowledge of the
dendritic properties of LT-spiking neurons is required, and,
unfortunately, this is almost completely absent from our current understanding.
Here, using dual somatodendritic recordings, Ca2ϩ imaging,
and computational modeling, we demonstrate that despite differences in morphology and functional roles, TC and TRN neurons have highly conserved dendritic electrical properties. We
find that these properties, including highly asymmetric somatodendritic voltage transfer, underpin simultaneous recruitment of
spatially distributed T-type Ca2ϩ channels that act in concert to
generate a distinctive global Ca2ϩ spike. This unique mechanism,
which we predict is shared by all LT-spiking cells, sets the LTS
apart from other dendritic electrical and biochemical signals and

has important consequences for synaptic signaling, integration
and plasticity.

Materials and Methods
Electrophysiology. Coronal slices (250 –300 ␮m) containing the dorsal
lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and horizontal slices containing the
TRN were prepared from postnatal day 20 –25 (P20 –P25; dLGN) and
P17–P21 (TRN) Wistar rats of either sex, which were deeply anesthetized
using isoflurane, as described by Errington et al. (2010) and with approval of the Cardiff University Research Ethics Committee and in accordance with the Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act
1986, United Kingdom. For recording, slices were transferred to a submersion chamber continuously perfused with warmed (33– 4°C) aCSF
[in mM: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25
NaHCO3, and 25 D-glucose (305 mOsm)] at a flow rate of 2.5–3 ml/min.
Somatic whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from TC and
TRN neurons (visually identified by infrared gradient contrast video
microscopy) using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices)
and pipettes with resistances of 4 – 6 M⍀ when filled with an internal
solution containing (in mM) 130 K-gluconate, 20 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.16
EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 2 Na2-ATP, and 0.3 Na2-GTP, pH 7.3 (295 mOsm),
and supplemented with 50 ␮M Alexa 594 (Invitrogen). Recording solutions did not routinely include any synaptic blocking drugs or other
blocking toxins unless specifically indicated. Electrophysiological data
were sampled at 20 –50 kHz and filtered at 6 kHz. Somatic series resistance at the start of experiments was between 9 and 15 M⍀ and varied
Յ20% during recordings. Two-photon fluorescence microscopy, using a
Prairie Ultima (Prairie Technologies) microscope and titanium/sapphire
pulsed laser (Chameleon Ultra II; Coherent) tuned to ␭ ϭ 810 nm, was
combined with infrared scanning gradient contrast to make targeted
dendritic patch-clamp recordings from thin (ϳ0.7–2 ␮m) dendrites of
TC (see Fig. 2A) and TRN (see Fig. 3A) neurons. Dendritic recording
pipettes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (BF200-100-10;
Sutter Instruments) and had resistances of 25– 40 M⍀ when filled with
the internal recording solution described above. This resulted in recordings that had high series resistance values (TC: 60 –105 M⍀, 79.6 Ϯ 1.8
M⍀, n ϭ 28; TRN: 35–71 M⍀, 53.5 Ϯ 2.0 M⍀, n ϭ 20). However, series
resistance of dendritic recordings was not correlated with distance of the
recording site from the soma in either TC (n ϭ 28, r ϭ 0.07, p ϭ 0.70,
Pearson’s r test; Fig. 1E) or TRN (n ϭ 20, r ϭ 0.22, p ϭ 0.36, Pearson’s r
test; Fig. 1F ) neurons. Nonetheless, since the recording pipette behaves
as a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency inversely to proportional to its
resistance (Rp) and capacitance (Cp), it is critical that careful compensation is performed so that high-frequency dendritic voltages are minimally distorted. Thus, dendritic and somatic bridge balance and pipette
capacitance neutralization were carefully adjusted and monitored
throughout experiments by application of low-frequency (50 Hz), lowamplitude current steps (10 – 40 pA). Importantly, in our recordings,
although the low capacitance and high input resistance of the dendrites
resulted in large and rapid dendritic voltage responses, these were considerably slower than the near instantaneous voltage drop observed with
an “unbalanced bridge.” Nonetheless, absolutely “perfect” bridge balance may not have been achieved in each recording. However, potential
small errors in bridge balance settings cannot account for the dendritic
voltage responses and input resistances we measure (see Results). We
tested the ability of high-resistance electrodes to record membrane potential transients by performing dual somatic recordings from TC neurons with high-resistance (RS: 69.4 Ϯ 5.3 M⍀, n ϭ 3) and low-resistance
(RS: 10.3 Ϯ 0.7 M⍀, n ϭ 3; Fig. 1A–C) electrodes. We found no significant ( p Ͼ 0.49, paired t test) difference in the amplitude of action potentials recorded by high-resistance electrodes versus low-resistance
electrodes (Fig. 1 B, C), consistent with previous findings (Nevian et al.,
2007; Bathellier et al., 2009; Larkum et al., 2009; Krueppel et al., 2011).
Thus, we conclude that compensation can be performed accurately even
for high-resistance electrodes and that the dendritic voltages we report
are accurate.
Measurement of steady-state electrotonic parameters. To measure the
steady-state voltage and current transfer properties of dendrites, long
current injection steps were used (500 –1000 ms). Current was injected at

either the somatic or dendritic recording electrode resulting in four possible voltage measurements, namely the voltage at the soma with somatic
injection (VSS), voltage at the dendrite with somatic injection (VDS),
voltage at the soma with dendritic injection (VSD), and voltage at the
dendrite with dendritic injection (VDD). Local somatic and dendritic
input resistance (RN) was measured by dividing the average (over 50 ms)
local voltage response at the end of the step by the injected current (RN
soma ϭ VSS/IS and RN dendrite ϭ VDD/ID). The transfer resistance (RC)

was measured by dividing the voltage response at the noncurrent injecting electrode by the current injected at the reciprocal electrode (RC ϭ
VSD/ID or VDS/IS). Steady-state voltage transfer between soma and dendrites (VSS¡VDS) was defined by VDS/VSS and between dendrites and
soma (VDD¡VSD) by VSD/VDD. Current transmission was calculated as
the ratio of current arriving at the soma to the current injected into the
dendrite. According to Ohm’s law, the current arriving at the soma is
equal to the somatic voltage response to current injected in the dendrite

divided by the somatic RN. Therefore, the current transmitted to the
soma is IS ϭ VSD/RN ϭ VSD/VSS. To quantify the relationship between
measured values (e.g., steady-state voltage attenuation) and the distance
between the dendritic and somatic recording electrodes, data were fit
with a mono-exponential function, f(x) ϭ exp(Ϫx/␭eff), to yield the
“effective space constant” ␭eff. Approximations of the electrotonic
lengths ( L) of TC and TRN neuron dendrites were calculated based on
the space constant (␭eff) derived from decaying exponential fits to our
dendritic recording data (L ϭ physical dendritic length/␭eff). Estimates
of the mean physical lengths of TC (160 ␮m) and TRN (400 ␮m) neuron
dendrites were based on previous detailed anatomical measurements
made by Ohara and Havton (1994; TC), Spreafico et al. (1991; TRN), and
Lu¨bke (1993; TRN).
Low-threshold spikes were evoked by injection of depolarizing (40 –
120 pA) and/or hyperpolarizing (Ϫ80 to Ϫ200 pA) current steps (1 s
duration) into the somatic and dendritic recording electrodes in TC and
TRN neurons held at their resting membrane potential. In TC neurons,
rebound bursts were evoked by hyperpolarizing the soma from the resting membrane potential to Ϫ82.5 Ϯ 1.5 mV (n ϭ 28). In TRN, cells were
held at Ϫ55 mV and hyperpolarized to Ϫ70.3 Ϯ 1.4 mV (n ϭ 20). For TC
neurons, the peak amplitude was measured as the difference between the
peak of the Ca2ϩ spike component of the LTS and the resting membrane
potential immediately before LTS were evoked (see Fig. 6A). In TRN
neurons, all quantitative data are derived from measuring the peak of the
Ca 2ϩ-spike component of the LTS in TTX (0.5 ␮M) and the resting
membrane potential. Although we evoked LTS using both hyperpolarizing (from rest in TC neurons and from Ϫ55 mV in TRN neurons) and
depolarizing current steps, quantitative data are derived only from depolarizing currents. LTS threshold was determined as the point at which
the first derivate (␦V/␦t) of the membrane potential resulting from
the minimum depolarizing current step required to generate an LTS
exceeded 0.5 mV ⅐ ms Ϫ1.
Frequency-dependent impedance. Impedance (Z) was obtained by injecting a sinusoidal frequency-modulated current (ICHIRP) of linearly
increasing frequency (0.1–20 Hz) and 10 s duration into either the
somatic or dendritic recording pipette. ICHIRP was calculated by the
following:

I CHIRP ϭ

(1)

where A is the peak-to-peak amplitude, fmax is the peak frequency
reached at time tmax, and t is time (starting at zero). Fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) of the time domain current and voltage traces produced
complex numbers comprising real, Re( f ), and imaginary, Im( f ), parts
that represent the signal in the frequency domain. Subsequently, the
impedance magnitude was calculated by the following:

͉Z͑ f ͉͒ ϭ

ͱ͑ Re(Z͑ f ͒͒2 ϩ Im͑Z͑ f ͒͒2)

(2)

and the impedance phase (in radians) was calculated by the following:

␾ ͑ f ͒ ϭ tanϪ1

Im͑Z͑ f ͒͒
Re͑Z͑ f ͒͒

(3)

Somatic and/or dendritic input impedance amplitude profiles (ZAPN)
were calculated by dividing the magnitude of the local voltage response
[Z( f)local voltage] by the magnitude of the local current injection [ZAPN ϭ
Z( f)local voltage/Z( f)local current]. The amplitude of ICHIRP (Ϯ20 pA) was adjusted to keep voltage responses below the threshold for LTS initiation, and
the lowest frequency analyzed was 0.5 Hz to avoid boundary artifacts of the
FFT (spectral resolution, 0.15 Hz). Transfer impedance amplitude profiles
(ZAPC) were calculated by injecting ICHIRP into the somatic or dendritic
recording electrode and recording the voltage response at the reciprocal
electrode (Vreciprocal). Thus, ZAPC ϭ Z( f)reciprocal voltage/Z( f)local current.
Input impedance phase profiles (ZPPN) were calculated as the algebraic difference between the phase of the local voltage response [⌽( f)local voltage] and
the local current input [⌽( f)local current]. Transfer impedance phase profiles
(ZPPC) were calculated as the algebraic difference between phase of the local
injected current [⌽( f)local current] and the phase of the voltage at the recip-

rocal electrode [⌽( f)reciprocal voltage]. All voltages represent averages of five
trials.
Somatic ZAPN were fit with a single-pole resistance and capacitance

Two-photon Ca2ϩ imaging. Two-photon Ca2ϩ imaging and focal
TTA-P2 application were performed using a Prairie Ultima microscope
(Prairie Technologies) and titanium/sapphire pulsed laser (Chameleon
Ultra II; Coherent) tuned to ␭ ϭ 810 nm as previously described in detail
by Errington et al. (2010). Briefly, the internal patch pipette solution,
described above, was supplemented with the red Ca2ϩ-insensitive dye
Alexa Fluor 594 (25 ␮M) and the green Ca2ϩ indicator Fluo 5F (300 ␮M),
and cells were allowed to fill for 20 min before commencing experiments.
Line scans were performed at 500 Hz (2 ms per line) at selected dendritic
regions of interest, and the ratio of green over red fluorescence (⌬G/R)
was measured as the stimulus-evoked change in intracellular Ca2ϩ.
Computational modeling. Simulations were performed using
NEURON 7.2 (Carnevale and Hines, 2006). A morphologically accurate
model cell was taken from the study by Briska et al. (2003). Briefly, they
prepared brain slices (500 ␮m) from adult Sprague Dawley rats (100 –300
g), and a biocytin-filled TC neuron from the dLGN was reconstructed
using the Neurolucida system (see Fig. 9A). This was subsequently used
to produce a multicompartmental NEURON model comprising 196 sections with a total of 684 segments. We obtained passive biophysical properties by fitting the model cell to the parameters that gave the best fit to
our somatic and dendritic recordings using the principal axis method
(PRAXIS). Initially, axial resistance (Ri) and specific membrane capacitance (Cm), along with a rough approximation of membrane conductance, were estimated using purely passive conditions. Fits were made to
somatic and dendritic voltage transients obtained during dual physiological recordings in response to 3 ms, Ϫ100 pA current injections steps.
This approach yielded best-fit estimates for Ri of 170 ⍀ ⅐ cm and for Cm
of 0.7 ␮F/cm 2. Leak conductance ( gLEAK) and hyperpolarizationactivated cyclic nucleotide-gated conductance (H-current, gH) were then
estimated by fitting the model to voltages evoked by longer 500 ms current steps of Ϫ40 pA. Several different models of gH were tested, but our
recordings were best described by the rate of gH activation in the model
proposed by McCormick and Pape (1990). Fitting was attempted with
linear variation of the density of these conductances along the somatodendritic axis. The data were, however, found to be best fit with an
invariant channel density, a finding that is consistent with previous in
vitro findings (Williams and Stuart, 2000). Several models of T-type Ca2ϩ
channels were investigated, and the best fit to our data was obtained using
the model proposed by Destexhe et al. (1998). The gating of the T-type
Ca2ϩ channel was shifted by 12 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction. This
was necessary to account for differences in recording conditions between
our study, where a liquid junction potential of 12 mV was not corrected
for, and the study by Huguenard and Prince (1992), which obtained the
experimental data used by the model of Destexhe et al. (1998). Variations
in somatodendritic T-type conductance distribution were tested. When
channels were restricted to the soma and/or proximal dendrites, the
intracellular dendritic calcium transients (⌬Ca2ϩ) previously reported
(Crandall et al., 2010; Errington et al., 2010, 2012; Sieber et al., 2013)
could not be reproduced. However, using a uniform somatodendritic
channel density distribution produced the best fit to electrophysiological
recordings as well as producing the roughly uniform ⌬Ca2ϩ described in
our previous study. To describe intracellular Ca2ϩ accumulation and
removal, a simple Ca2ϩ extrusion mechanism was inserted. This model
was described by McCormick and Huguenard (1992) and had first-order

Connelly et al. • The Global Low-Threshold Spike

kinetics leading to extrusion of Ca2ϩ to a final resting concentration of
200 nM, with a time constant of 5 ms. A Ca2ϩ-activated cation channel
( gCAN) was included in our model using values calculated by Destexhe et
al. (1994). Fast voltage-gated sodium channels ( gNa) were included from
the study by Destexhe et al. (1998). Finally, an inwardly rectifying potassium channel ( gKIR) was required to accurately reproduce the steadystate I–V behavior observed during dual recordings. The model used is
described by Williams et al. (1997), although we found that a shift of 15
mV in the depolarizing direction was required to allow the model to
match our electrophysiological data. Once the necessary channels were
inserted into the model, we recalculated gLEAK, by fitting to electrophysiological data, to account for their conductance at rest.
Thus, our final model comprised the following: gLEAK was modeled
with a reversal potential of Ϫ79 mV and conductance of 150 ␮s/cm 2, and
gH had a reversal potential of Ϫ45 mV and peak conductance of 150
␮s/cm 2. T-type Ca2ϩ channels ( gT) were modeled with a reversal potential of 120 mV and a permeability of 0.7 ␮m/s. The gCAN had a conductance of 250 ␮S/cm 2 and reversal potential of Ϫ20 mV. The gKIR and the
fast voltage-gated potassium channel ( gKf) had conductances of 20 ␮s/
cm 2 and 50 mS/cm 2, respectively. Both potassium channels had reversal
potentials of Ϫ100 mV. The gNa had conductance of 50 mS/cm 2 and
reversal potential of 50 mV. Throughout this manuscript, when referring
to the ability of gT to provide current, we use the term “conductance”
rather than “permeability.” Whereas the model is in actuality based on
permeability rather than conductance, we use this naming convention to
simplify the text.
Simulations were solved with a fixed time step of 50 ␮s or using the
implicit variable time-step solver CVODE, depending on the nature of
the simulation (Cohen and Hindmarsh, 1996). Dendrites used for simulations were selected based on their morphology. In most model dendrites, overall dendritic lengths were very similar. In comparison, the
length of the primary dendrites varied, and thus the higher-order thin
dendrites also had different dendritic path lengths. Primary dendrites,
because of their relatively large diameter, added little axial resistance, and
thus distal dendrites arising from longer first-order dendrites had lower
input resistance than those arising from shorter primary dendrites. Thus,
we selected four dendrites with input resistance profiles that encompassed the range we found in our experiments (see Fig. 9A).
Data analysis and statistics. Data analysis was performed using pClamp
10 (Molecular Devices), Matlab (Mathworks), ImageJ (NIH), and Prism
(GraphPad Software) software. Distance measurements were performed on
image stacks collected at the end of recordings using MetaMorph (Molecular
Devices) as described by Errington et al. (2010). Statistical testing was by
paired/unpaired t test, repeated-measures ANOVA, or Pearson’s r test where
appropriate. Space constants were derived from exponential fits to the experimental data. All values are given as mean Ϯ SEM.

Results
Conserved steady-state electrical properties between TC and
TRN neuron dendrites
Previous studies indicate that the majority of T-type Ca2ϩ channels responsible for generating LTS in LT-spiking neurons are
found in their dendrites (Destexhe et al., 1998; Williams and
Stuart, 2000; Crandall et al., 2010; Errington et al., 2010). Therefore, to investigate the mechanism underlying LTS generation,
we first characterized the basic electrotonic properties of LTspiking cells that, unlike those of other cell types, remain almost
wholly unknown. We combined two-photon fluorescence with

length of TRN neuron dendrites (range, 35–200 ␮m; mean distance, 105.4 Ϯ 11.12 ␮m; n ϭ 20; Fig. 3A). In our recordings, we
observed a small, distance-dependent dendritic resting membrane potential depolarization relative to the soma in both TC

p ϭ 0.039, Pearson’s r test; Fig. 1F ) neurons. In both cell types,
the mean dendritic resting membrane potential was significantly
more depolarized than at the soma (TC: S, Ϫ73.8 Ϯ 1.2 mV; D,
Ϫ71.3 Ϯ 1.1 mV; n ϭ 20; p ϭ 0.0019, paired t test; Fig. 3C; TRN:
S, Ϫ69.4 Ϯ 0.6 mV; D, Ϫ65.5 Ϯ 0.5 mV; n ϭ 35; p Ͻ 0.0001,
paired t test; Fig. 2B).
We tested the steady-state (DC) electrical conduction properties of these neurons using long, stepwise current injections. At
rest, somatic current injection produced somatic voltage responses (VSS) typical of TC (Fig. 2B) and TRN (Fig. 3B) neurons,
having prominent LTS. In both neurons, the concurrent dendritic voltage responses (VDS) were strikingly similar to VSS [TC
(Fig. 2B), TRN (Fig. 3B)] regardless of the dendritic recording
location. In contrast, dendritic current injection produced VDD
that were increasingly larger than VSD as the dendritic recording
site became more distal [TC (Fig. 2C), TRN (Fig. 3C)]. Steadystate voltage transfer was evaluated by comparing somatic and
dendritic voltage responses produced by Ϫ40 pA hyperpolarizing
current steps. Somatic current injections revealed highly efficient
steady-state voltage transfer between soma and dendrites
(VSS¡VDS) in both TC (range, 0.69 –1.01; 0.88 Ϯ 0.01; n ϭ 35;
Fig. 2E) and TRN (range, 0.83–1.04; 0.93 Ϯ 0.01; n ϭ 20; Fig. 3D)
neurons. Fitting decaying exponential functions to the data
yielded effective space constants of ␭eff ϭ 654 ␮m (TC; Fig. 2E)
and ␭eff ϭ 1521 ␮m (TRN; Fig. 3D). Using previous measurements of dendritic length (Spreafico et al., 1991; Ohara and Havton, 1994; Lu¨bke, 1993), we estimated the electrotonic length of
these dendrites. In the somatofugal direction, both TC (L Ϸ 0.24)
and TRN (L Ϸ 0.26) neurons have similar short electrotonic
lengths and are, therefore, very electrotonically compact. In clear
comparison, steady-state voltage transfer between dendrites and
soma (VDD¡VSD) was much less efficient in TC (0.15–1.05,
0.45 Ϯ 0.05, ␭eff ϭ 69 ␮m, L Ϸ 2.3, n ϭ 35; Fig. 2E) and TRN
(0.09 – 0.75, 0.38 Ϯ 0.04, ␭eff ϭ 98 ␮m, L Ϸ 4.1, n ϭ 20; Fig. 3D)
neurons. Interestingly, asymmetry between (VSS¡VDS) and
VDD¡VSD was remarkably similar in both neurons despite their
differing dendritic morphology. Such asymmetry is consistent
with cable theory of branching neurons and is attributable to
imbalances in impedance load encountered by current flowing in
opposing directions along the dendritic cable as a result of the
significantly different boundary conditions imposed by the
soma/proximal dendrites and sealed terminal ends of the dendrite (Rall and Rinzel, 1973; Carnevale et al., 1997; Jaffe and
Carnevale, 1999). Consistent with this concept, dendritic input
resistance (RN) increased markedly in both TC (156.6 M⍀ at 25
␮m to 1.1 G⍀ at 114 ␮m; 537.5 Ϯ 41.0 M⍀, n ϭ 35; Fig. 2F ) and
TRN (157 M⍀ at 35 ␮m to 1.03 G⍀ at 183 ␮m; 388.8 Ϯ 46.2 M⍀,
n ϭ 20; Fig. 3E) neurons as a function of distance from the soma
(TC somatic RN: 102.9 – 450.3 M⍀, 197.6 Ϯ 11.4 M⍀, n ϭ 35; Fig.
2F; TRN somatic RN: 80.0 to 221.3 M⍀, 131.0 Ϯ 8.4 M⍀, n ϭ 20;
Fig. 3E). In TC neurons, these experimentally measured RN values are consistent with those previously predicted by computational modeling studies (Lajeunesse et al., 2013). Significantly,
however, in both types of LT-spiking neurons, unlike steady-state
voltage transfer between dendrite and soma, current transmission, calculated as the ratio of current arriving at the soma to that
injected into the dendrite, was highly efficient (TC: ␭eff ϭ 614
␮m, n ϭ 35; Fig. 2I; TRN: ␭eff ϭ 1519 ␮m, n ϭ 20; Fig. 3H;
Carnevale and Johnston, 1982). Consequently, the majority of
current injected into the dendrite flows along the axial path toward the soma, meaning the observed dendrite to soma voltage
attenuation is caused by large differences in local dendritic and

somatic RN rather than substantial current loss through a “leaky”
dendritic tree.
In dendrites of both LT-spiking neurons, VSD and VDS were
nearly identical (“reciprocity”), indicating linear behavior at subthreshold voltages (Koch, 1984). Linear fits of VSD versus VDS
revealed slopes of 1.06 Ϯ 0.03 in TC (n ϭ 35; Fig. 2H ) and 1.01 Ϯ
0.02 in TRN (n ϭ 20; Fig. 3G) neurons. Consequently, electrical
conduction between soma and dendrites is well described by a
linear two-port circuit model (Carnevale and Johnston, 1982;
Jaffe and Carnevale, 1999). Briefly, two-port electrotonic theory
proposes that electrical coupling between any two points in a
linear system, i.e., the dendrite and soma, can be described by an
equivalent circuit consisting of three impedances (or resistances
in the DC case), two axial impedances, and a common transfer
impedance (ZC; Fig. 2D; Jaffe and Carnevale, 1999). This model
predicts that in neurons displaying steep somatodendritic gradi-

ents of RN, as described above for TC (Fig. 2F ) and TRN (Fig. 3E)
neurons, to account for the observed VDD¡VSD voltage attenuation, transfer resistance (RC) will vary little with distance from
the soma (Jaffe and Carnevale, 1999). This is precisely what we
observed in our somatodendritic recordings [TC (Fig. 2G), TRN
(Fig. 3F )]. Moreover, as predicted for a linear system, measured
RC values were equal whether calculated from somatic (VDS) or
dendritic (VSD) current injections in both TC (VDS RC, 165.2 Ϯ
7.8 M⍀; VSD RC, 177.3 Ϯ 8.9 M⍀; n ϭ 35, p ϭ 0.07, paired t test;
Fig. 2G) and TRN (VDS RC, 122.2 Ϯ 7.8 M⍀; VSD RC, 122.7 Ϯ 8.9
M⍀; n ϭ 20, p ϭ 0.85, paired t test; Fig. 3F ) neurons. This
distance-dependent profile of Rc in LT-spiking neurons demonstrates that currents of equal size entering any location within
the dendritic tree will be almost equally efficient in depolarizing
the soma and produce similar changes in somatic voltage. The
steady-state electrical conduction properties of both TC and TRN

dendrites were similar when the neurons were depolarized
(Ϫ55 mV) as they were at rest (Table 1). Thus, despite having
very different dendritic morphologies, the steady-state electrotonic properties of TC and TRN neurons are remarkably similar.
Frequency-dependent impedance properties of
LT-spiking neurons
So far, we have examined the electrical properties of TC and TRN
neuron dendrites under steady-state (DC) conditions. Of course,
neuronal signals including LTS are dynamic and time-varying
signals, and TC and TRN neurons are known to reside in active
oscillating circuits. Electrical impedance is the ratio of the recorded voltage response to an injected current and is a standard

measurement for characterizing frequency-dependent neuronal
membrane properties. Impedance is a complex quantity having a
real part, the resistance, and an imaginary part, the reactance.
Whereas resistance ( R) is always a positive value, reactance can be
either a positive or negative value depending on the presence of
capacitive ( C) or inductive ( L) elements within the circuit
(Narayanan and Johnston, 2008). The phase relationship between injected current and recorded voltage is a measure of reactance and can be used to determine the presence and function of
inductive elements within neurons. Therefore, we tested
frequency-dependent properties by injecting sinusoidal
frequency-modulated currents (ICHIRP, 0.1–20 Hz, Ϯ20 pA,
10 s) into the soma (ICHIRPS) and dendrites (ICHIRPD) of these

two types of LT-spiking neurons [TC (Fig. 4 A, B), TRN (Fig.
5 A, B)].
First, using the discrete Fourier transforms of the somatic
(VCHIRPS) and dendritic (VCHIRPD) voltage responses, we calculated the input (ZAPN) and transfer (ZAPC) impedance amplitude profiles. Injection of ICHIRPS revealed frequency-dependent
attenuation of local input impedance (ZN) in TC (1 Hz, 211.3 Ϯ
20.1 M⍀; 20 Hz, 51.2 Ϯ 3.2 M⍀; n ϭ 9, p Ͻ 0.0001, paired t test;
Fig. 4 A, C) and TRN (1 Hz, 129.3 Ϯ 10.6 M⍀; 20 Hz, 71.6 Ϯ 6.2
M⍀; n ϭ 14, p Ͻ 0.0001, paired t test; Fig. 5 A, C) neurons. In our
recordings, we did not observe strong membrane potential resonance, and somatic ZAPN in both LT-spiking cells displayed lowpass filter characteristics and could be fit by an RC function.
These fits revealed cutoff frequencies ( fC) of 4.9 Ϯ 0.5 and 12.9 Ϯ
0.5 Hz and time constants of 35.0 Ϯ 3.9 and 12.6 Ϯ 0.4 ms in TC
(n ϭ 9; Fig. 4C) and TRN (n ϭ 14; Fig. 5C) neurons, respectively.
In contrast to the soma, and in line with steady-state RN, the
magnitude of dendritic ZAPN in both TC (1 Hz, 524.40 Ϯ 65.76
M⍀; 20 Hz, 341.6 Ϯ 66.41 M⍀; n ϭ 9, p Ͻ 0.0001, paired t test;
Fig. 4 B, D,G) and TRN (1 Hz, 547.8 Ϯ 70.7 M⍀; 20 Hz, 405.0 Ϯ
48.5 M⍀; n ϭ 16, p Ͻ 0.0001, paired t test; Fig. 5 B, D,G) neurons
was dependent on the distance of the recording location from the
soma and was also frequency dependent. Dendritic ZAPN could
not, however, be fit by the same RC function as somatic ZAPN,
indicating substantially different dendritic filtering properties.
Thus, across a range of frequencies, the distance-dependent somatic and dendritic input impedance profiles matched those observed with DC inputs and were remarkably similar between TC
and TRN neurons.
To test whether somatodendritic conduction of non-DC signals in LT-spiking neurons was linear, we calculated ZAPC by
dividing the magnitude of voltage response at one recording electrode by that of ICHIRP at the other. In both types of LT-spiking
cells, ZAPC decreased with increasing signal frequency and, similar to the DC case, was equal in both S¡D and D¡S directions
at all frequencies tested [TC (Fig. 4E–G), TRN (Fig. 5E–G)]. This
can be observed by comparing VCHIRPD evoked by ICHIRPS [TC
(Fig. 4A), TRN (Fig. 5A, red trace)] with VCHIRPS evoked by
ICHIRPD [TC (Fig. 4B), TRN (Fig. 5B, blue trace)]. These data
demonstrate that somatodendritic conduction of low-frequency
(Ͻ20 Hz) signals in LT-spiking neurons can be described by a
linear model. Furthermore, these findings demonstrate that
across a range of input frequencies, the relationship between
ZAPN, ZAPC, and distance from the soma remains constant, and
both TC and TRN neurons have distance-dependent dendritic

gradients of ZN but nearly spatial uniformity of ZC [TC (Fig. 4G),
TRN (Fig. 5G)]. As a consequence, these properties result in
strongly asymmetric voltage transfer in the S¡D and D¡S direction in both TC (Fig. 4I ) and TRN (Fig. 5I ). In particular, in
the S¡D direction, voltage attenuation is very low and insensitive to input frequency, meaning that current transmission between D¡S remains highly efficient. Accordingly, voltage
changes at the soma of LT-spiking neurons are transferred
throughout the entire dendritic tree with little reduction in amplitude. This has important consequences for the activation of
dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ channels during LTS (discussed below).
We also investigated phase properties by calculating the input
(ZPPN) and transfer (ZPPC) impedance phase profiles. First, as
can be seen from ZPPN, at all frequencies in both TC (Fig.
4C, D, H ) and TRN (Fig. 5C, D, H ) neurons, VCHIRPS and
VCHIRPD always lagged injected current. Together with the lack of
a resonance peak in ZAPN, these data suggest that LT-spiking
neurons have the properties of a simple low-pass RC electrical circuit. However, both TC and TRN neurons express
hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels
(HCN; IH) that are strongly linked to the emergence of resonance
and bandpass-filtering properties (Hutcheon and Yarom, 2000).
Indeed, some neurons that express IH are best modeled not as RC
circuits but as RCL circuits (Narayanan and Johnston, 2008;
Vaidya and Johnston, 2013). Resonance and bandpass filtering
emerges through the interaction between passive and active
properties of neurons with resistance ( R) and capacitance ( C)
acting to passively low-pass (RC) filter signals ( fc ϭ 1/2␲RC),
whereas the inductive conductance ( L) acts as a high-pass (RL)
filter ( fc ϭ 1/2␲␶L, where ␶L equals the channel activation time
constant; Hutcheon and Yarom, 2000). In both TC and TRN
neurons, as well as other LT-spiking cells including subthalamic
neurons and deep cerebellar nucleus neurons, the predominantly
expressed channel isoform is HCN-2, which has slow activation
kinetics at typical resting membrane potentials. As a consequence, fc for the high-pass RL filter in these neurons at rest (Ϫ70
mV) is very low (ϳ0.15 Hz), and thus we see a general broadband
suppression of low frequencies up to the low-pass cutoff frequency rather than a sharp resonant-type bandpass profile in the
ZAP.
For ICHIRPS, ZPPN was frequency dependent in both TC (Fig.
4C) and TRN (Fig. 5C) neurons, having minimal phase lag at
frequencies Ͻ2 Hz (less than Ϫ1/12␲ rad) but phase differences
of more than Ϫ1/3␲ radians with 20 Hz input. This corresponds
to a time delay of 8 –10 ms between the somatic current and
voltage (20 Hz). In comparison, although ZPPN for ICHIRPD were
also frequency dependent, the phase lag of voltage responses to
current input at 20 Hz was significantly less [less than Ϫ1/6␲
rads, 2.5–3 ms; TC (Fig. 4D), TRN (Fig. 5D)]. Interestingly, dendritic ZPPN showed little change with increasing distance from
the soma in both TC (Fig. 4G) and TRN (Fig. 5G) neurons, indicating that dendritic voltage phase is dictated by local, mostly
invariant, membrane properties. Similarly to ZAPC, ZPPC calculated as the difference in phase between the local voltage response
and current injected at the reciprocal recording site, was frequency dependent and equal in both the S¡D and D¡S direction for TC (Fig. 4E–H ) and TRN (Fig. 5E–H ) cells. ZPPC was
mostly insensitive to the distance between the voltage recording
and current injecting site [TC (Fig. 4G), TRN (Fig. 5G)]. Thus, in
the S¡D direction, VCHIRPD is almost equally phase lagged to
ICHIRPS at dendritic recording locations, and in the D¡S direction, VCHIRPS are equally in phase with ICHIRPD regardless of the
dendritic input location. This “phase reciprocity” is evident in

Figure 4H (TC) and Figure 5H (TRN) when comparing VCHIRPD
(top, red trace) evoked by ICHIRPS with VCHIRPS (bottom, blue
trace) evoked by ICHIRPD. As for voltage transfer, these findings
demonstrate that phase between somatic and dendritic voltages is
highly directionally asymmetric. Thus, in the S¡D direction,
phase lag between VCHIRPS and VCHIRPD is minimal at all
frequencies when evoked by ICHIRPS in LT-spiking neurons. In
comparison, in response to ICHIRPD, we see a significant
frequency-dependent phase lag between VCHIRPS and VCHIRPD
[TC (Fig. 4J ), TRN (Fig. 5J )]. In summary, these data reveal
almost identical somatodendritic transmission properties in two
different classes of LT-spiking neurons. Transmission of signals
from S¡D and D¡S is highly asymmetric. Thus, current input
to the soma, across a range of frequencies, produces voltage
changes that are efficiently transmitted throughout the whole
dendritic tree with minimal amplitude attenuation and phase
shift. Conversely, current input to dendrites produces voltage
responses that undergo strong attenuation and have significant
phase shifts between the dendrite and soma. As we describe below, these highly conserved dendritic properties are critical in
enabling LTS in both TC and TRN neurons.
Low-threshold spikes cannot be locally generated in dendrites
Our data reveal that despite differences in dendritic morphology
(Fig. 2A, and Fig. 3A), major T-type Ca2ϩ channel subunit expression (mostly CaV3.1 in TC cells and a combination of CaV3.2
and 3.3 in TRN cells; Perez-Reyes, 2003), and neurotransmitter
released (glutamate/GABA), the two classes of LT-spiking neurons investigated here have remarkably similar dendritic electrical properties. We hypothesized that, in combination with
dendritic expression of T-type Ca2ϩ channels (Crandall et al.,
2010; Errington et al., 2010), these highly conserved properties
would be critical to the most prominent common feature of these
cells, the LTS. Thus, we tested which of three proposed models
(somatic, dendritic, or global initiation) best explains generation
and spread of LTS in LT-spiking neurons. First, we simply examined LTS amplitudes in the soma (LTSS) and dendrites (LTSD) of
TC and TRN neurons. In TC neurons, the amplitude of LTS
could be measured in the presence of Na ϩ-mediated action potentials as the difference between the peak Ca2ϩ spike (Fig. 6A,
black arrow) and the membrane potential before the current injection step. This was not possible in TRN neurons, owing to the
structure of their LTS (Fig. 7A), and quantitative data were therefore obtained from recordings performed in the presence of TTX
(0.5 ␮M). In TC cells, when evoked by either depolarizing or
hyperpolarizing somatic current injection, LTSD showed minimal reduction in amplitude relative to their somatic counterparts
(0.72–1.00, 0.89 Ϯ 0.01, n ϭ 28; Fig. 6 A, C) but did depend on
distance from the soma (␭eff ϭ 697 ␮m, n ϭ 28). In these neurons, differences in the amplitude of LTSS and LTSD in the presence of bath-applied TTX were not significantly different from
those measured under control conditions (0.5 ␮M; 0.77–1.01,
0.86 Ϯ 0.03, n ϭ 7, p ϭ 0.38, unpaired t test; Fig. 6 A, C). In fact,
the difference in amplitude between LTSS and LTSD in TC neurons was similar to (VSS¡VDS) (Fig. 6C), suggesting, perhaps,
that LTS might originate in the soma and propagate into dendrites. However, in TRN neurons, we found that LTSD increased
in amplitude relative to LTSS with increasing distance from the
soma (0.99 –1.24, 1.11 Ϯ 0.03, n ϭ 8), in opposition to
(VSS¡VDS) in these cells (Fig. 7A–C). These data appear inconsistent with a somatic origin and support LTS generation in the
dendrites of LT-spiking cells (see below). Consequently, we
tested whether LTS are initiated in dendrites of LT-spiking cells

J. Neurosci., November 25, 2015 • 35(47):15505–15522 • 15515

using dendritic current injection steps of increasing size. Evoking
LTS using somatic current injection revealed only minimal difference in the voltage threshold (␦V/␦t Ͼ 0.5 mV ⅐ ms Ϫ1) at
which LTS occurred in the soma and dendrites of both TC (Ϫ2.2
to 11.2 mV, 3.7 Ϯ 0.7 mV, n ϭ 25; Fig. 6 D, E) and TRN (Ϫ3.1 to
7.2 mV, Ϫ1.9 Ϯ 1.0 mV, n ϭ 10; Fig. 7 D, E) neurons. It is important to note that in this case, the threshold refers to the apparent
membrane potential in the dendrite at which LTS can be evoked
and does not refer to the activation threshold for T-type Ca2ϩ
channels that we expect to be the same at both the soma and in the
dendrites. In fact, in our computational model, no differences in
activation or inactivation properties of T-type Ca2ϩ channels between soma and dendrites were required to reproduce the voltage
responses we recorded experimentally. In clear comparison with
somatic input, when evoked by dendritic current injection, a pronounced distance-dependent difference in the threshold for LTSS
and LTSD in both TC (Ϫ0.5 to 41.3 mV, 17.1 Ϯ 2.2 mV, n ϭ 25;
Fig. 6 D, E) and TRN (6.5–35.5 mV, 24.20 Ϯ 2.7 mV, n ϭ 10; Fig.
7 D, E) neurons was observed. The distance-dependent difference
between dendritic and somatic threshold reflects the inefficient
VDD¡VSD in these cells. As a consequence, dendritic voltage
change, whose amplitude would be comfortably suprathreshold
for LTS generation if occurring at the soma, was incapable of
triggering “local” dendritic LTS. This does not imply that local
dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ channels do not contribute to local subLTS threshold voltage changes but demonstrates that they are not
sufficient to trigger an all-or-none local LTS without activation of
downstream channels in the soma and contralateral dendrites. As
demonstrated in Figures 6D and 7D, the minimal dendritic depolarization or hyperpolarization required to evoke an LTS was
substantially greater than that required at the soma. On the other
hand, the threshold voltage for LTSS was equal for both somatic
and dendritic current injections in TC (soma, Ϫ59.95 Ϯ 0.46
mV; dendrite, Ϫ58.61 Ϯ 0.87 mV; n ϭ 25, p ϭ 0.22, unpaired t
test) and TRN (soma, Ϫ57.14 Ϯ 1.13 mV; dendrite, Ϫ59.29 Ϯ
0.82 mV; n ϭ 10, p ϭ 0.14, unpaired t test) neurons. Furthermore, the threshold for LTSD, evoked by a large hyperpolarizing
dendritic current injection, was the same as LTSS but substantially lower than the threshold for LTSD evoked by depolarizing
steps (Figs. 6D, 7D).
In fact, the ZAP and ZPP data suggest that, even with an active
contribution from dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ channels, a much higher
degree of amplitude attenuation and phase lag would be expected for
a D¡S propagating signal than we observed between LTSS and LTSD
(Fig. 6B, 7B). Consequently, we conclude that LTS cannot be initiated in dendrites, and to trigger an LTS, dendritic input must be
sufficient to depolarize the soma to LTS threshold.
Low-threshold spikes are generated by a globally
distributed mechanism
Having discounted local dendritic LTS initiation, we examined which of the remaining hypotheses, namely local somatic
or global initiation, is responsible for generating LTS. Since it
is highly improbable that, even in the presence of active conductances, a spike originating in the soma would increase in
amplitude as it propagated into the higher-impedance dendritic tree, the amplitude of LTSD versus LTSS in TRN neurons, coupled with a clear inability to generate LTS in
dendrites, strongly suggests a global mechanism. However, in
TC neurons, the relative amplitudes of LTSD and LTSS are
consistent with both a global or local somatic spike generation
mechanism. Therefore, we focused on LTS generation specifically in TC neurons. First, we reasoned that if they were trig-

gered at the soma, LTS could be blocked by selective inhibition
of only somatic T-type Ca2ϩ channels. To test this, we combined electrical recordings, two-photon Ca2ϩ imaging, and
focal application of the selective T-type Ca2ϩ channel antagonist TTA-P2 (Dreyfus et al., 2010). In the presence of bathapplied TTX (0.5 ␮M) calcium transients (⌬[Ca2ϩ]),
measured in proximal (Ͻ20 ␮m; ⌬G/R, 0.19 Ϯ 0.02; n ϭ 4)
and distal (Ͼ120 ␮m; ⌬G/R, 0.30 Ϯ 0.05; n ϭ 4) dendrites of
TC neurons (Fig. 8 A, B,D) during an LTS evoked by somatic
current injection (42.0 Ϯ 0.9 mV, n ϭ 4), were similar to those
described previously (Errington et al., 2010). Focal application of TTA-P2 (10 ␮m; Fig. 8A), at a concentration sufficient
to easily block all T-type Ca2ϩ channels (Dreyfus et al., 2010),
resulted in ϳ75% reduction in the size of proximal (0.05 Ϯ
0.1, n ϭ 4, p ϭ 0.0027, paired t test) but not distal (0.28 Ϯ 0.05,
n ϭ 4, p ϭ 0.46, paired t test) ⌬[Ca2ϩ] (Fig. 8C,D). Nonetheless, in the presence of TTA-P2, the somatically recorded LTS
remained unaffected (41.4 Ϯ 1.2 mV, n ϭ 4, p ϭ 0.47, paired
t test; Fig. 8B–D). Thus, somatic T-type Ca2ϩ channels are not
a necessary requirement for LTS generation. These data offer

support to the hypothesis that LTS are generated not by a focal
but global mechanism requiring T-channels throughout the
dendritic tree.
The involvement of dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ channels in LTS
generation was supported by dendritic recording experiments.
We surmised that if LTSD passively reflects LTSS, without an
active dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ channel contribution, the ratio of
LTSD and LTSS amplitude (LTSD/LTSS) would be insensitive to
dendritic polarization. However, evoking LTS by brief somatic
current injection during concurrent injection of long current
steps into dendrites (93–122 ␮m from the soma) revealed that
dendritic hyperpolarization (Ϫ40pA, 0.97 Ϯ 0.02; n ϭ 5, p Ͼ
0.05, repeated-measures ANOVA) reduces and depolarization
(ϩ20 pA, 0.77 Ϯ 0.03; n ϭ 5, p Ͻ 0.05, repeated-measures
ANOVA) increases the difference in amplitude between LTSD
and LTSS compared with rest (0 pA, 0.90 Ϯ 0.03, n ϭ 5; Fig.
8 E, F ). Moreover, these experiments reveal that even dramatic
membrane polarization cannot induce local failure of LTS in
dendrites, providing additional support for the global generation
hypothesis.

Nonetheless, although dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ channels appear
to be actively involved in LTS generation and are sufficient in the
absence of somatic channels to generate the LTS, a key question
remains. Is the somatic T-channel density alone sufficient to locally initiate an LTS? Since it is experimentally implausible to
selectively block dendritic T-channels while allowing somatic
channels to remain available, to answer this question we developed a new multicompartment computational model of a TC
neuron based on our novel dendritic recordings and morphology
taken from Briska et al. (2003). Results from four dendrites (Fig.
9A), selected to encompass a range of branching patterns and
local input impedances, demonstrate that our model accurately
reproduces the “passive” cellular properties we observed experimentally, including asymmetric voltage transfer, somatodendritic RN gradient, and uniform Rc distribution (Fig. 1E–G).
Subsequently, to model the LTS, we tested several T-type Ca2ϩ
channel distributions including somatic-only, graded S¡D,
graded D¡S, and uniform distribution. Uniform distribution of
T-type Ca2ϩ channel conductance ( gT) produced model voltage

responses in soma and dendrites most similar to those seen in
dual patch-clamp recordings (Fig. 9B) while also reproducing
intracellular ⌬[Ca2ϩ] equivalent to those described previously
(Fig. 10B; Crandall et al., 2010; Errington et al., 2010, 2012; Sieber
et al., 2013). Moreover, the range of uniformly distributed gT
densities capable of reproducing the voltage signals we recorded
in vitro was relatively narrow, and the optimal value ( gT, 7 ϫ
10 Ϫ5 cm/s) was similar to that reported in a previous study
(Destexhe et al., 1998; Fig. 9C).
Thus, using these parameters, our TC neuron model could
reproduce both the electrical signals and ⌬[Ca2ϩ] observed in the
soma and dendrites during LTS (Fig. 10 A, B). First, consistent
with our previous experimental data (Fig. 8), we found that when
gT was uniformly distributed, its complete removal from the
soma and proximal (Յ20 ␮m from the soma) dendrites alone
had almost no effect on LTS generation (Fig. 10C). In marked
contrast, when the level of gT was systematically and selectively
reduced only in dendrites (Ͼ20 ␮m from the soma), we found a
progressive reduction in the ability to produce LTS (Fig. 10C).

evoked from rest (0 pA) and the ratio of LTSD-to-LTSS (black circles).

Interestingly, we found that a reduction in dendritic gT of ϳ70%
(ϳ1–2 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 cm/s) was required to preclude LTS generation in
our model (Fig. 9C), a finding that mimics previous in vitro data
demonstrating a level of “channel redundancy” for LTS generation in LT-spiking neurons with uniform T-channel distribution
(Dreyfus et al., 2010). Thus, even though the density of somatic gT
(7 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 cm/s) in our standard model conditions was somewhat higher than that estimated in the soma of dissociated TC
neurons (1.7 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 cm/s; Destexhe et al., 1998), in the absence
of dendritic T-channels, our model indicates that somatic channels alone are incapable of generating a local LTS. Finally, to test
whether the inability of somatic channels alone to produce an
LTS under our standard model conditions was attributable to an
underestimate of somatic gT, we concentrated the total conductance from our uniform model into the soma alone ( gT, 9.2 ϫ
10 Ϫ4 cm/s). Whereas this was able to produce LTS in both soma

and dendrites of our model TC neuron (Fig. 10 A, B), these potentials differed significantly from those we recorded experimentally and produced markedly different ⌬[Ca2ϩ] distributions
from those observed experimentally in these dendrites (Fig. 8B;
Crandall et al., 2010; Errington et al., 2010, 2012; Sieber et al.,
2013). Furthermore, similarly to the distributed case, although a
70% reduction in the density of soma-only gT was required to
prevent LTS generation, the resulting gT density (2 ϫ 10 Ϫ4 cm/s)
at which LTS failed (Fig. 10A) remained an order of magnitude
greater than both that estimated at the soma experimentally
(Destexhe et al., 1998) and the minimum density of uniformly
distributed gT ( gT, 2 ϫ 10 Ϫ5 cm/s) capable of producing LTS in
our model (Fig. 9C).
Consequently, we conclude that LTS cannot be locally generated at the soma of LT-spiking neurons. Based on our data, we
propose that LTS are produced by a unique mechanism that ex-

ploits the dendritic electrical properties of LT-spiking neurons to
allow the synchronous recruitment of widely spatially distributed
T-type Ca2ϩ channels. These relatively low-density channels act
in concert to produce a global LTS. Finally, although TC neurons
predominantly express CaV3.1 (␣1G) T-type Ca2ϩ channel subunits and TRN cells express both CaV3.2 (␣1G) and CaV3.3 (␣1I;
Perez-Reyes, 2003), both cells generate LTS using the same globally distributed mechanism. Thus, whereas the precise molecular
identity of the T-type Ca2ϩ channel subunits expressed in particular neurons might shape their LTS properties, specific expression patterns of particular isoforms are not required for global
spike generation as long as T-type Ca2ϩ channels are roughly
uniformly expressed throughout the somatodendritic tree.

Discussion
The major findings of this study are that (1) dendritic properties
are highly conserved between two prominent types of LT-spiking
cells despite differences in their morphology and function; (2)
these properties play a critical role in LTS generation by enabling
synchronous recruitment of spatially distributed dendritic
T-type Ca2ϩ channels; and (3) this underlies a unique whole-cell
Ca2ϩ spiking mechanism that sets the LTS apart as a distinctive,

all-or-none, global somatodendritic electrical and biochemical
signal. We propose that this mechanism applies to all LT-spiking
cells and is likely to have important implications for synaptic
signaling, dendritic integration, and plasticity.
Conserved dendritic properties in LT-spiking neurons
The dendritic properties of LT-spiking neurons have not previously been studied directly, despite evidence of a role for dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ channels in LTS generation (Destexhe et al.,
1998; Williams and Stuart, 2000; Errington et al., 2010). Here, we
find that key features of dendritic electrical conduction are highly
conserved between TC and TRN cells. In particular, our data
reveal that signal transfer between soma and dendrites in these
neurons is strongly directionally asymmetric. Thus, whereas
(VSS¡VDS) is particularly efficient, VDD¡VSD is much more
inefficient. We find that, rather than through loss of current from
leaky dendrites, this marked disparity occurs as a result of drastic
increases in local dendritic ZN with increased distance from the
soma. Consequently, as the distance between two points along
the somatodendritic axis increases, there is little variation in ZC.
This means that the efficiency of current transmission from dendrites to the soma of LT-spiking neurons is virtually independent

Figure 10. Uniform distribution of dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ channels allows global LTS generation. A, Simulated voltage responses to somatic current injections (40 pA steps) in the TC model cell
with varying distribution and density of T-type Ca2ϩ channel conductance. The uniform distribution of conductance most accurately reproduces the voltage response observed in experiments. With
soma-only placement of channels, significantly higher local conductance was required (9.2 ϫ 10 Ϫ4 cm/s) to produce LTS. With this channel distribution, note the unusually long LTS duration
compared with those measured experimentally. Soma-only channels with a density 10-fold greater (2 ϫ 10 Ϫ4 cm/s) than the minimum distributed density required to produce an LTS were unable
to produce an LTS. B, Uniform distribution of T-type Ca2ϩ channels results in similar-sized ⌬[Ca2ϩ] in the soma (blue) and dendrites (red), consistent with previous Ca2ϩ imaging data. Bottom
traces show the ⌬[Ca2ϩ] produced with only somatic T-type Ca2ϩ channels. No increase in dendritic Ca2ϩ is observed with this channel distribution. C, Model LTS with varying T-type Ca2ϩ channel

of the dendritic input location. In a previous study, Jaffe and
Carnevale (1999) demonstrated that in neurons with this somatodendritic profile of ZN and ZC, synaptic currents can produce
nearly equal somatic EPSPs independently of their position
within the dendritic tree; a process they termed “passive normalization.” Our findings indicate that synaptic passive normalization may be an important feature of signaling in LT-spiking
neurons. In TC and TRN neurons, this mechanism could allow
corticothalamic synapses, which are distributed widely across the
dendritic tree, to “democratically” exert an analog-like control
over resting membrane potential and permit a smooth rapid
transition between the burst and tonic firing modes that are characteristic of these cells.
The global low-threshold spike
Our new findings illustrate fundamental differences between the
LTS and other neuronal spikes. Thus, whereas action potentials
are initiated by high-density Na ϩ channels in the axon initial
segment (Kole et al., 2008; Foust et al., 2010) and dendritic Ca2ϩ
(Schiller et al., 1997; Larkum et al., 2009) and NMDA (Schiller et
al., 2000; Larkum et al., 2009) spikes are locally triggered in individual dendritic branches by voltage-gated Ca2ϩ channels or “hot
spots” of clustered NMDA receptor conductance in LT-spiking
cells, because T-type Ca2ϩ channel density is insufficient to produce local spikes, LTS generation relies on activation of distributed dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ conductances. Consequently, LTS do

not propagate in a traditional manner from a focal initiation zone
to the rest of the cell but instead occur throughout the soma and
dendrites simultaneously. The global nature of the LTS sets it
apart from other electrical signaling mechanisms that typically
exert graded effects throughout the somatodendritic tree and are
often locally isolated to specific subcellular compartments (e.g.,
individual dendritic branches; Larkum et al., 2009).
Global LTS generation can be understood by considering the
electrotonic structure of LT-spiking neurons. In particular, since
we find that S¡D voltage transfer is highly efficient with minimal
phase shift, LT-spiking neurons are extremely electrotonically
compact in the S¡D direction. Therefore, although dendritic
T-type Ca2ϩ channels may be separated in physical space by several hundred micrometers (e.g., at the tips of opposing TRN neuron dendrites), in electrotonic space they are much closer
together because the complex, branching dendritic trees of LTspiking neurons are effectively collapsed to allow the cell to behave more like an iso-potential sphere. Thus, as the soma is
depolarized (e.g., by summating synaptic potentials), the membrane potential in even the most distal regions of the dendritic
tree follows with minimal difference in phase or amplitude. This
means that the relatively low-density dendritic T-type Ca2ϩ
channels can be activated together and act in concert to produce
an LTS.
From this model, it is clear that the voltage recorded at any
point on an LT-spiking cell during an LTS relies more on a global

Connelly et al. • The Global Low-Threshold Spike

depolarizing effect produced by summed distal current sources
than depolarization resulting from local current flow. Supporting
this idea, to trigger an LTS, dendritic current injection sufficient to depolarize the soma and, as a consequence of efficient
(VSS¡VDS), the “downstream” dendritic tree to spike threshold
was required. As such, LTS only occur under conditions where
the entire cell is depolarized to LT-spiking threshold. Even strong
dendritic depolarization cannot produce LTS if the resulting somatic potential does not reach spike threshold because local
T-type Ca2ϩ conductance is too low to permit spike initiation.
These data show that, as well as producing Ca2ϩ signals (Crandall
et al., 2010; Errington et al., 2010, 2012; Sieber et al., 2013)
throughout LT-spiking cells, LTS are always associated with a
global electrical signal whose amplitude and phase are mostly
independent of where they are recorded within the cell.
Another explanation for the results we present here is that LTS
are generated by a high-density hot spot of T-type Ca2ϩ channels
in the axon, a structure that, for technical reasons, we are unable
to image or directly record from in these neurons. Several strong
lines of evidence argue against this mechanism. First, the dendritic ⌬[Ca2ϩ] we observed in our computational model, with
uniform somatodendritic distribution of T-type Ca2ϩ, were very
similar to those previously described experimentally (Errington
et al., 2010). This channel distribution accurately reproduced the
somatic and dendritic membrane potential transients we recorded without requiring a focal hot spot of T-type Ca2ϩ channels in the axon or elsewhere. Second, in both TRN neurons and
cortical LT-spiking interneurons, there is no evidence for an axonal hot spot of T-type calcium channels, and instead these channels are found to be distributed across the dendritic membrane
(Liu et al., 2011). Third, in experiments where we focally applied
the T-type Ca2ϩ antagonist TTA-P2 to TC neurons, we saw no
difference in the somatically recorded LTS. In these experiments,
we would also expect to block any T-type Ca2ϩ channels in the
initial segment of the axon. Consequently, these data suggest that
it is unlikely that the LTS is generated by an axonal mechanism
and provide support to the whole-cell mechanism we propose.
LT-spiking neurons share a number of important similarities
including similar morphologies with long thin dendrites that are
relatively aspiny. Specifically, LT-spiking cells lack large apical
dendrites, and as such, their dendritic morphology is compatible
with them having electrical conduction properties similar to
those we have reported for TC and TRN neurons (Jaffe and Carnevale, 1999). LT-spiking neurons also have similar somatically
recorded electrical characteristics, in particular the ability to generate rebound LTS. Furthermore, in common with TC and TRN
neurons (Crandall et al., 2010; Errington et al., 2010), both lowthreshold spiking cortical interneurons (Goldberg et al., 2004)
and subthalamic neurons (Atherton et al., 2010) have LTSevoked T-type Ca2ϩ channel-dependent dendritic ⌬[Ca2ϩ].
Therefore, although recording from dendrites of all LT-spiking
neuron dendrites is beyond the scope of a single study, we anticipate that LTS in all LT-spiking cells result from the global mechanism we have described here.
Physiological consequences of global low-threshold spikes
Whereas our new findings explain how LTS are generated, they
do not answer why a global distribution of T-type Ca2ϩ channels
is favored. In TC neurons, one reason might relate to the fact that
action potential bursts associated with low-threshold spikes more
strongly activate their neocortical targets than single action potentials (Swadlow and Gusev, 2001). As such, it is thought that
this wake-up call represents a critical form of thalamic signaling

to cortex. Since LTS produce a global electrical and biochemical
signal throughout the entire dendritic tree, all synapses would be
able to “sense” the occurrence of an LTS regardless of its location.
Thus, in this case, the LTS acts as an intracellular synchronization
signal that couples this special form of TC output to the site of
synaptic input in the dendrites, perhaps to reset dendritic integration or induce synaptic plasticity. Related to this point, it has
been demonstrated that LTS play a critical role in LTP at inhibitory TRN neuron synapses on to TC neurons by producing Ca2ϩ
entry through both T- and L-type Ca2ϩ channels (Sieber et al.,
2013). In this situation, because of its all-or-none nature, the LTS
could act as a global, somatodendritic plasticity signal causing
synaptic potentiation at all TRN synapses rather than targeting
specific inputs. This may indicate a homeostatic plasticity role for
the LTS that helps to stabilize neurons and networks within particular states (e.g., through Ca2ϩ-dependent enhancement of
HCN channels; Lu¨thi and McCormick, 1998) to alter oscillatory
bursting during sleep.

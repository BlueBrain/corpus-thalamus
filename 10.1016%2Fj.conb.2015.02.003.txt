Feeding the human brain model

The goal of the Human Brain Project is to develop, during the
next decade, an infrastructure capable of simulating a draft
human brain model based on available experimental data. One
of the key issues is therefore to integrate and make accessible
the experimental data necessary to constrain and fully specify
this model. The required data covers many different spatial
scales, ranging from the molecular scale to the whole brain and
these data are obtained using a variety of techniques whose
measurements may not be directly comparable. Furthermore,
these data are incomplete, and will remain so at least for the
coming decade. Here we review new neuroinformatics
techniques that need to be developed and applied to address
these issues.

the computational model that needs to be simulated, and
identify key missing data, which is the topic of this
review. When these challenges are met, the HBP infrastructure will provide the community with new tools to
accelerate the understanding of the brain in health and
disease. The HBP approach can be seen as neuroscience
data integration through model building. The idea is that
only by building an integrated model will neuroscientists
be able to find out whether there is missing data and, if so,
determine an experimental strategy to measure it directly
or use a predictive neuroinformatics approach (see below)
to infer it.

Simulation of the brain models will occur at different
scales and levels of abstraction. The cellular-level biophysical simulation is in simplified terms the numerical
integration of a set of coupled (partial) differential equations. These equations, their parameters, and their initial
conditions, need to be fully specified to run the simulation. For instance, there are differential equations that
describe the time evolution of the membrane potential
and ionic concentrations as a function of spatial location
within a neuron [1,2]. Other equations describe the
molecular cascades inside the cell [3], such as those
involving transcription and translation into proteins
[4,5] that are, for instance, necessary to lay down memories [6]. The general form of the equations is well established, and even though there may be discussion on what
level of simplification is acceptable, the main challenge is
to populate the model parameters with reasonable estimates.

Introduction and background
A key goal of the 1 billion euro, 10 year Human Brain
Project (HBP) is to build a scaffold model of the human
brain. This will enable the global community iteratively
build and refine whole brain models, starting from the
mouse and working towards the human brain, which is
about a thousand times larger. Different teams of
researchers will each deal with different sets of challenges. One set of challenges is to develop the hardware
and software to make it possible to simulate such a largescale model, store and analyze its output, and control the
simulation. Another set of challenges is to fully specify
www.sciencedirect.com

To obtain the necessary data a three-pronged strategy is
needed. First, integrate existing data from different labs.
Second, predict missing data that have not (yet) been
measured. Third, increase the amount of available experimental data through new molecular neurobiology techniques and industrial neuroscience approaches (i.e. high
throughput). A key example of this approach is the work
by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS).

The data integration challenge
The information constraining the HBP model comes from
diverse sources and is obtained using different experimental techniques. Hence, for the same basic assertion,
say the likelihood of a connection between two neurons in
area A and B, there are multiple sources of data, each
potentially giving a different answer. These data need to
be integrated. A key problem is the representation of
information in such a way that they are comparable and so

108 Large-scale recording technology

that their reliability and precision can be quantified and
taken into account.
A group of researchers working in the same lab knows the
experimental settings used when measurements are
made. These measurements are stored in data files, most
likely without documentation of what the units are, or
what preprocessing (filtering) has been done. Information
regarding sampling rates and other parameters might be
stored separately (for instance, written in a lab book) or
assumed to be the default setting specified in the protocol. The data will be subsequently analyzed using tools
bundled with the experimental equipment or lab-specific
user-written code. It will be stored in another file, without
explicitly mentioning these post-processing steps and
their parameters. This set up makes sense within the
lab, but it means that the data are practically useless
outside the lab, because the metadata â€” the additional
information about the experiments â€” is missing. Further,
standardization of the metadata is required to assure
correct interpretation. Hence, an ontology of the concepts
describing the data and measurement parameters needs
to be developed. There are ontologies for neuroscience
concepts, collected in the Neuroscience Information
Framework (NIF) [7], but they do not yet cover the
necessary experimental and analysis protocols in a comprehensive way. When, for instance, axonal projection
patterns are determined using tracing experiments, the
protocol can be structured in different modules, each of
which can be characterized by well-defined parameters
out of an ontology or controlled vocabulary
(Figure 1a). When the data are subsequently stored in
a database and referenced relative to a standard atlas, this
information can be easily accessed by other researchers
[8] (Figure 1b).

Predictive neuroinformatics
Predictive neuroinformatics aims to fill in missing data
based on existing data and general principles. It naturally
builds on methods developed in other fields where similar
problems have been encountered. For instance, during
clinical trials, for a given subject, sometimes only a part of
the measurements are conducted. This leads to incomplete data, with missing entries for particular subjects,
which need to be filled out using so-called imputation
techniques [9]. One can consider these data as a matrix,
where each row represents a subject and each column a
feature. Microarray experiments can also be expressed as
a matrix, where the rows represent conditions and the
columns the expression level for each gene [10], or for
genome wide association studies (GWAS) where the
genotypes of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
are placed in a matrix, with the row representing the
subject and the column the SNP location [11]. The empty
elements in matrix can be filled by replacing each empty
element by the mean value of the corresponding nonempty elements, but more advanced techniques are
Current Opinion in Neurobiology 2015, 32:107â€“114

available [10,12,13]. A recent approach, directly applicable to neuroscience, is matrix completion [14,15]. This
approach assumes that the data matrix is comprised of a
sum of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix [16]. The
solution for this problem resembles the well-known LASSO procedure for regression [17], in which an L1 (i.e.
absolute value) penalty term on the regression weights is
added to the L2 loss function (i.e. squared difference).
This shrinks the weights to zero, with those smaller than a
specific value made exactly zero. In the matrix version,
the low rank part is found by applying a singular value
decomposition (SVD) and shrinking the singular values to
obtain, after reconstitution of the components with the
new singular values and after a number of iterations, the
best fitting low rank matrix [18,19].
The wiring diagram of the nervous system in Caenorhabditis elegans has been determined [20,21], and the gene
expression profile of each cell has also been measured and
made publically available (http://www.wormbase.org).
Analyses reveal that the expression profile can successfully predict the absence or presence of a synapse [22,23].
For the mouse, gene expression patterns [24] and mesoscale connectivity [25] have been made publicly available by AIBS. (Note: the AIBS meso-connectome would
be more appropriately referred to as macro-scale connectivity since currently it is at the level of brain areas rather
than cell populations.) When a similar analysis was applied at the level of brain areas rather than individual
cells, it revealed that the connectivity pattern was to a
large extent predictable by areal patterns of expression
[26,27]. This means that when gene expression patterns
are available, but connectivity data are not, the connectivity can still be predicted.

Experimental sources of data to constrain the
model
Brain areas

To build the brain model, the different brain areas need to
be defined (a parcellation), their typical size determined, as
well as the density of each cell type within that area and the
distribution across substructures (layers, subnuclei). A
number of brain parcellations have been proposed, each
based on different criteria, such as cytoarchitecture or the
density with which receptors are expressed [28]. Recently,
progress has been made with data-driven approaches to
define brain areas. As mentioned above, AIBS has made
available an atlas of transcription patterns in the mouse
brain [24]. Each voxel was characterized by a vector, which
contained the strength of expression of each of the analyzed genes. Nearby voxels, likely belonging to the same
area, should also have a similar expression pattern. When a
clustering procedure was applied to these vectors a parcellation emerges [29] (Figure 2d), which when 60 or
more clusters are sought, resembles parcellations based on
cytoarchitecture in microscopic sections (Nissl stains) or
MRI contrast [30,31] (Figure 2e).

Current Opinion in Neurobiology

Data needs to be properly organized and described in order to be accessible and interpretable for the scientific community. Detailed knowledge
about the anatomical organization of axonal connections is important for understanding normal functions of brain systems and disease-related
dysfunctions. To explore more efficient ways of mapping, analyzing, and sharing detailed axonal connectivity data from the rodent brain, a
workflow for data production and an atlas system tailored for online presentation of axonal tracing data is necessary. The Rodent Brain
WorkBench (www.rbwb.org) is an example of such a tool. (a, left) Flowchart showing four processing steps, beginning with an animal submitted to
an axonal tract-tracing experiment, followed by tissue and image processing steps, to an end result consisting of section images in a database. For

Current Opinion in Neurobiology

Determination of meso-scale connectivity requires robust atlasing technology. (a) A virus was injected at a particular location and labeled the
dendrites and axons of the cells it infected. Fluorescence highlights both the targets of the axonal projection as well as the fibers going there
[25]. To identify which areas are the targets of projections, (left) the fluorescent images need to be mapped onto (middle) slices from a reference
brain through a registration procedure, so that the identity of the labeled areas can be determined in a 3D reference model. (b) The strength of
each projection, quantified as the degree of fluorescence, can then be represented in a connection matrix [25]. (c) Similar connection matrix
restricted to cortical connections was obtained using non-viral tracers [50]. (d) Underlying this matrix is a parcellation of the brain areas. This can
be data driven or done by manual segmentation. For instance, the gene expression pattern can be determined for each voxel, and then the voxels
can be clustered in different groups based on their expression patterns [29]. When each cluster gets a different color, a realistic looking
parcellation emerges. Left: using 50 clusters and right: using 60 clusters. (e) Parcellation based on MRI data and expert annotation [31].

Each brain area is characterized by its shape, size, the cell
types it contains and their density. Cell density is only
known for a few well-studied areas such as the barrel
cortex [32], but it can also be inferred as follows. The
transcription pattern for a voxel is the weighted sum of
the transcription pattern of the cell types that are present
in that area. Hence given the individual cell-type patterns
[33,34], the relative density of each cell type can be
reconstructed [35]. The data so obtained matches the
expected location of the cell types considered, that is,
cerebellar granular cells are recovered in the cerebellum.
Layer-specific transcriptions patterns have also been
obtained [36] making it possible to also infer cell-specific
densities for each layer. These â€˜big dataâ€™ analyses, in
which different publicly available data sets are combined
to infer unmeasured quantities are valuable for constraining whole brain models.

[37]. Techniques to estimate connectivity are currently
undergoing rapid development.
The classical approach for estimating connectivity at the
microcircuit level is to record from two or more cells
simultaneously in a slice, and repeat this across many
slices to sufficiently sample the network, so that various
statistics, such as the connection probability between
different cell types and its distance dependence can be
accurately determined [38,39,40]. When the cells are
filled and subsequently reconstructed [41], information
about the branch statistics of synapses can also be
obtained [42]. In more recent approaches, in which
cells are labeled by fluorescent proteins and the whole
brain is imaged using an automated fluorescence microoptical sectioning tomography system, a much larger
number of cells, including axonal projections, can be
reconstructed [43] (Figure 3b).

Connections between neurons

The cell-based data is manageable because it can be
obtained locally, that is, by fully analyzing a particular area
of the brain, independently of other areas, or by patching,
filling and reconstructing the morphology of a single cell of
that type one at a time. Connectivity, cannot be dealt with
in that way, because the identity of the presynaptic and
postsynaptic cells needs to be known, the corresponding
cell bodies of which are often in different areas, sometimes
far from each other. Furthermore, the axonal/dendritic
branch on which the synapse is made needs to be known
to properly account for effects of postsynaptic integration
Current Opinion in Neurobiology 2015, 32:107â€“114

Molecular neurobiology is making great strides methodologically [44]. For example, Kim and coworkers have
recently adapted a technique used in drosophila for use
in mammalian brains [45]. A green fluorescent protein
(GFP) is split into two parts and attached to two other
proteins, one that is expressed presynaptically and another that is expressed postsynaptically. When at some
location a presynaptic and postsynaptic side are a small
distance apart, and each express the appropriate part of
the protein, the GFP is reconstituted and becomes fluorescent [46] (Figure 3a). This method, referred to as

Current Opinion in Neurobiology

New techniques make it possible to sample synaptic connections at the cellular level. (a) GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners (GRASP).
(1) Cells express GFP fragments localized either to the presynaptic or to the postsynaptic extracellular spaces, respectively. At synapses between
the two cells the split GFP fragments interact to reconstitute GFP. (2) Dendrite showing a number of reconstituted GRASP signals (green) in sites
where dense CA3 axons (blue) intersect with a CA1 dendrite (red) (left) and its reconstruction showing the detected GRASP hot spots (right). (3)

GRASP was applied to determine the statistics of the CA3
to CA1 projection in hippocampus [47] (see below).
Improvements have also been made in determining macro-scale and meso-scale connectivity, which is the connectivity between brain areas and cell populations,
respectively (Figure 2b and c). The typical approach
was to bulk inject a dye, which would then either anterogradely label the axonal projections from the injection
site, or retrogradely label the cell bodies of the neurons
that project to the injection site [48]. AIBS has standardized the protocols for performing this type of experiments. AIBS researchers inject at various locations in
the brain a virus that expresses GFP in the cells near
the injection site and subject the labeled brain slices to a
standardized analysis protocol [25,49] (Figure 2a).
www.sciencedirect.com

Although it serves as a proof of principle, their analysis
does not give enough information to reconstruct a connection matrix at the cell-to-cell resolution. Specifically,
the strength of connection is quantified as the number of
subvoxels in a 100 mm voxel in the target area, for which
the fluorescent signal exceeds a threshold (Figure 2b).
This measure therefore does not directly translate in the
number of synapses made in the target area, which would
be the quantity of interest. Further, terminal fields of fiber
and passing fibers cannot be easily distinguished from
each other. Another (non-viral) approach is to co-inject
two pairs of anterograde and retrograde tracers in two
areas, say area a and b. In this way, four different connections can be discovered, including an indirect connection via an intermediate area [50], which yields similar
connection matrices (Figure 2c). The next step is to use
Current Opinion in Neurobiology 2015, 32:107â€“114

112 Large-scale recording technology

transgenic animals expressing Cre in a specific cell type
[51,52] and inject a virus with a gene for a fluorescent
protein that is floxed. Using this virus, the projection from
specific cells types, which are sometimes restricted to a
specific cortical layer or subcortical nucleus, can be anterogradely labeled. In a recent study the inputs to specific
serotonergic neurons in the raphe nucleus were retrogradely traced using modified rabies viruses [53]
(Figure 3c), which yields information about connectivity
at cellular resolution.
A simple geometric principle, Petersâ€™ rule [54,55], can
predict whether there is a potential synapse between two
neurons. A synapse can only be present when an axon and
a dendrite come close enough for the spine (for excitatory
synapses) to reach the presynaptic bouton, which leads to
a method to construct the connectivity based on the
morphology of the postsynaptic dendrite and the presynaptic axon. The key question is what information can be
reliably extracted from such a construction. One can
estimate the number of synapses between the different
populations [56], ignoring between which neurons the
synapses are, or determine the resulting firing rates
resulting from the numbers obtained in this way [57].
One can also estimate the distribution of synapses across
branch order or path length from soma [42,58]. Overall,
these measurements are consistent with experimental
data, because they are aggregated and represent the
properties of the density of synaptic elements. Petersâ€™
rule also makes some predictions for the synaptic density
at the level of individual neurons. For instance, if the
length of axonal branches in the neighborhood of the
dendrite is constant, synapses from that source should
have a uniform density. This means that the number of
synapses is proportional to the length of the dendritic
branch and the distances between two consecutive synapses on a branch are exponentially distributed. Data
obtained using the GRASP method shows that for the
CA3 to CA1 projection both of these statistics deviate
from the predictions made by Petersâ€™ rule [47]
(Figure 3a).
Although at the aggregate level Petersâ€™ rule predicts the
number and location of synapses, it does not do so at the
cell-to-cell level. This suggests that connectivity matrix
constructed from the density representation of morphologies will match the average properties of a real connectivity
matrix, such as degree distribution, but will deviate in
terms of higher order properties. This presents two issues
for building brain connectivity. First, probabilistic models
for non-random selection of potential synapses need to be
developed. These should at least incorporate cell-type
specific rules, because glutamate-uncaging experiments
have shown [59] that the strength of a connection can
be predicted from cell morphology, but with a proportionality constant that depends on the identity of the projection. This likely also holds for inhibitory circuits [60,61].
Current Opinion in Neurobiology 2015, 32:107â€“114

Second, they could incorporate additional labels that specify cell identity at sub cell-type granularity.
This review has focused primarily on the renaissance of
anatomical studies that is providing detailed structural
information of neural circuits at cellular resolution. An
alternative strategy for characterizing neural circuits is to
record neural activity using imaging methods or electrodes, as reviewed in the other papers in this issue, and to
infer connectivity by various means [62â€“64]. So far these
approaches have mostly focused on local circuits [65â€“67]
or when long-range projections are targeted [68], the
resolution is low, in essence similar to the meso-scale
connectome discussed in preceding text [25]. Longrange projections at the cellular resolution are now coming into sight with new imaging technology that can cover
two brain areas simultaneously [69] and with flexible
electrodes on the brain surface that can record spikes
of individual neurons [70,71]. The structural data will be
used in the HBP to simulate the neural activity patterns,
which link spiking activity at the single neuron level to
large-scale activity at the level of brain areas. The emerging large-scale recording techniques will therefore be
essential to validate these simulations.
Taken together, it is expected that through rapid development and subsequent adoption of new molecular
neurobiology approaches more and more high quality
connectivity data will become available, which places
strong demands on methods to integrate these different
types of data. HBP can make a contribution to these
needs by providing a platform for data integration and
the development of new predictive neuroinformatics
methods.

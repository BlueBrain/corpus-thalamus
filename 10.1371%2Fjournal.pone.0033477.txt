Abstract
Neocortical local field potentials have shown that gamma oscillations occur spontaneously during slow-wave sleep (SWS).
At the macroscopic EEG level in the human brain, no evidences were reported so far. In this study, by using simultaneous
scalp and intracranial EEG recordings in 20 epileptic subjects, we examined gamma oscillations in cerebral cortex during
SWS. We report that gamma oscillations in low (30–50 Hz) and high (60–120 Hz) frequency bands recurrently emerged in all
investigated regions and their amplitudes coincided with specific phases of the cortical slow wave. In most of the cases,
multiple oscillatory bursts in different frequency bands from 30 to 120 Hz were correlated with positive peaks of scalp slow
waves (‘‘IN-phase’’ pattern), confirming previous animal findings. In addition, we report another gamma pattern that
appears preferentially during the negative phase of the slow wave (‘‘ANTI-phase’’ pattern). This new pattern presented
dominant peaks in the high gamma range and was preferentially expressed in the temporal cortex. Finally, we found that
the spatial coherence between cortical sites exhibiting gamma activities was local and fell off quickly when computed
between distant sites. Overall, these results provide the first human evidences that gamma oscillations can be observed in
macroscopic EEG recordings during sleep. They support the concept that these high-frequency activities might be
associated with phasic increases of neural activity during slow oscillations. Such patterned activity in the sleeping brain
could play a role in off-line processing of cortical networks.

human cortex has confirmed that gamma oscillations are strongly
expressed during SWS and are reliably associated with a marked
increase in local cellular discharges, suggesting that they were
associated with cortical UP states [10,11]. Nevertheless, although
activities in the gamma-range have been observed at the scalp level
during a variety of cognitive tasks [12], no evidences of a phasic
expression of gamma activities during SWS in human macroscopic
EEG recordings were reported so far. For example, Fell and
colleagues [13] used the scalp EEG data during sleep and showed
that sigma activity (12–16 Hz) is modulated by slow EEG
oscillations. In another study, Molle and collaborators [14] found
that grouping of spindles and beta oscillations are coincident with
slow waves in human SWS. However, both studies didn’t find a
significant phasic modulation of the gamma activities (.30 Hz) by
the slow waves. It was suggested that the resistive properties of the
skull, muscle artifacts and the relative distance of scalp electrodes
from deeper generators may make it difficult to observe an
intracortical modulation of gamma activity during sleep. These
drawbacks can nevertheless be overcome with the use of
intracranial recordings which furthermore allow the analysis of

Introduction
When sleep reaches its deepest levels during slow wave sleep
(SWS), the electroencephalogram (EEG) is dominated by globally
coherent slow wave activity in the low frequency range (0.5–
3.5 Hz) [1,2]. Local field potentials (LFPs) studies in animals,
moreover, have demonstrated that the power time course of these
slow oscillations shows correlations to other frequency bands.
According to Steriade and coworkers [3], the slow oscillations have
the ability to trigger and group faster cortical oscillations like
spindles (12–15 Hz) and high-frequency activities in the beta (from
15 to 25 Hz) or gamma range (from 30 to 120 Hz). Evidence for
this coupling between slow waves and gamma oscillations comes
from in vivo LFP recordings of the rodent and feline cortex [3–7]
and it can be reproduced in vitro in acute brain slices [8,9]. These
experiments demonstrated that gamma oscillations occur preferentially over the active component of the slow wave (‘UP’ state)
characterized by rhythmic cycles of synaptically mediated
depolarization and disappear during the hyperpolarizing phase
(‘DOWN’ state). A recent study with microelectrode LFPs in the

short-range spatially coherent activities that are not promptly
available with scalp recordings. In the present study, we examined
the presence of gamma patterns during polysomnographically
defined sleep states using intracranial EEG recordings, collected in
parallel with macroscopic scalp EEG, of 20 subjects who required
a clinical invasive evaluation for the treatment of their epilepsy.
This relatively large sample size and broad spatial sampling in this
study (with a total of 740 investigated intracranial electrode sites)
provided an opportunity to evaluate the intracranial distribution of
gamma activities over the whole cortex. Furthermore, the
simultaneous recording of slow waves by scalp EEG allowed us
to analyze different phasic modulations of gamma activities by
global slow components.

previous filtering or pre-processing) or those filtered between 30
and 120 Hz, fast sinusoidal waves appeared in all intracranial
contacts as discrete events which were clearly distinguishable from
background activity (Figure 2C, bottom). The wavelet transformedenergy scalogram, which represents the spectral energy with
respect to time and frequency, precisely characterizes the
frequency components of single detected gamma events. For an
individual recording contact, successive cycles of the slow
oscillation were constituted by a series of pure oscillatory bursts
appearing in narrow frequency bands in the low (,30–50 Hz)
gamma range, high (,60–120 Hz) gamma range or by broadband events composed of a few mixed frequencies (Figure 2C).
When broad-band events were observed, the different oscillatory
components could be superimposed, slightly overlapping, or
completely non-overlapping in time (Figure 2C middle). Note that
gamma activity is plainly observed in the deepest intracranial
contacts, suggesting that these activities cannot be explained by
superficial scalp muscle artifacts, which are regardless very low
during SWS.
Even though the intracranial electrodes in any individual
subject explored a limited part of the brain, the relatively large
sample size (20 subjects; see also Figure 6, yellow spheres) allowed
us to analyze the anatomical distribution of gamma events. We
found that gamma episodes were seen bilaterally during SWS in all
investigated regions of the cerebral cortex (20/20 subjects). From
all contacts located in the temporal lobe (451/740), 56% presented
a significant higher density of gamma events during SWS than
during other stages (comparing density during SWS vs. density in
other stages together, p,0.05, two-tailed permutation-test). For
the frontal lobe (142/740) and occipital lobe (76/740), higher
detections occurred in 42% and 71% of all analyzed contacts,
respectively. We found no significant correlations between the
locations of gamma oscillations and the spatial extension of the
seizure onset zone or propagation regions of epileptic spikes (58%
of contacts presenting significant higher density of gamma
oscillations during SWS were detected outside of these regions),
suggesting that epilepsy is unlikely to be the main source of the
observed oscillations.

Results
Gamma oscillations during SWS
A group of 20 epileptic subjects were included in this study.
Intracranial LFPs were recorded from the surface of the cortex
(subdurally) or from depth electrodes stereotactic implanted in
deeper cortical structures. Details of electrode placement, location
of interictal and ictal epileptic abnormalities are outlined in Table
S1. All subjects had 2 selected overnight recordings. Episodes of
gamma activity (30–120 Hz) were automatically identified across
all stages of vigilance using previous methodology [15], and
detected events were then visually confirmed in the raw traces (see
Materials and Methods and Figure 1). In particular, for the majority
of investigated intracranial contacts (79%, 227 of a total of 286;
n = 8 subjects), the density of detected events (see below) was
significantly higher during SWS than during wakefulness or REM
(p,0.05, two-tailed permutation-test). A representative example of
the gamma detection degree in relation to the sleep-wake cycle for
a single subject is given in Figure 2A. As expected, the timefrequency representation of the power for a scalp electrode
(Figure 2A middle) showed a clear increment of the power in the low
frequency range (,0.3–2 Hz) as the subject entered in the deepest
stages of sleep (S2–S4). This increased rate of slow waves was in
turn accompanied by an increment in the density of gamma
events, measured as the number of detected events per time
interval (20 seconds), presented here for seven intracranial
contacts (Figure 2A bottom). In average, the mean density of
gamma events during NREM sleep periods was 1.1460.45 (mean
6 SD) events per 20-seconds interval (n = 8 subjects), reflecting a
large variability of gamma occurrences on each slow wave activity
cycle.
In order to illustrate the relation between the gamma activity
and the presence of slow waves, Figure 2B illustrates typical
recorded patterns during sleep stage 4. A predominant slow
activity can be seen in raw signals for both, surface (FP1) and
depth electrodes (here in the left orbito-frontal gyrus). Note the
reversed polarities between the scalp and the intracranial activities,
confirming what has been previously shown in animal studies [3].
The average main peak in the power spectra was estimated here at
0.8560.08 Hz (on average over n = 25 contacts) and the wave
shapes at the scalp level fulfilled standard electrographic criteria of
normal slow oscillations [16]. Concerning the signals filtered in the
gamma-range, near-periodic bursts of increased amplitude could
be observed in all intracranial contacts (but not at level of the
scalp) at the depth-negative phase (respectively surface-positive
phase) of the slow oscillations in the raw signals. A spectral analysis
of the gamma envelopes indicated a main frequency peak of these
bursts at 0.8860.15 Hz (n = 25 contacts), confirming a relationship between the occurrences of gamma bursts and the slow
oscillations during SWS. In either the raw signals (without any

Phasic modulation of gamma oscillations by the slow
waves
To examine the possible modulation of gamma activity by the
slow waves, we analyzed the temporal relationship between the
phases of the slow wave and the occurrence of gamma activity.
Over the entire recording session, the automatic detection
algorithms independently identified slow waves and gamma
oscillations for all investigated intracranial contacts (see Materials
and Methods). Only slow waves where gamma events were detected
inside a window of 2 seconds around the central peak of each
intracranial slow wave were selected for analysis (see Figure 1 and
Figure 3). Furthermore, we analyzed only contacts having a
sufficient number of detected slow waves (.25; 233 of 740
contacts from 19 of 20 subjects). Analysis of individual gamma
activities revealed three broad patterns of gamma modulation by
the slow oscillation: In the first pattern, gamma events preferentially appeared during the positive phase of the scalp slow wave
(‘‘IN-phase’’ pattern). In the second, gamma events tend to appear
during the negative phase of the scalp slow wave (‘‘ANTI-phase’’
pattern). In the third pattern, there was no specific phase
preference of the incidence of gamma events to the slow wave,
meaning that gamma activity could be equally present during the
positive as well as during the negative phase. Examples of phasic
gamma modulations associated with IN-phase and ANTI-phase
patterns are shown in Figure 3A and 3B for intracranial contacts in

cies were seen in 42% and 38% of each case. Concerning the
distribution of their frequency, gamma events associated with the
IN-phase pattern (Figure 3C top-right) had multiple dominant peaks
scattered across the whole gamma range at around 41, 67, 87 and
105 Hz. For the ANTI-phase pattern, in contrast, only two
dominant peaks could be seen in the high gamma range around 70
and 97 Hz (Figure 3D top-left).
Recorded intracranially, slow waves showed depth-positive or
depth-negative components (see Figure 3A and 3B), reflecting
respectively inward currents in the superficial layers and outward
currents in the deep cortical layers [17]. In order to assess whether
IN-phase and ANTI-phase patterns were related to particular
depth-components of the slow waves, we examined the value of
the central peak of the intracranial slow wave associated to each
pattern (Figure 1). In particular, for all slow waves associated with
IN-phase and ANTI-phase patterns (from 15/19 and 7/19
subjects respectively, see above) we investigated if there was a
systematic reverse of polarity between scalp and intracranial
waves. No significant relationship was found between the polarity
reversal of the intracranial slow wave and the corresponding phase
of appearance of gamma events (Figure 4).
We next analyzed the temporal occurrence of IN-phase and
ANTI-phase patterns relative to the central peak of the scalp slow
wave (time 0 in Figures 3C bottom and 3D bottom). We observed that
events associated with the IN-phase pattern preferentially
appeared at around 20.5 seconds and 0.28 seconds of the slow
wave cycle, and tended to be absent around 20.165 seconds
(Figure 3C bottom). In contrast, events associated with the ANTIphase pattern preferentially occurred at around 20.05 seconds of

the cingulate gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus. For both
patterns, the majority of gamma events were constituted by single
oscillatory bursts lying in a narrow frequency band (63% and 62%
of the cases for Figure 3A and Figure 3B, respectively; see also
histograms in Figure S1). For the IN-phase pattern, however, a
broad-band extension of activities in the gamma band can be
identified as consequence of the overlapping, after averaging, of
multiple oscillatory bursts appearing in different frequency bands
across the whole gamma range from 30 to 120 Hz (Figure 3A
bottom). In contrast, a narrow band extension of gamma activities
around 70 Hz were associated with the ANTI-phase pattern
(Figure 3B bottom). Additional examples of phasic gamma
modulation associated with IN-phase and ANTI-phase patterns
are illustrated in Figure 7F.
Over all subjects, gamma activities from all investigated
electrodes were associated with one of the three patterns by using
a measure of similarity between the distributions in time of the
detected gamma events (see Material and Methods). From all selected
gamma events, 52% of the intracranial contacts (122/233) from 15
of 19 subjects were modulated by the IN-phase pattern (Figure 3C
top-left). In contrast, only 9% of the contacts (21/233) from 7 of 19
subjects (5 from the 15 above) were modulated by the ANTI-phase
pattern (Figure 3D top-right). The total number of individual slow
waves selected from all electrode contacts associated with the INphase and ANTI-phase patterns were 20363 and 2078 respectively. From these slow waves, gamma oscillations were, in most of
the cases, constituted by pure narrow band frequencies for both,
IN-phase and ANTI-phase patterns (56% and 60% of the cases
respectively). Oscillatory bursts composed of two mixed frequen-

the slow wave cycle (Figure 3D bottom). To further investigate the
phase relationship between slow waves and gamma oscillations, we
distinguished two different moments of the gamma events: first,
the onset time at which the event was first detected (to in Figure 1)
and, second, the time at which the event reached its maximal
amplitude (tm in Figure 1). In order to quantify whether these
events tended to systematically occur at a particular phase of the
slow wave, we used a circular statistical test to assess the
nonuniformity of the corresponding phase distribution across all
the detected slow waves (see Materials and Methods). Quantitative
assessment revealed that, from all contacts associated respectively
with IN-phase (122 from 15 subjects) and ANTI-phase (21 from 7
subjects) patterns, 44% (54/122) and 52% (11/21) presented
statistically significant phase-locking (p,0.01, Rayleigh test for
circular uniformity) when considering the event’s onset time, and
52% (64/122) and 52% (11/21) when considering the event’s
maximal amplitude time (Figure 5). In accordance with the
distributions in time, relative to the central peak of the slow wave,
the preferred phases calculated for the onset times and maximal
amplitude times respectively, were obtained for the IN-phase and
the ANTI-phase patterns at 6.13 radians (,0.5625 sec) and 3.05
radians (,20.015 sec), and at 0.1 radians (,20.5675 sec) and 3.8
radians (,0.125 sec) for the same, respective patterns. Interestingly, for the onset time of ANTI-phase patterns, the phases of the
slow wave tended to be highly concentrated in a sharp peak,
whereas the phases of maximal amplitude time tended to lie in a
wider interval.
The spatial distribution of the electrode contacts related to each
of these two patterns revealed that phase-modulated gamma
patterns were strongly expressed in the frontal and temporal lobes
(Figure 6). In particular, 39% and 37% of electrodes associated
with the IN-phase pattern were localized in the frontal and
temporal lobes respectively while, for the ANTI-phase patterns,
29% and 62% of electrodes were associated respectively with the
frontal and temporal lobes. This suggests a tendency for the
ANTI-phase pattern to be more expressed in temporal regions
while the IN-phase pattern was more homogeneously distributed
in any of these two lobes (percentages of electrodes in other regions

are not presented because the involved contacts were less than
10%, partially due to the fact that most of the contacts were
located in frontal and temporal regions, see Table S1).
We further examined if the sites expressing IN-phase or ANTIphase patterns were related to pathological areas. We observed
that most of the contacts associated with both modulation patterns
were neither located in ictal nor inter-ictal regions. More precisely,
from all contacts associated with IN-phase patterns, 84% and 80%
were not located respectively in ictal or inter-ictal zones; For
ANTI-phase patterns, 90% and 71% of contacts were not
correspondingly associated with ictal or inter-ictal zones (Tables
S2 and S3).

Short-range intracortical coherence of gamma
oscillations during SWS
The synchronization properties of gamma events occurring at
different intracranial contacts during slow waves were evaluated.
We first estimated the co-detection probability, i.e. the probability of
detecting a gamma event in one contact at a specific time, given
that an event has been also detected in another contact, for the
same time and for the same frequency band (see Materials and
Methods). The distribution of this probability revealed an
exponential-like decrement (Figure 7A) which was best fitted to a
gamma distribution (4.7961025 mean squared error; shape and
scale parameters: k = 0.88 and h = 23.26). This observation
implied that the probability to find a co-activation between two
arbitrary channels was very low despite the fact that gamma
oscillations emerged in a large number of investigated individual
channels. This obtained tendency was further confirmed by the
relation between the co-detection probability and the distance between
contacts, calculated via their Talairach coordinates in the 3D
space (n = 11 subjects, Figure 7B). We found that the co-detection
probability of gamma oscillations fell off quickly with distance,
suggesting that gamma co-activations can only be frequently
observed over short-distances, therefore within a single cortical
area or between adjacent cortical areas. The slope of the
decrement was estimated to be around 20.41 mm per probability
percentage, meaning, for example, that the probability for a given

event to be detected at the same time in two contacts would be
25% lower if the separation between them were increased by
10 mm. The cortical distribution of channels presenting a codetection probability over 50% revealed that the frontal lobe had a
greater tendency to express gamma co-activations, followed by the
temporal lobe and the cingulate cortex (Figure 7C, blue bars). In
contrast, the parietal, occipital and insular cortices only displayed
a very low tendency of gamma co-activations.
We next examined whether gamma activities that cooccurred in space at two different places were also oscillating
in phase (i.e. were phase-locked). For this, we selected all
channels with a co-detection probability over 50% (2121 pairs of
contacts from 14 subjects and from a total of 28417 pairs over
all analyzed frequency bands in the gamma range) and we
calculated the windowed phase-locking value (PLV) and the
cross-correlation coefficient (CC), both quantities giving values
varying from 0 to 1, where 1 means perfect synchrony (see
Materials and Methods). In a large number of cases, significant
synchronization could be identified during gamma co-activations by both measurements (p,+0.001, two-tailed permutationtest; for PLV and CC, in 83.5% and 86% of the cases
respectively). Similarly to gamma co-activations, we found that
the number of synchronous pairs fell off quickly with distance
(Figure 7D and Figure S2A). Nevertheless, in contrast to gamma
co-activations, the strength of the synchronization did not
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org

decrease with the distance, suggesting that strong synchrony
could happen, with a low probability, between two widely
separated contacts (Figure 7E and Figure S2B). The cortical
distribution of channels presenting significant synchronous
activities (for both PLV and CC) revealed that the frontal lobe
had a greater tendency to express more gamma synchronization
followed by the cingulate and the temporal ones (Figure 7C,
yellow and red bars).
We finally examined the relationship between the phases of the
slow wave and the co-activations of gamma oscillations. In
particular, from all channels presenting significant synchrony, we
evaluated whether co-activations tended to systematically appear
at a particular phase of the slow wave (see Materials and Methods).
From all analyzed co-activations, we found that only 2.8%
presented a systematic temporal relationship with the slow wave
(p,0.01, Rayleigh test for circular uniformity). Examples of
contact pairs presenting this infrequent phenomenon are shown
in Figure 7F. For these pairs of contacts, we estimated the phaselocking of the gamma oscillations calculated across all corresponding slow waves. As illustrated in these examples and
observed most of the time (65.4%, representing pairs of contacts
from 8 subjects), the phasic modulation of gamma synchronization corresponded to IN-phase and ANTI-phase patterns
(Figure 7G). The preferred phases together with the preferred
times were estimated respectively to 0.74 radians (,20.4475 sec)

They were characterized by oscillations in narrow frequency
bands in the low (,30–50 Hz) and high gamma (,60–120 Hz)
ranges. 2) Different patterns of phasic activation of gamma
oscillations could be identified: IN-phase gamma patterns tended
to appear around the positive phase of the scalp SW. They were
strongly expressed in the frontal and temporal cortical regions and
were, in most of the cases, constituted by narrow band frequencies
distributed over the whole gamma range from 30 to 120 Hz. In

The main observations of our study can be summarized as

observed during SWS in the majority of investigated cortical LFPs.

beta activities reported for human scalp EEG [13,14]. This
depolarization phase is associated with increased cortical firing,
which drives the generation of spindle, beta and gamma
oscillations in thalamo-cortical feedback loops [3]. In addition,
we also reported ANTI-phase gamma events, having distinctive
frequency/spatial properties and appearing preferentially during
surface-negative components of slow waves corresponding to
cortical cellular hyperpolarization. These ANTI-phase patterns
had onset times highly concentrated around the negative peak of
the scalp slow waves, in contrast to the phases of their maximal
amplitude times, more scattered over a wider interval. This further
suggests that ANTI-phase gamma events were initiated at the
beginning of the DOWN state, known to be precisely synchronized [28]. Interestingly, cellular activities and gamma oscillations
were already reported in the rat hippocampus to emerge during
the neocortical-paleocortical DOWN states [5]. One explanation
for our reported ANTI-phase patterns, particularly expressed over
the temporal cortex, is that hippocampal projections to the cortex
drive fast rhythmic post-synaptic EPSPs during the hyperpolarizing (surface negative) phase of the slow wave, associated with
cortical firing silence. The global lack of correlation between
higher density of gamma oscillations and epileptogenic tissue
provides some reassurance, albeit indirect, that gamma activity
was not mainly caused by epilepsy. Nevertheless, it cannot be fully
excluded that ANTI-phase patterns were not generated by
aberrant synchronization remote from chronic epileptic circuits.
Additional research is here needed to precise the neuronal origins
of this new type of pattern.
Thanks to the relatively large sample size as well as to a broad
spatial sampling, we were able to evaluate in our study the
intracranial coherence of gamma oscillations over a comprehensive extent of the human cerebral cortex. According to our
observations, gamma oscillations were frequently phase-locked
over short-distances, but this synchronization decreased rapidly in
space. This local spatial coherence between close-by electrodes
could be explained by the large surface area of the used
macroelectrode that may record partly overlapping source
distributions. In the same way, it has been reported in felines
that the coherence at approximately zero phase lag between
activities in high-frequency ranges was only observed for cortical
sites located within few millimeters of distance (,5 mm) [3]. Our
findings are also consistent with other studies in humans that were
not able to demonstrate gamma band coherence at large distance
(greater than 14 mm) between intracranial EEG sites [29]. This
short-range spatial confinement of coherent fast rhythms is
consistent with previous observations during wakefulness reporting
that fast oscillations are synchronized locally in both space and
time, as shown by the very restricted cortical areas and time
windows in which coherent fast oscillations appear [30].
What could be the function of these gamma patterns? As
proposed before, the network dynamics during active states of
deep sleep have been proposed to be equivalent to those observed
during the waking state [31,32]. In agreement with this proposal,
our observations of gamma during SWS are very similar to
gamma responses induced by a variety of waking tasks reflecting
an increased alertness and also recorded with intracranial EEG
[19,33,34]. Furthermore, activation patterns during SWS are also
known to be close to the waking default mode network (DMN)
[35,36]. Following this similarity, it has been proposed that
gamma oscillations during SWS may reflect recalled events

contrast, ANTI-phase patterns tended to appear during the
negative phase of the scalp slow wave. They were more expressed
in temporal regions and had only a few dominant peaks in the high
gamma range (around 70 and 95 Hz). 3) The spatial coherence of
gamma events occurring at different intracranial contacts during
slow waves was only local and fell off quickly with distance.
A first novel finding of our study was that spontaneous gamma
oscillations from 30 to 120 Hz, recorded at the macroscopic EEG
level, were strongly expressed during deep sleep in the human
cortex. This may be surprising because faster rhythmic EEG
activity were generally reported in relation to waking functions
such as sensory perception, attention or memory [18–20].
Furthermore, several previous EEG studies have reported that
gamma activity is highest during wakefulness and REM, and
lowest during SWS, in both humans [21,22] and animals [23]. As
mentioned before [11], this discordance could be explained by the
fact that, in those previous studies, fast oscillatory activities were
estimated through an average over several minutes of recording
which is not an appropriate methodology for the detection of
transient events lasting only few hundred milliseconds and
separated by long periods of silence. Our results are nevertheless
in agreement with LFPs observations in sleeping or anesthetized
animals reporting activations in the beta/low gamma and high
gamma ranges during the depolarization phase of the slow wave
[3–7,24]. Furthermore, our observations are consistent with a
recent microelectrode study reporting that distinct narrow band
oscillations in the low (40–80 Hz) and high (80–120 Hz) gamma
ranges were locally expressed in the LFPs of the human cortex
during SWS [11]. In accordance, we confirmed with clinical
macroelectrodes in the human cortex that different discrete
spectral peaks can be consistently identified in the low and high
gamma range. On the basis of these observations, we can postulate
that our recorded gamma oscillations reflect the same local, highly
synchronous field activities as those recorded with microelectrodes.
The possibility to record these oscillations with intracranial
macroelectrodes of large surface area greater than 1 mm2 suggests
that an activity of ,100 mm3 of brain tissue should be involved
here [25].
As previously shown [26,27], minimal eye movements (so-called
microsaccades) can induce gamma activities in scalp EEG but also
in intracranial recordings. We think however that the gamma
activities reported in our analyses are unlikely the product of such
a kind of artifacts but instead the result of a physiological cortical
activity. Arguments in favor of this are: (1) we analyzed only
periods during NREM, and in particular during slow wave sleep
stages where the eye movements (rolling eye balls) are minimum
compared to wake or REM sleep stages; (2) while, when they
appeared, gamma-activities were clearly visible on intracranial
contacts, they were absent at the scalp level; (3) gamma activities
reported here were found to be modulated by the slow oscillations,
known to generate no phasic motor events.
A second novel observation of the present study was the
existence of two gamma patterns in the human cortex defined by
their relations with the phases of the cortical slow oscillations. In
most of the cases, gamma oscillations were correlated with positive
peaks of scalp slow waves, confirming previous animal data
suggesting that gamma oscillations occur during the active
component of the slow wave (‘UP’ state). This observation of
enhanced gamma activities during surface-positive components of
slow oscillations is also consistent with the grouping of spindle and

2002 and July 2007 in the epilepsy unit at the Pitie´-Salpeˆtrie`re
hospital in Paris. Each patient was continuously recorded during
several days (duration range, 9–20 days; mean duration, 15 days)
with intracranial and scalp electrodes (Nicolet acquisition system,
CA, US). Both scalp and depth EEG data were continuously
recorded at a sampling rate of 400 Hz. The placement of scalp
electrodes was adapted to each patient in order to facilitate the
implantation of intracranial electrodes but the montage always
involved electrodes at T9, TP9, T10, TP10, FPZ, FP1 and FP2
locations. Depth electrodes were composed of 4 to 10 cylindrical
contacts 2.3-mm long, 1-mm in diameter, 10-mm apart center-tocenter, mounted on a 1 mm wide flexible plastic probe. Subdural
electrodes were strips with 4 to 8 one-sided circular contacts,
2.3 mm in diameter and with a center to center separation of
10 mm. Pre and post implantation MRI scans were evaluated to
anatomically and precisely locate each contact along the electrode
trajectory. Talairach coordinates of intracranial contacts could be
successfully estimated for 11 subjects through BrainVisa/Anatomist (http://brainvisa.info/index_f.html). The placement of electrodes within each patient was determined solely by clinical
criteria; however, the routine clinical use of broad anatomical
coverage for intracranial recordings provided a large sample of
electrophysiological data from tissue outside of the epileptogenic
zone (Table S1). Common average reference montage was chosen
as our previous work on intracranial high-frequency activities [25].
This montage was chosen in order to avoid the introduction of
unrelated information from the two referential time-series into the
bipolar time-series, or from the removal or alteration of
information common to the two referential time-series in the
bipolar time-series. Noisy electrodes and those presenting high
epileptic activity were excluded from the average by visual
inspection. Digital bandpass filtering between frequencies f12f2
was, in all cases, implemented through a forward-backward digital
infinite impulse response (IIR) type II Chebyshev filter (passband:
f1#f#f2 Hz, attenuation #1 dB, monotonic; stopband: f#(f12k) or
f$(f2+k) Hz, where k = 0.5 for f1,2$1 Hz or k = 0.05 otherwise,
attenuation $100 dB, equiripple). Electrical line noise at 50 Hz
was suppressed by a bandstop filter of the same type. All analyses
were implemented in MATLABH 7.5 (The MathWorksTM, MA,
USA). All patients gave their written informed consent and
procedures were approved by the local ethical committee (CCP).

experienced previously [11,37]. Interestingly, recent intracranial
EEG evidences suggested that all DMN areas displayed transient
increases and decreases of broadband gamma (60–140 Hz) power
during goal-directed behavior [38]. Therefore, gamma oscillations
during SWS could recurrently restore an intrinsic form of largescale brain dynamics, typical of wakefulness, and trigger over time
an activity-dependent reinforcement pathway like LTP, leading to
a progressive consolidation of local cortical circuits [39], thus
complementing the roles of gamma oscillations in encoding and
retrieval of memory traces during wakefulness [40,41]. Indeed, as
previously reported [11], these cortical gamma oscillations may be
also triggered by hippocampal ripples-sharp waves and may
coordinate, at the cortical level, the reactivation of hippocampusdependent memories [42,43]. In this context, as it has been
proposed by others [5], while gamma oscillations during ‘‘UP’’
states (IN-phase pattern) may facilitate the hippocampal-neocortical transfer of previously coded information via parahippocampal
pathways [11], neocortical gamma oscillations during ‘‘DOWN’’
states (ANTI-phase pattern) may reflect an intrinsic hippocampal
replay and a modification of intrahippocampal and entorhinal
cortical connectivity. Additional research is here justified to clarify
the role of IN-phase or ANTI-phase gamma events in the
supposed iterative mechanisms of memory reprocessing during
SWS. It is anticipated that further insights into the role of gamma
activities during sleep will accrue from studying phenomena such
as lucid dreaming [44] and sleep-state misperception [45], in
which patients report the subjective experience of wakefulness
during polysomnographically defined sleep.
We have reported here the presence of intracranial gamma
oscillations in epileptic patients recorded during seizure-free
periods and we have shown that these oscillations coincide with
non epileptic activities such as slow sleep oscillations. Nevertheless,
epileptic oscillations in the same frequency range are well known
in intracranial EEG recordings of the epileptic regions of patients
with temporal and extra-temporal epilepsy, at seizure onset
[46,47] or throughout the interictal period [48]. Furthermore, as
already reported in patients with frontal lobe seizures [49],
epileptic gamma oscillations appear to be closely related to sleep,
especially in the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex. In addition to
these observations, experimental models have led to the proposal
that these fast oscillations could be involved in the initiation of
seizures [50]. This raises the question about the relations between
physiological and epileptic gamma oscillations. From our point of
view [11] and as also suggested by other authors [48], the
increased high frequency activity seen at the onset of some seizures
could be the result of an aberration of the same physiological
mechanisms underlying gamma activations in SWS. Indeed,
strong gamma oscillations may be driven in the epileptic cortex
by transient paroxysmal neuronal depolarization, in a similar way
than the strong potential fluctuations which occur during the
normal sleep. Furthermore, epileptic processes are well-known to
be characterized by a general tendency of hypersynchronization of
normal oscillations, as seen for example in the epileptic facilitation
of sleep spindles [51] or ripples [52]. This aberrant hyperexpression may possibly imply the same physiological mechanisms
underlying memory consolidation, leading to a progressive
reinforcement of local epileptogenic circuits [48].

Sleep studies
Two seizure-free nights with at least two complete sleep cycles
were chosen from all subjects. Each night was scored for sleep
stages using the software SomnologicaTM Studio (Embla Systems,
Inc, CO, USA) and visually confirmed by a time-frequency
analysis.

Slow waves detection
Slow waves were first detected from a single scalp electrode and
only from segments during NREM sleep. Since not all subjects
shared exactly the same number of scalp electrodes, FP1 was
chosen for the analysis because it was systematically recorded. For
the automatic detection of the slow waves, the signal was first
down-sampled to 40 Hz and then bandpass-filtered between 0.1–
4 Hz. The criteria for the detection of the slow waves were similar
to those used in [53] and [16]: (1) a negative wave between two
succeeding zero-crossings separated by 0.125–1 sec and presenting
only one main peak #280 mV and, optionally, other negative
peaks not exceeding 50% of the main one (in absolute value); (2) a
subsequent (or antecedent) positive wave between two succeeding
zero-crossings separated by 0.125–1 sec; (3) a negative-to-positive
(or positive-to-negative) peak-to-peak amplitude $140 mV (see

Figure 1). In order to select only large-extended slow waves, an
additional criterion was used to confirm the simultaneous presence
of the slow components on intracranial contacts. According to
that, we only kept waves for which the average of all intracranial
negative peaks (when presented in at least 30% of the total number
of contacts) during the scalp positive peak was #260 mV. Finally,
we rejected slow waves presenting interictal epileptic discharges
inside a window of 2 seconds around the minimal scalp negative
peak.

Co-detection probability and distribution fitting
For every pair of intracranial contacts, we estimated the
probability of detecting a gamma event in one contact given that
an event, in the same frequency band and for the same time, has
been also detected in another contact. Co-detection was defined
when both events had an overlapping of at least 50% respect to the
total event duration (Dtw in Figure 1). Probability estimation was
performed only for frequency bands presenting at least 25 events.
In order to fit the statistical distribution given by the co-detection
probability, we tested the following known distributions: Exponential, Poisson, Gamma, Chi-squared, Rayleigh and Weibull.

Automatic detection of gamma oscillations
An automatic detection of high-frequency events was performed
separately for each intracranial contact and for the whole sleepwake cycle and independently of the presence of slow waves. In
order to detect oscillations, the whole gamma range was
subdivided in consecutive sub-bands of 20-Hz each
(f22f1 = 20 Hz, f2.f1), from 30 to 120 Hz. For each one of these
sub-bands, oscillations were detected according to a similar
procedure than those presented in [15]: First, the envelope of
the bandpass-filtered signal was obtained via the Hilbert
transform. Then, a threshold for detection was defined consisting
on all successive envelope values with amplitudes .3s above the
mean amplitude of the envelope signal (the mean and the standard
deviation (s) computed from free-of-artifacts periods, selected
along the whole night by visual inspection). From all detected
events, we selected only events having more than 6 oscillatory
cycles (calculated from the mean frequency (f1+f2)/2 of the current
frequency band), and presenting more than 5 local maxima in
both original and filtered signals (see Figure 1).

Synchronization between two gamma oscillations
Synchronization between pairs of co-detected gamma events was
estimated by the cross-correlation coefficient (CC) and the
windowed phase-locked value (PLV). Their analysis followed two
steps: First, pairs of signals were narrow-band filtered in the
corresponding co-detection frequency band. Second, the following
two measures were calculated: 1) CC: For the pair of filtered
signals, the cross-correlation coefficient was estimated by
CC = C(s1, s2)/(C(s1, s1) C(s2, s2))1/2, where C corresponded to the
covariance function (at zero-lag) and sk for k = 1,2 to signal k. Thus,
C(s1, s2) corresponded to the cross-covariance at zero-lag between
the pair of signals in the co-detected event and C(s1, s1) and C(s2, s2) to
the variance for each signal respectively. 2) PLV: This analysis was
introduced to overcome some limitations of correlation methods
which do not disentangle amplitudes and phases [55]. The phases
of both filtered signals were calculated via the Hilbert transform
and the difference between them was then
calculated.

YK is the phase difference (mod 2p) for the corresponding k time
and N the total number of phase difference values inside the time
window corresponding to the co-detection event (Dtw in Figure 1).
In order to further test for statistical significance, surrogate data
was generated from each one of both measurements and a
permutation test was then performed [56].

Oscillation analysis
The central frequency of each detected oscillation was
determined by the frequency at which a peak appeared in the
power spectral density (PSD) obtained via the Burg method. The
corresponding signals were zero-padded to the next higher power
of two, but in all cases the resulting length was $512 points. The
order of the autoregressive model was set to 10.

Phase-locking of gamma activations and slow waves
Time-frequency representations

In order to examine the relationship between the phases of the
slow wave and the activation or the co-activation of gamma
oscillations, we used following procedure: First, the phases of the
slow waves were estimated through the Hilbert transform of the
filtered signals in the low frequency band (0.1–4 Hz). Second, the
phase value QK (mod 2p) of the slow waves corresponding to the
detection or the co-detection times were computed (depending on
the first
the analysis, it could be to or tm in Figure 1). Finally,
P from
jqk
trigonometric moment defined by M~ð1=N Þ N
k~1 e , a phase
modulation index was estimated across all corresponding slow
waves by the modulus of M, where N was the total number of
phase values. Given the Rayleigh statistic Z = N |M|2, the
probability that the null hypothesis of sample uniformity holds was
given by P = e2Z [1+(2Z2Z2)/(4N)2(24Z2132Z2+76Z329Z4)/
(288N2)] [57]. The preferred phase was estimated by the phase of
M and the corresponding preferred time was approximated by a
slow wave of frequency 0.85 Hz.

Time-frequency transformations for power and phase estimations were obtained through a Gabor wavelet, implemented with a
modulated Gaussian window [54]. The number of cycles of the
wavelet was set to 5.

Phasic modulation of gamma oscillations by the slow
waves
In order to determine possible patterns of phasic modulation by
the slow waves, we estimated separately for each intracranial
contact the distribution in time of gamma events detected inside a
window of 2 seconds around the minimal scalp negative peak of
the slow waves. Only intracranial contacts presenting slow waves
were analyzed by requesting that the absolute value of the crosscorrelation coefficient between the scalp slow wave and the related
intracranial one was $0.6 since these values allowed the
simultaneous analysis of scalp and intracranial slow wave activity.
For all these investigated intracranial contacts, these distributions
were then grouped in different patterns following a criterion of
similarity, consisting in grouping the most similar among them.
For this, we calculated the cross-correlation between all possible
distributions and we considered a group when all the crosscorrelation coefficients between their distributions had a minimal
value of 0.76, corresponding to the value at which the number of
elements inside one of the groups became stable.

Phasic modulation of gamma phase synchronization by

oscillations, we used a similar procedure than those previously
used [55]: First, the phases of both signals were calculated through

doi:10.1152/jn.00647.2013.—The signaling properties of thalamocortical (TC) neurons depend on the diversity of ion conductance mechanisms that underlie their rich membrane behavior at subthreshold
potentials. Using patch-clamp recordings of TC neurons in brain slices
from mice and a realistic conductance-based computational model, we
characterized seven subthreshold ion currents of TC neurons and
quantified their individual contributions to the total steady-state conductance at levels below tonic firing threshold. We then used the TC
neuron model to show that the resting membrane potential results
from the interplay of several inward and outward currents over a
background provided by the potassium and sodium leak currents. The
steady-state conductances of depolarizing Ih (hyperpolarization-activated cationic current), IT (low-threshold calcium current), and INaP
(persistent sodium current) move the membrane potential away from
the reversal potential of the leak conductances. This depolarization is
counteracted in turn by the hyperpolarizing steady-state current of IA
(fast transient A-type potassium current) and IKir (inwardly rectifying
potassium current). Using the computational model, we have shown
that single parameter variations compatible with physiological or
pathological modulation promote burst firing periodicity. The balance
between three amplifying variables (activation of IT, activation of
INaP, and activation of IKir) and three recovering variables (inactivation of IT, activation of IA, and activation of Ih) determines the
propensity, or lack thereof, of repetitive burst firing of TC neurons.
We also have determined the specific roles that each of these variables
have during the intrinsic oscillation.

THE RESTING MEMBRANE PERMEABILITY of neurons defines the
resting membrane potential (RMP) and determines neuronal
excitability. This resting membrane permeability is determined
by ion channels that are active at levels below the threshold for
action potential firing. The molecular identification and biophysical characterization of ion channels in vertebrates has
revealed a large diversity of molecular mechanisms potentially
involved in controlling the membrane behavior at subthreshold
potentials (Hille 2001; Yu and Catterall 2004). Members of

ical properties consistent with activation at subthreshold potentials (Coetzee et al. 1999; Rudy et al. 2009). Similarly,
hyperpolarization-activated cationic channels (HCN) (Biel et
al. 2009), low-threshold calcium channels (Perez-Reyes 2003),
persistent sodium currents (Waxman et al. 2002), and leak
sodium channels (Ren 2011) also operate at subthreshold
potentials. Most neurons express combinations of several of
these ion channels, indicating that the RMP results from the
complex interaction of several subthreshold operating conductances. Yet, the detailed ionic mechanisms that establish and
control the resting membrane permeability of any neuron have
not been described.
The subthreshold ionic mechanisms of thalamocortical (TC)
neurons have been studied extensively due to the physiological
relevance of these neurons and the richness of their membrane
behavior at subthreshold potentials. These cells display two
modes of firing (tonic and bursting) that originate at two
different “resting” potentials and also subthreshold oscillations. Three different conductances have been shown to affect
the subthreshold membrane behavior of these neurons: the
potassium leak current (McCormick 1992), the hyperpolarization-activated cationic current (Ih; McCormick and Pape 1990),
and the low-threshold calcium current (IT; Jahnsen and Llinas
1984). The first two currents control RMP directly, whereas IT
underlies the transient depolarization (low-threshold calcium
spike) over which rides a high-frequency burst of Naϩ action
potentials elicited when the membrane potential is released
from hyperpolarization (rebound burst; Jahnsen and Llinas
1984). In addition, the reciprocal activation of Ih and IT at
hyperpolarized potentials is believed to be the core mechanism
of intrinsic repetitive burst firing (McCormick and Bal 1997).
Other subthreshold operating conductances in TC neurons that
might also contribute to controlling their excitability include an
inwardly rectifying potassium current (IKir; Williams et al.
1997), a persistent sodium current (INaP; Jahnsen and Llinas
1984), and a fast transient A-type potassium current (IA;
Huguenard et al. 1991). However, the contribution of these
conductances to the regulation of the membrane behavior at
subthreshold potentials has not been studied.
With the aim of reconstructing the steady-state conductance
of TC neurons at subthreshold potentials, we combined electrophysiological recordings in brain slices from mice with
computational modeling. We first characterized a strong inwardly rectifying potassium conductance. We then built a
biophysically accurate conductance-based model of TC neurons that reproduces the experimental findings, using results

SUBTHRESHOLD CONDUCTANCES OF THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS

from our recordings and the large amount of information
available on the electrophysiological properties of TC neurons
in rodents. Hodgkin and Huxley (HH)-like models of the
different conductances active at subthreshold potentials for
tonic firing were adjusted and incorporated into the model cell.
By matching our steady-state recordings to simulations performed with the model cell, we determined the maximum
conductance values for each component of the steady-state
conductance and their individual contributions to the TC neuron RMP. To study the role of the subthreshold operating
conductances in the intrinsic oscillatory behavior of TC neurons, we determined the minimal requirements for generation
and maintenance of oscillations compatible with physiological
(or pathological) intrinsic repetitive burst firing. Finally, we
determined the relative contribution of each subthreshold conductance to simulated repetitive bursts by examining their time
course on the subthreshold model. Some of these results have
been presented in abstract form (Amarillo 2007; Amarillo and
Nadal 2011; Amarillo et al. 2005).
METHODS

Slice Preparation and Animals
All experiments were carried out in accordance with the NIH Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by
the New York University School of Medicine Animal Care and Use
Committee. Brain slices were prepared from 2- to 4-wk-old ICR mice.
Following induction of deep anesthesia with pentobarbital sodium
(50 –75 mg/kg ip), mice were decapitated and the brains removed into
an ice-cold oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) that
contained (in mM) 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 Na2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 2
CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 dextrose. The brain was blocked at a coronal
plane, and 350-␮m-thick slices were cut using a manual vibroslicer
(WPI, Sarasota, FL). Slices including the ventrobasal thalamic nuclei
were maintained at room temperature in oxygenated ACSF (95%
CO2-5% O2) until they were transferred to the recording chamber
continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF.
Kir2.2 knockout (KO) mice where obtained from the laboratory of
Dr. Thomas Schwarz (Zaritsky et al. 2001). The original FVB background was re-derivated and subsequently back-crossed to ICR background in the animal facility of New York University School of
Medicine (Skirball Institute).

(with zero current injection) modes before and after drug treatments.
A junction potential of 4 mV was directly measured and corrected
off-line from all command potentials. All recordings were performed
at room temperature unless otherwise stipulated. Drugs were applied
by bath superfusion. The results obtained in the presence of synaptic
activity blockers [in ␮M: 10 CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3dione), 20 APV, and 10 bicuculline] were not significantly different
(data not shown). Recordings were sampled at 20 kHz, acquired on a
personal computer using the pCLAMP8 software (Molecular Devices), and stored for further analysis.
In most of the voltage-clamp recordings performed in this study,
we used a command protocol consisting of a slow voltage ramp at 7.5
mV/s between Ϫ114 and Ϫ54 mV (after junction potential correction). This protocol allowed us to achieve nearly steady-state conditions at every point during the ramp. However, time-dependent
mechanisms were still present in recordings in which Ih was not
eliminated pharmacologically (see RESULTS). Slower ramp protocols
resulted in recording instability.
Data Analysis and Computer Simulations
Continuous current-voltage (I-V) plots were obtained from voltageclamp recordings by replacing time with a linear incremental function
of voltage between the initial and final voltage values of the ramp
protocols used. When data from several cells were pooled together,
data points every 3.75 mV were selected from these continuous I-V
plots for illustration purposes.
IKir characterization and modeling. The barium-sensitive component was obtained by subtracting the ramp current traces before from
those after application of 50 ␮M Ba2ϩ to TC neurons from wild-type
mice (Fig. 1B). Application of higher concentrations of Ba2ϩ did not
produce any additional response in the voltage range analyzed in this
study. Conductance values obtained by dividing the current by the
driving force were plotted against voltage for each cell and fitted to a
single Boltzmann function of the form
gKir(V) ϭ gmin ϩ (gmax Ϫ gmin) ⁄ ͕1 ϩ exp[(V Ϫ V1⁄2) ⁄ k]͖ ,

where gKir(V) is the conductance of the barium-sensitive component at
a given voltage value; gmax and gmin are the maximum and minimum
conductances, respectively; V is the voltage value at every point
during the ramp protocol; V1/2 is the half-activation voltage; and k is
the slope factor. After normalization to the predicted gmax, the mean
conductances were Boltzmann fitted, and the obtained parameter
values were then used to model the Kir current with the following
equation (Fig. 1C):
IKir(V) ϭ ៮gKir · gKir(V) · (V Ϫ EK),

Electrophysiology
Neurons from ventrobasal thalamic nuclei (ventral posterolateral
and ventral posteromedial nucleus) were visualized using a Dage-MTI
camera mounted on a fixed-stage microscope (Olympus BX50WI)
equipped with infrared-differential interference contrast optics. Localization and identity of some cells were confirmed by including
biocytin in the recording pipette, followed by histological processing.
Patch pipettes were made from borosilicate glass in a Sutter P-97
horizontal puller (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) with resistances
between 2 and 5 M⍀ and were filled with an intracellular solution
containing (in mM) 119 CH3KO3S, 12 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 1
EGTA, 10 HEPES, 0.4 Na-GTP, and 2 Mg-ATP, pH 7.4. Neurons
were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA) after stabilization of holding current while in voltageclamp mode (ϳ5 min after whole cell was achieved) and/or after 15
min of stable RMP while in fast current-clamp mode. Voltage-clamp
recordings were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz, pipette capacitance was
canceled, and series resistance (lower than 10 M⍀) was compensated
to the extent possible (typically 60%). To determine RMP, the
amplifier was switched between voltage-clamp and fast current-clamp

potential for potassium (Ϫ99 mV).
The cell was modeled as a single-compartment cylinder with a
length and diameter of 69 ␮m for an approximated total area of 2.0 ϫ
104 ␮m2, assuming a membrane capacitance of 0.88 ␮F/cm2
(Destexhe et al. 1998). The total membrane area was obtained by
dividing the measured input capacitance (168 Ϯ 8.2 pF; range 99 –239
pF; n ϭ 23) by this per-unit-area value. Input membrane capacitance
was measured online in TC neurons from wild-type mice (before
application of any pharmacological agent) using the membrane test
tool of the pCLAMP software. Voltage-clamp simulations were performed using a single-point electrode with an access resistance of 10
M⍀ to mimic the recording conditions. Model simulations were
performed using the NEURON environment (Hines and Carnevale
1997) with a time resolution of 0.025 ms.
Normalized Kir currents were obtained by dividing the measured
currents on each cell by the current calculated at Ϫ150 mV, using
their corresponding maximum conductances obtained with Eq. 1 (Fig.
1D). An ohmic behavior at this potential was assumed due to the

complete saturation of the Boltzmann fits at these voltages. g៮ Kir was
then adjusted in the model to match the average value of the normalized currents (Fig. 1D).
Ih modeling. Pharmacological isolation of Ih was obtained by
subtracting ramp current traces before and after application of 10 ␮M
of the specific Ih blocker ZD-7288 (Tocris, Minneapolis, MN). Because of the slow kinetics of activation of Ih, current traces obtained
with the ramp protocol show time dependence as well as voltage
dependence. To model Ih, we adapted the mathematical formulation of
Ih from guinea pig TC neurons as used by McCormick and Huguenard
(1992) with activation parameters previously obtained in mice (Santoro et al. 2000). Subsequently, we used voltage-clamp simulations in
NEURON of this modeled Ih, adjusting its maximum conductance to
match our experimental recordings. The steady-state activation and
time constant of activation equations used for modeling Ih were

instantaneous activation and slow inactivation kinetics, and thus

of temperature for INaP, a Q10 of 3 was assumed.
IT modeling. We used the previously published mathematical
model of IT (Huguenard and McCormick 1992), as implemented by
Destexhe et al. (1998; https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/, accession no. 279), with modifications introduced to match our ramp
current recordings. An overall depolarizing shift of ϩ6 mV was
applied to match the threshold of activation of the window T current.
An additional hyperpolarizing shift of Ϫ2 mV in the voltage dependence of activation and activation kinetics was necessary to reproduce
the shape of the deflection induced by the window T current on the
ramp traces. The final equations used were

assumed as described previously (Destexhe et al. 1998).
IA and leak currents modeling. The mathematical formulations of
IA and the leak currents from the study of McCormick and Huguenard
were used without modifications (Huguenard and McCormick 1992;
McCormick and Huguenard 1992). The experimentally determined
Q10 of 2.8 (Huguenard et al. 1991) was used for the gating variables
of IA. The reversal potential for the sodium leak current (INaleak) was
set at 0 mV in agreement with the lack of cation selectivity of the
channel subunits that carry this current (Lu et al. 2007; Swayne et al.
2009).
Modeling the conductances generating and controlling spiking. To
model spiking and high-threshold phenomena such as afterhyperpolarizations, the following conductances with biophysical parameters
taken from previous studies were included in the final model. The fast
transient sodium current INa and the delayed rectifier potassium
current IK were modeled as in the study of Destexhe et al. (1998;
https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/, accession no. 279). A global
depolarizing shift of 10 –15 mV was used for these currents to better
match the spiking threshold of our current-clamp recordings. These
kinds of corrections have been used previously to model spiking of
TC neurons (Rhodes and Llinas 2005). Maximum conductances of
1.0 ϫ 10Ϫ2 and 2.0 ϫ 10Ϫ3 S/cm2 were used for INa and IK,
respectively. The high-threshold calcium current IL was implemented as
in the model of McCormick and Huguenard (1992) with the corrections
included in the erratum of that publication (http://huguenard-lab.
stanford.edu/pubs.php) using a maximum permeability of 1.0 ϫ 10Ϫ4
cm/s. Finally, the calcium-activated potassium conductances IKCa and
IKAHP were incorporated into the model by using parameters from
Traub et al. (2003) as implemented by Lazarewicz and Traub in
ModelDB (https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/, accession no.
20756) with a correction factor of 10Ϫ6 to convert their arbitrary units

of calcium concentration to millimoles per liter. Maximum conductances of 1.0 ϫ 10Ϫ4 and 1.5 ϫ 10Ϫ5 S/cm2 were used for IKCa and
IKAHP, respectively. These calcium-sensitive currents were made
dependent on calcium concentration changes resulting from activation
of the high-threshold calcium current IL, but not from IT. Calcium
dynamics were modeled as described previously (McCormick and
Huguenard 1992).
Stacked area plots showing the relative contribution of ionic
conductances (see Fig. 5) or currents (see Figs. 9 and 10) to the total
conductance (current) were obtained by normalizing the absolute
values for each particular conductance (current) at every voltage
(time) point by the total conductance (current) at that point.
RESULTS

A Strong Inward Rectifying Potassium Current Contributes
to the Steady-State Conductance of TC Neurons
The ionic currents of TC neurons recorded under voltage
clamp display inward rectification at negative potentials. As
previously shown, this rectification can be separated into at
least two components with the use of pharmacology: a fast
component sensitive to barium and a slow component sensitive
to the drug ZD-7288 (Williams et al. 1997). The slow component is mediated by the hyperpolarization-activated cationic
current Ih (see below), whereas an inwardly rectifying potassium current (IKir) has been assumed to underlie the fast
component (Williams et al. 1997). Yet, Ikir has not been fully
characterized in these cells, and its role is unknown. To isolate
IKir, we initially used a protocol of hyperpolarizing pulses in
whole cell voltage clamp and application of 50 ␮M Ba2ϩ (see
METHODS) (Fig. 1A). The barium-sensitive component quickly
reached steady state (␶ ϭ 5.7 Ϯ 0.6 ms at Ϫ114 mV; n ϭ 9),
whereas the remaining barium-insensitive component rose very
slowly and did not reach steady state during the duration of the
1-s-long pulse protocol. The fast kinetics of the barium-sensitive component (IKir) allowed us to use a slow ramp protocol
(see METHODS) to eliminate the fast inactivating currents and
thus obtain continuous I-V plots of IKir at steady state. Figure
1B shows recordings from one TC neuron obtained using the
ramp protocol before and after application of 50 ␮M Ba2ϩ, and
the barium-sensitive component obtained by off-line subtraction. The I-V relationship of this barium-sensitive component is
characterized by strong inward rectification, a reversal potential at the predicted Nernst reversal potential for Kϩ (Ϫ99
mV), and a region of negative slope conductance at potentials
positive to about Ϫ85 mV. By fitting the normalized conductance-voltage (G-V) plot to a Boltzmann function, we obtained
a V1/2 of activation of Ϫ97.9 Ϯ 1.17 mV and a slope factor (k)
of 9.7 Ϯ 0.6 mVϪ1 (Fig. 1C). These parameters were then used
to create a mathematical model of IKir that was incorporated
into a blank model cell (without any other conductances) with
dimensions and capacitance resembling those of TC neurons
(see METHODS). Figure 1D shows a simulation of the modeled
Kir current superimposed on the normalized currents recorded
with the ramp protocol. The maximum conductance of the
model was set to 2.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5 S/cm2 to match the normalized
currents. This value is within the range of maximum conductance values obtained by extrapolating values from individual
cells (gmax between 3.4 and 25.3 nS), assuming a membrane
area of 2.0 ϫ 104 ␮m2.
The I-V relationship, the high sensitivity to Ba2ϩ, and the
values used to fit the barium-sensitive component are reminis-

cent of the properties of inward rectifier potassium channels of
the Kir2 family (Anumonwo and Lopatin 2010). In addition,
previous in situ hybridization studies in rodent brain have indicated that the only Kir2 channel mRNA expressed in the thalamus
corresponds to Kir2.2 (Karschin et al. 1996). We tested the
hypothesis that Kir2.2 potassium channels underlie the Kir current
in these neurons by recording TC neurons from Kir2.2 KO mice.
We found that recordings from Kir2.2 KO neurons under
control conditions (without any pharmacological treatment)
differ in their rectification properties from those recorded in
wild-type mice (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, application of 50 ␮M
Ba2ϩ to TC neurons from Kir2.2 KO mice had no effect on the
currents recorded at these potentials, and the I-V curve obtained by subtraction is flat at zero current (Fig. 1F). The I-V
plots that result after pharmacological elimination of other
current components in TC neurons from wild-type and Kir2.2
KO mice (see below) further indicate that Kir2.2 channels are

in TC neurons from mice.

with parameters taken from Wu et al. (2005; see METHODS) was
incorporated into a blank model cell and compared with the
experimental TTX-sensitive component obtained by subtraction. Figure 2C shows the match between the recorded data
from five cells (squares) and the model simulation using a ramp
protocol similar to that used during the experiments (7.5
mV/s). A g៮ NaP value of 5.5 ϫ 10Ϫ6 S/cm2 was used for the
simulation to match the amplitude of the recorded currents.
Ih. Application of 10 ␮M of the Ih blocker ZD-7288 eliminated most of the inward current, especially at potentials
positive to EK (Fig. 2B). The remaining current after blocking
of Ih shows strong inward rectification consistent with the
unmasking of IKir (Fig. 2B). In agreement with the slow
kinetics of Ih, the ZD-7288-sensitive component obtained by
subtraction was unable to follow the slow ramp protocol and
displays complex time dependence (Fig. 2B). However, by
using the data from the study of Santoro et al. (2000) to
recreate a model of Ih from mice (see METHODS), we were able
to reproduce the response of TC neurons to the slow ramp
protocol (Fig. 2C). The g៮ h value used for the simulation (2.2 ϫ
10Ϫ5 S/cm2) is consistent with previous reports (McCormick
and Huguenard 1992; Santoro et al. 2000). This model realistically captures the biophysical behavior of the ZD-7288sensitive current, reproducing both the time course and the
voltage dependence of Ih during the ramp.
The resulting I-V relationship after elimination of IKir, Ih,
and INaP is not linear. Elimination of IKir, Ih, and INaP results in
an incomplete linearization of the I-V relationship obtained
with the ramp protocol, indicating that other players besides
linear leaks also contribute to the steady-state conductance of
TC neurons, especially at potentials positive to about Ϫ80 mV.
Concomitant application of TTX, ZD-7288, and Ba2ϩ to wildtype TC neurons (Fig. 3A), or application of TTX and ZD-7288
to Kir2.2 KO TC neurons (Fig. 3B), resulted in an I-V relationship that is linear at potentials negative to Ϫ82 mV. The
slope of these plots decreases between Ϫ82 and Ϫ70 mV,
where the reversal potential lies, and then increases again at
more positive values.
Leak currents. To reconstruct the nonlinear I-V relationship
that remains after elimination of IKir, Ih, and INaP, we first
incorporated potassium and sodium leak currents (IKleak and
INaleak) into a blank model cell (see METHODS). The g៮ values of

Other Components of the Steady-State Conductance of TC
Neurons
At least six additional currents active at subthreshold potentials can contribute to the subthreshold current recorded in TC
neurons. These are the persistent sodium current INaP, the
hyperpolarization-activated cationic current Ih, the low-threshold activated calcium current IT, the low-threshold transient
potassium current IA, the potassium leak current IKleak, and the
sodium leak current INaleak. We used the selective drugs TTX
and ZD-7288, in combination with computer modeling, to
obtain quantitative measurements of the contribution of INaP
and Ih, respectively. To unveil the contribution of IT, IA, and
leak currents to the steady-state conductance of TC neurons,
we used modeling to match simulations of combined currents
to ramp recordings obtained after elimination of IKir, Ih, and
INaP.
INaP. Application of 300 nM TTX increased the outward
rectification of the I-V curve obtained with the ramp protocol at
potentials positive to Ϫ78 mV (Fig. 2A). The TTX-sensitive
component obtained by subtraction corresponds to INaP, the
persistent sodium current (Fig. 2A), which is not inactivated
during the slow ramp. Subsequently, an HH-like model of INaP

IKleak (1.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5 S/cm2) and INaleak (3.0 ϫ 10Ϫ6 S/cm2) were
adjusted to match the slope and the extrapolated reversal potential
of a linear fit to the average ramp recordings of 10 cells from
Kir2.2 KO mice after application of TTX and ZD-7288. The fit
was performed on the linear region negative to Ϫ84 mV (slope
between Ϫ114 and Ϫ84 mV ϭ 2.53 Ϯ 0.05 pA/mV, corresponding to a membrane resistance of 395.3 M⍀, and with an extrapolated reversal potential of Ϫ76.6 mV) (Fig. 3C).
Window current components of IT and IA. Consistent with a
contribution of a window current component of IT to the
steady-state conductance of TC neurons (Crunelli et al. 2005;
Dreyfus et al. 2010; Perez-Reyes 2003), introduction of this
current into the model cell together with the leaks induces an
N-like deflection of the I-V curve characterized by a region of
decreased slope between Ϫ80 and Ϫ68 mV, followed by an
increase in the slope at potentials positive to Ϫ68 mV (Fig.
3C). On the other hand, incorporation of the transient potassium current IA together with the leaks into the model cell
induces a prominent outward rectification of the I-V plot at
potentials positive to Ϫ77 mV (Fig. 3C). Simulating the
combined steady-state activation of these two currents with the
leaks accurately reproduces the complex I-V relationship that
was observed after elimination of IKir, Ih, and INaP (Fig. 3C).
The maximum conductance for IA (g៮ A ϭ 5.5 ϫ 10Ϫ3 S/cm2)
and maximum permeability for IT (pT ϭ 5.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5 cm/s) are
within the range of values found experimentally (Destexhe et
al. 1998; Huguenard et al. 1991). The nonlinear behavior that
persists after removal of Ih, INaP, and IKir is reproduced by the
fraction of window currents of modeled IA and IT, indicating
that these two window currents contribute to the steady-state
conductance of TC neurons at potentials positive to Ϫ80 mV.

Vm(mV)

Finally, we performed a simulation including all the identified components, using the maximum conductance values established in the preceding sections, and compared it to the
experimentally recorded I-V plots in the absence of pharmacological agents (Fig. 3D); this figure shows a rather precise
correspondence between the simulation and the experimental
data. This computational reconstruction indicates that the subthreshold conductance of TC neurons is composed by at least
seven different ion currents: IKleak, INaleak, Ih, IKir, IT, INaP, and
IA, and that the modeled biophysical properties of these currents can account for the complex nonlinearity observed
experimentally.
Computational Reconstruction of the Steady-State
Conductance of TC Neurons
To determine the contribution of each individual component
to the steady-state conductance, we performed simulations of
the I-V relationship at steady-state (i.e., with all the gates set at
infinite time values), with all the seven currents switched on
and in the presence of each one of them at a time. Figure 4A
shows a comparison of the steady-state I-V relationships of the
seven subthreshold conductances at physiologically relevant
subthreshold potentials, highlighting their differential voltagedependent contributions to the total steady-state current
(black). The main determinants of the RMP (the reversal
potential of the total I-V curve) in these neurons, determined as
fractions of the total current, are the leak conductances gKleak
and gNaleak (36.7% and 24.5% of the total conductance, respectively). The other contributing conductances (in decreasing
order) are gT (11.2%), gA (10.7%), gNaP (7.5%), gh (5.8%), and
gKir (3.5%) (Fig. 4B). It is worth noting that these percent

(RMP), at which the algebraic sum of inward (tones of red and yellow) and

contributions do not reflect the importance of each current. As
we show below, each of these conductances plays a key role at
specific times during the oscillatory behavior of TC neurons.
For example, even gKir, which makes the smallest contribution,
becomes the most important conductance during interburst
periods.
Contribution of the Steady-State Conductance Components
to the RMP of TC Neurons
To verify the individual contribution of each conductance
component to the RMP of TC cells, we switched each of these
conductances on and off in the model TC neuron (Fig. 5) and
contrasted these results with values of RMP obtained before

399

and after pharmacological elimination of those currents in TC
cells (Table 1). Simulations with and without spiking mechanisms produced similar values of RMP (see DISCUSSION).
We tested the effect of blocking IKleak on RMP of TC
neurons by applying the muscarinic receptor agonist ␤-methylcholine (MCh). Application of 1 mM MCh in the absence of
any other drug induced a strong depolarization that was sufficient to generate spontaneous firing in three cells tested (not
shown). After elimination of sodium spiking with 300 nM
TTX, MCh induced a significantly large change in RMP: from
Ϫ68.6 Ϯ 2.5 to Ϫ55 Ϯ 2.5 mV (n ϭ 7; paired t-test, P ϭ
0.00003) (Table 1). In contrast, elimination of IKleak in the
model after INa and INaP were turned off produced a smaller
depolarization to Ϫ62.3 mV. In the presence of active sodium
conductances, elimination of IKleak depolarized the model cell
to Ϫ56.8 mV without reaching firing threshold. This discrepancy could be explained by the lack of selectivity of MCh at
blocking IKleak. In addition to blocking potassium leak channels, MCh is a nonselective muscarinic agent that produces a
broad spectrum of cellular effects. For example, Zhu and
Uhlrich (1998) observed that application of MCh to rat TC
neurons not only blocked a potassium leak conductance but
also increased an inward current that was suspected to be Ih.
Recent investigations have demonstrated that channels that
carry sodium leak are also activated by second messengerdependent mechanisms, including signaling cascades activated
by muscarinic receptors (Lu et al. 2009; Swayne et al. 2009).
Thus MCh could be acting on both IKleak (blocking) and INaleak
(activating) to produce a synergistic depolarizing effect on
RMP. We were able to simulate this effect in the model cell: an
amount of depolarization sufficient to reach firing threshold
was obtained after IKleak was turned off and g៮ Naleak was
increased by 30%, an effect consistent with previous observations (Lu et al. 2009; Swayne et al. 2009).
We then performed a similar analysis with the other conductances. There is a consistent agreement between the effect
that changing the maximum conductance of the different components of the steady-state conductance has on the RMP of the
TC neuron model and the effect that selective pharmacological
agents have on the RMP of real TC neurons (Table 1). Table 1
also shows the agreement between RMP values of TC neurons
from KO mice of Kir2.2 and HCN2 channel subunits, with the
RMP values obtained after the simulated elimination of IKir and
Ih, respectively. Figure 5 summarizes the simulated effect of
eliminating each subthreshold conductance on RMP and the
consequent reconfiguration of the remaining conductances.
The Model Reproduces the Firing Behavior of Rodent TC
Neurons
One of the most prominent features of TC neurons is the
ability to fire action potentials in two different modes depending on the level of the membrane potential at which the
depolarizing stimulus occurs (Llinas and Jahnsen 1982). To
assess whether the modeled steady-state conductance would
uphold the complex firing behavior of TC neurons, we fed the
model with mechanisms that enable fast sodium-mediated
action potential firing (see METHODS). Both the model and the
TC neurons recorded under current clamp displayed the typical
tonic firing and rebound burst responses when stimulated with
a square pulse of current from a depolarized holding potential

respectively (Fig. 6, A and B). In addition, decreasing (or
increasing) the maximum conductance of IKleak in the model
TC neuron was sufficient to disable (or enable) the mechanism
of low-threshold spike (LTS) generation. This is in agreement
with the proposed role of this current in mediating the neuro-

modulator-dependent switch between bursting and tonic firing
modes in TC neurons (McCormick and Bal 1997; McCormick
and Prince 1987). Thus a depolarizing current applied after
g៮ Kleak is increased (which causes hyperpolarization and deinactivation of IT) results in the generation of an LTS and burst
firing, whereas a similar depolarizing step after g៮ Kleak is de-

elicits a tonic train of action potentials (Fig. 6, C and D;
compare with Fig. 9 of McCormick and Prince 1987).
Inducing Intrinsic Periodic Burst Firing in the Rodent TC
Neuron Model
Repetitive burst firing of TC neurons has been linked to the
expression of the rhythms that characterize slow-wave sleep
(particularly oscillations in the delta frequency band) (Dossi et
al. 1992; Steriade and Deschenes 1984) and the pathological
spike and wave discharges of absence epilepsy (Paz et al. 2007;
Steriade and Contreras 1995). Although the synchronized expression of repetitive burst firing of TC neurons in the behaving animal is the result of the interaction between their intrinsic
properties with the synaptic activity of all the cellular elements
of the thalamo-reticulo-cortical network (Destexhe and Sejnowski 2003; Lytton et al. 1996), experimental evidence
indicates a prominent role of intrinsic ionic mechanisms in the
generation and maintenance of the oscillations at the cellular
level (McCormick and Pape 1990).
Most rodent TC neurons recorded in brain slices are unable
to sustain repetitive burst firing in isolation (McCormick and
Pape 1990; McCormick and Prince 1988). In agreement with
these experimental observations, our TC neuron model is
unable to sustain repetitive burst firing with the default set of
parameters used in the reconstruction of the steady-state conductance (Fig. 7A). It is possible to induce the appearance of
rhythmic burst firing in rodent brain slices by manipulating the
concentration of extracellular divalent cations (Jacobsen et al.
2001; Leresche et al. 1991). The underlying cause of the

dependence of the oscillatory activity on the ionic environment
is unknown. It was shown using dynamic clamp that the
conductance of IT must exceed a certain threshold in order for
TC neurons to exhibit spontaneous rhythmic activity (Hughes
et al. 2009). Previous modeling studies (McCormick and Huguenard 1992; Wang et al. 1991) showed that the ability of TC
neuron models to fire bursts of action potentials periodically
could be achieved by increasing the availability of the lowthreshold calcium current IT. We investigated which specific
adjustments in the parameters of IT and the other subthreshold
conductances enable repetitive burst firing in TC neurons.
We found that all of the following parameter modifications
introduced independently (one at a time) enabled the model to
continuously discharge LTSs at low frequencies (below 3 Hz),
which are crowned by high-frequency bursts of action potentials: 1) increasing the maximum permeability of IT from 5.0 ϫ
10Ϫ5 cm/s to values higher than 8.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5 cm/s (Fig. 7B), 2)
applying a global negative shift to the activation variable of IT
larger than Ϫ2 mV (Fig. 7C), 3) applying a global positive shift
to the inactivation variable of IT larger than ϩ3 mV (Fig. 7D),
4) decreasing the maximum conductance of IA below 2.1 ϫ
10Ϫ3 S/cm2 (Fig. 7E), 5) increasing the maximum conductance
of INaP above 1.5 ϫ 10Ϫ5 S/cm2 (Fig. 7F), and 6) increasing
the maximum conductance of IKir above 1.0 ϫ 10Ϫ4 S/cm2
(Fig. 7G). Modification of the maximum conductance of Ih
alone did not support periodic burst firing. After each one of
these modifications was introduced, the level of depolarization
or hyperpolarization required to induce oscillations was obtained by injecting DC current or, alternatively, by modifying
the leak conductances within certain values (see below).

oscillations (Fig. 8A, first 3 traces). Increasing pT to 7.0 ϫ
10Ϫ5 cm/s induced spontaneous oscillations of 32 mV of
amplitude (negative and positive peaks at Ϫ68 and Ϫ36 mV,
respectively) at 2.3 Hz (Fig. 8A, 4th trace). Similarly, introducing a hyperpolarizing shift in the activation gate of IT larger
than Ϫ2 mV or a depolarizing shift in the inactivation gate
larger than ϩ2 mV enabled oscillations (Fig. 8A, 5th and 6th
traces, respectively). These simulations indicate that the amplifying variable mT and the resonant variable hT are sufficient
to generate low-threshold oscillations in the delta band. Notably, the adjustments required to enable the oscillatory behavior
are small and physiologically plausible (see DISCUSSION).

From a theoretical perspective, the only requirement for
generating neuronal oscillations (repetitive action potential
firing, subthreshold oscillations, or resonance phenomena) is
the appropriated combination of an amplifying variable and a
resonant (or recovering) variable in the presence of an ohmic
leak (Hutcheon and Yarom 2000; Izhikevich 2005). To determine the minimal requirements that enable sustained lowthreshold oscillations in TC neurons compatible with physiological repetitive burst firing in the delta band (or pathological
spike and wave discharges of absence epilepsy), we systematically performed simulations with the model cell containing
only pairs of amplifying and resonant variables (or currents)
together with the leaks. We started by investigating the ability
of the low-threshold calcium current IT to sustain periodic
low-threshold oscillations by itself. In the absence of all
currents except IT and the leak currents, and with the use of the
default parameters (pT ϭ 5.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5 cm/s; g៮ Kleak ϭ 1.0 ϫ
10Ϫ5 S/cm2; g៮ Naleak ϭ 3.0 ϫ 10Ϫ6 S/cm2; and leak reversal

Next, we explored whether there is a minimal TC model for
generating sustained low-threshold oscillations compatible
with repetitive bursting that does not require the low threshold
calcium current IT. Charles Wilson proposed a model to explain the spontaneous burst firing of cholinergic interneurons in
the striatum based on the interaction between Ih and IKir
(Wilson 2005). In agreement with that model, turning on Ih and
IKir in the presence of the leak currents bestows the TC model
cell with periodic oscillatory activity. For example, we obtained sustained oscillations (26.5 mV of amplitude at a frequency of 1.6 Hz, Fig. 8B) with g៮ h increased to 4.4 ϫ 10Ϫ5 and
g៮ Kir increased to 3.0 ϫ 10Ϫ4 S/cm2 (while keeping the maximum conductance for the leaks at the default values). In
contrast to the oscillations based on IT (Fig. 8A), the oscillations generated by the interaction of IKir and Ih are elicited by
injecting depolarizing current and occur in a more negative
voltage regime.
We also tested other combinations of subthreshold currents
that could sustain periodic oscillations in the model without
modifying parameters other than maximum conductance. Interestingly, turning on IA and INaP, in the presence of only the
leak currents enables the model cell to oscillate. Figure 8C
shows oscillations at 0.7 Hz obtained (without injecting current) with g៮ A set to 3.0 ϫ 10Ϫ3 S/cm2, g៮ NaP set to 3.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5
S/cm2, and the leak currents set to default.

To study the contribution to repetitive burst firing of each of
the seven subthreshold conductances described for TC neurons, we analyzed systematically the time course of the currents and the gating variables during periodic LTSs. First, we
analyzed the time course of the currents during oscillations
enabled by increasing the availability of IT (we used the
minimum pT value that sustains periodic LTSs: 8.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5
cm/s) while maintaining the g៮ values of the other conductances
at their default values (Fig. 9). Under these conditions, we then
analyzed the effect of eliminating (turning off) each of the
conductances on the oscillatory behavior of the model (Fig. 10,
A–C). Finally, we analyzed the behavior of the currents during
oscillations enabled by modifying the g៮ values of all the other
conductances but IT (pT ϭ 5.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5 cm/s; Fig. 10, D–F).
Since we did not find qualitative differences when including
spiking mechanisms [albeit the values of maximum conductance required to induce periodic oscillations are slightly lower
in their presence (Fig. 7) than in their absence (Fig. 10, D–F)],
the following simulations were performed in the absence of
suprathreshold conductances (see DISCUSSION).
After pT is increased to 8.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5 cm/s and in the absence
of current injection, the membrane potential of the model cell
is stable at Ϫ67.7 mV. All simulations in this section started at
this RMP of Ϫ67.7 mV to provide similar initial conditions for
all voltage-dependent variables of the model. Under these
initial conditions, injection of hyperpolarizing current elicits
repetitive LTSs (Fig. 9, 1st trace) at a frequency that changes
little with the magnitude of the current injected (from 1.6 to 1.9
Hz). The traces in Fig. 9 (2nd to 9th) show the time course of
the different currents and of the gating variables of IT during
two cycles elicited by injecting the minimum current required
to induce the oscillation (Ϫ12 pA). Figure 9 shows the sequence of events underlying the oscillations: at the most

conditions as in Fig. 9, data in A–C show the time course of the gating variables of IT and the relative contribution of the currents during spontaneous oscillations
of the TC neuron model (colored stacked area plots) in the absence of Ih (A), during dampening oscillations of the TC model in the absence of IKir (B), and during

cycle progresses. After this point, the contribution of Ih decreases rapidly at the same time that IT becomes the dominant
inward component. The regenerative activation of IT then
slowly depolarizes the membrane toward the LTS threshold
(dotted vertical line c in Fig. 9), at which the sudden upstroke
of the LTS occurs. During this time, the simultaneous activation of IA and INaP has opposing effects on the depolarizing
drive of IT: IA negative and INaP positive. At the peak of the
LTS (vertical dotted line a in Fig. 9), the total inward current
is completely counterbalanced by the large contribution of IA

(28% of the total current) and the large driving force of the
potassium leak current. During the repolarizing phase of the
LTS, IT decreases to a minimum due to its almost complete
inactivation. At this time, the contribution of INaP is maximal
but is nonetheless outweighed by the potassium leak and IA. At
the end of the repolarizing phase, the membrane potential
hyperpolarizes toward the most negative point of the oscillation assisted by the unblock of IKir, which becomes the dominant outward current during most of the inter-LTS interval,
despite its small magnitude (Fig. 9, 5th trace). This hyperpo-

SUBTHRESHOLD CONDUCTANCES OF THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS

larization, in turn, initiates the next cycle by activating Ih and
removing the inactivation of IT.
Ih. Surprisingly, after Ih is switched off (with pT increased to
8.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5 cm/s), the model is still capable of sustaining
periodic LTSs (36-mV amplitude at 1.2 Hz) in the absence of
current injection (Fig. 10A). Under these conditions, the net
total current at the most hyperpolarized point of the oscillation
is zero (vertical dotted line b) due to the complete balance of
inward (mostly IT) and outward (mostly IKir) currents. Beyond
this point, the inward current becomes dominant by the regenerative increase of IT, which produces the upstroke of the LTS
on its own accord. During the peak and the repolarization of
the LTS, the trajectory (albeit not the scale) of the other
currents is similar to the condition where Ih is present, because
this current is nonetheless deactivated at this point (Fig. 9).
IKir. With the model set to the conditions that enable oscillations (pT increased to 8.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5 cm/s and all other parameters set to their default values), switching off IKir prevents the
maintenance of repetitive LTS. By using the optimum current
injection (Ϫ20 pA), the model is capable of generating a
maximum of seven cycles before declining to a stable potential
(Ϫ71 mV). Slightly lower, or higher, current magnitudes
generate a lower number of cycles. Inspection of the time
course of the gates of IT as the oscillation progresses reveals a
gradual decline in the availability of IT (mT2hT product) due to
a progressive drop in the deinactivation during the inter-LTS
intervals (Fig. 10B). This suggests that the additional hyperpolarizing drive, timely provided by IKir during inter-LTS
intervals, optimizes the fine balance of inactivation-activation
of IT that underlies sustained oscillations.
IA. Switching off IA under similar conditions of increased
availability of IT (pT ϭ 8.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5 cm/s) induces a large
depolarization (RMP stabilizes at Ϫ54.8 mV without current
injection). Injection of hyperpolarizing current induces the
appearance of sustained repetitive LTSs characterized by larger
amplitudes (Fig. 10C, top trace). Comparison of current magnitudes before and after IA is switched off shows about 50%
increase of peak T current for any given current injection.
Furthermore, the maximum contribution of IT to the total
current increases from 59% to 80% during LTSs after IA is
switched off (compare the stacked area plots of Figs. 9 and
10C, vertical lines c), indicating that IA counteracts the surge of
IT and hence controls the amplitude of the LTS.
INaP. Similar to the effect of eliminating IKir, turning off INaP
prevents repetitive LTS generation at all values of current
injection (not shown). The negatively shifted activation of INaP
(with respect to transient sodium current) boosts depolarization
during the initial phase of the LTS, when the membrane
potential rushes toward the threshold of rapid regenerative
activation of IT (see Fig. 8). The minimum g៮ NaP value that
allows repetitive LTSs while maintaining the other conductances at their default value (pT ϭ 8.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5 cm/s) is 2.8 ϫ
10Ϫ6 S/cm2.
Leak currents. As expected, turning off IKleak produces a
large depolarization. This can be overcome by injecting
enough hyperpolarizing current to bring the membrane potential to the level of activation of IT, inducing repetitive LTSs.
Reciprocally, oscillations are induced by injecting depolarizing
current to the level of activation of IT after INaleak is turned off,
which hyperpolarizes the model cell to Ϫ77.1 mV. The model
is able to sustain repetitive LTSs by using g៮ Kleak values

405

between 0 and 1.2 ϫ 10Ϫ5 S/cm2 while maintaining g៮ Naleak at
the default value (after adjusting the level of current injection).
Similarly, g៮ Naleak values between 0 and 5.0 ϫ 10Ϫ6 S/cm2 also
support periodic LTSs while maintaining g៮ Kleak at default. In
fact, any g៮ leak combination (g៮ Kleak ϩ g៮ Naleak) below 1.5 ϫ 10Ϫ5
S/cm2 supports sustained oscillations. In contrast, above this
value, it is not possible to induce oscillations even if the
hyperpolarizing drive of a large g៮ Kleak (or the depolarizing
drive of a large g៮ Naleak) is compensated by current injection.
This highlights the importance of the electrotonic compactness
of TC neurons. Indeed, we observed a direct relationship
between g៮ leak and the minimum pT value required to induce
oscillations. For example, elimination of both leak currents
allows oscillations with pT values as low as 4.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5 cm/s;
conversely, oscillations are rescued by increasing pT when
using large values of g៮ leak.
Oscillations induced using the default maximum permeability of IT. As mentioned earlier, when the maximum permeability of IT is maintained at the default value (5.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5 cm/s),
increasing the maximum conductance of IKir above 1.0 ϫ 10Ϫ4
S/cm2, decreasing the maximum conductance of IA below
2.1 ϫ 10Ϫ3 S/cm2, or increasing the maximum conductance of
INaP above 1.5 ϫ 10Ϫ5 S/cm2 enables sustained repetitive burst
firing. In this section we examine the mechanisms of repetitive
LTS induced by these manipulations of g៮ on the reduced model
(without spiking mechanisms) while keeping pT at the default
value.
IKir. Under these default conditions, increasing g៮ Kir to values
equal to, or above, 1.2 ϫ 10Ϫ4 S/cm2 enables the generation of
sustained repetitive LTSs. This increase in the availability of
IKir hyperpolarizes the membrane potential to Ϫ78 mV. Oscillations are then induced by application of compensatory depolarizing current (Fig. 10D). In this case, the hyperpolarizing
drive of a large IKir pulls down the membrane potential to a
level at which Ih becomes strongly activated at the same time
that the inactivation of IT is largely removed (vertical dotted
line b in Fig. 10D). Activation of Ih, in turn, depolarizes the
membrane toward the voltage range at which IT becomes
activated. Thus, under these conditions of low availability of
IT, oscillations do not result from the interaction of the amplifying and resonant gates of IT alone. Instead, the interaction of
the amplifying activation of IKir with the recovering activation
of Ih results in a negative transient deflection of the membrane
potential between LTSs, thereby removing the inactivation of
IT. Hence, the complete cycle is composed of a transient
hyperpolarization (mediated by IKir-Ih, between vertical lines a
and c in Fig. 10D), followed by a depolarizing LTS (mediated
by IT, between vertical lines c and d).
IA and INaP. Despite their different kinetics, these two
opposing currents increase with similar time courses during the
initial phase of depolarization, before the upstroke of the LTS.
In the model with all subthreshold conductances set to default,
it is not possible to elicit sustained repetitive LTSs, which are
otherwise enabled by increasing pT to values higher than 8.0 ϫ
10Ϫ5 s/cm. Under these conditions, the magnitude of the A
current in the initial phase is larger than that of INaP (see Fig.
8), and the net combined influence of this pair of currents
timely opposes depolarization. When pT is decreased back to
default (pT ϭ 5.0 ϫ 10Ϫ5 s/cm), the counteracting influence of
IA effectively thwarts the oscillatory behavior. In this case,
repetitive LTSs can be generated by either decreasing g៮ A below

1.8 ϫ 10Ϫ3 S/cm2 (Fig. 10E) or increasing g៮ NaP above 1.7 ϫ
10Ϫ5 S/cm2 (Fig. 10F). Hence, a small change in the balance of
these two currents favoring the amplifying activation of INaP
promotes periodicity by boosting the activation of IT, whereas
an excess of IA current suppresses the oscillation.
DISCUSSION

In this study we present a comprehensive analysis of the
interaction among seven different conductances operating at
membrane potentials below the threshold for tonic action
potential firing in somatosensory TC neurons (ventroposteromedial and ventroposterolateral nuclei) of mice. Our computational analysis shows how this interaction dynamically controls the RMP of these cells, and hence their excitability. We
also explore the mechanisms of generation and maintenance of
low-threshold oscillations compatible with the intrinsic oscillatory activity in the delta band that has been linked to
physiological and pathological EEG rhythms.
We modeled the subthreshold behavior of TC neurons using
a single-compartment model cell that does not include information about the complex geometry of these neurons or the
subcellular distribution of ion channels. Although the subcellular compartmentalization of the conductances analyzed in
this study could have an unforeseen impact on the conclusions
reached in our study (for example, see Wei et al. 2011;
Zomorrodi et al. 2008), the fact that the model cell reproduces
the electrophysiological behavior of TC neurons indicates that
either the high electrotonic compactness of TC cells allows for an
effective space-clamp control of a large membrane area or, alternatively, the modeled parameters capture most of the inaccuracies
of recording in the soma. In any case, the simplification is
validated from a phenomenological perspective, whereas further
investigation is required to clarify the functional effect of subcellular localization, which is largely unknown. In that regard,
ongoing research in our group is being carried out to computationally explore the consequences of compartmentalization of the
conductances analyzed in this article.
The agreement between simulations and experimental traces
indicates that most of the key players of the steady-state
conductance of TC neurons are included in our analysis. This
conclusion is also supported by data on ion channel mRNA
expression in TC neurons. Based on these data and on functional studies, other ion channels expressed by TC neurons that
could contribute, albeit minimally, to the steady-state conductance in the voltage range considered in this study include the
negatively activated slow potassium channels of the KCNQ
and ether-a`-go-go (EAG) families and the calcium-activated
potassium channels. All KCNQ and EAG channels are weakly
expressed in thalamic ventrobasal nuclei with the exception of
Kcnq3 channels (Saganich et al. 2001). However, in agreement
with previous studies (Kasten et al. 2007; McCormick 1992),
our results suggest that their contribution in the subthreshold
voltage range is negligible.
On the basis of pharmacological experiments, calcium-activated potassium channels are known to account for AHP
potentials and to be involved in controlling tonic firing frequency in TC neurons (Jahnsen and Llinas 1984; Kasten et al.
2007). Consequently, most computational models of TC neurons include one or two calcium-activated potassium currents
(McCormick and Huguenard 1992; Rhodes and Llinas 2005).

In contrast to the established role of channels of the smallconductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel family
in controlling the oscillatory behavior of thalamic reticular
neurons (Cueni et al. 2008), indirect experimental evidence
indicates that these channels do not contribute to either RMP or
rhythmic bursting of TC neurons. For instance, application of
neither SK channel blockers nor large-conductance calciumactivated potassium (BK) channel blockers modified the resting membrane conductance of TC neurons (Kasten et al. 2007).
In addition, these same blockers only modify slightly the
number of action potentials within a burst, without modifying
the bursting propensity of TC neurons from tree shrew (Wei et
al. 2011). We performed simulations in the presence or absence
of spiking mechanisms that included two calcium-activated
potassium currents, and we did not observe any qualitative
difference in the conductance control of the RMP or propensity
to fire bursts rhythmically.
The Complex Interplay of Subthreshold Conductances
Controls Both the RMP and the Intrinsic Oscillatory
Behavior of TC Neurons
On the basis of the time course and voltage range of
operation of the seven subthreshold conductances, and how
modifications of single parameters of these currents shift the
propensity of the TC neuron model to either oscillate or get
stabilized at RMP, we propose a model to explain the electrophysiological behavior of TC neurons at subthreshold potentials for tonic firing (Fig. 11). The model includes three
resonant (recovering) variables: hT and the activation of IA
recover the membrane potential from depolarization, whereas
activation of Ih recovers the membrane potential from hyperpolarization; and three amplifying variables: mT and the activation of INaP amplify depolarization, whereas unblocking of
IKir amplifies hyperpolarization. All these currents interact over
the background provided by the leak conductances. In TC
neurons, the densities of these leak conductances are small,
which is important for their control of the RMP. A small leak
(large input resistance) enhances the physiological effects of
the voltage-dependent conductances, which are also small.
Likewise, small variations in leak produced by the modulation
of the leak channels also have a great functional impact, like
the one observed during the neuromodulator-induced transition
from burst to tonic firing in these cells. Under these electrotonically compact conditions, the RMP of TC cells is about 10
mV depolarized from the reversal potential of the leak (Eleak).
This deviation from Eleak is due to the steady activation of the
depolarizing variables (Ih, INaP, and mT; left quadrants in Fig.
11). In turn, the steady activation of the repolarizing variables
(IA, IKir, and hT; right quadrants in Fig. 11) prevents this
depolarization from becoming regenerative. It is the balance
between these counteracting influences that establishes the
RMP. This balance is dynamic, and small modifications can set
in motion the oscillatory behavior of TC neurons.
Indeed, the dynamic balance between amplifying and resonant variables is responsible for the TC neurons’ ability, or
lack thereof, to oscillate intrinsically. Intrinsic oscillations
(spontaneous or induced by injection of constant current) are
enabled if the amplifying variables are allowed to become
regenerative by opposing resonant variables of the right magnitude (i.e., strong enough to fulfill their recovering function of

Fig. 11. Schematic representation of the interaction between the 7 subthreshold
conductances and their roles in controlling the RMP and the oscillatory behavior
of TC neurons. The leak conductances establish a background on which the other
5 voltage-dependent conductances interact: steadily active depolarizing variables
(left quadrants) displace the membrane potential from the reversal potential (E) of
the leak at the same time that steadily active hyperpolarizing variables (right
quadrants) counteract depolarization. The RMP is a stable equilibrium (horizontal
bar) reached by the balance achieved among all these forces. Periodicity is
promoted by changes in certain parameter values that allow the destabilization of
this equilibrium and the cyclic behavior of the membrane potential (curved
arrows). Changes that favor the regenerative activation of the amplifying variables
(black) increase the propensity to oscillate. These changes include either increasing
the magnitude of amplifying variables themselves or decreasing the magnitude of
resonant variables (gray). Conversely, an increase in the magnitude of resonant
variables (and/or a decrease in the magnitude of amplifying variables) renders the
model unable to oscillate periodically.

pulling the membrane potential back toward RMP). Conversely, oscillations are impeded if the resonant variables are
so large that the regenerative activation of amplifying variables
is thwarted (Fig. 11). Consistent with this model, our simulations show that 1) increasing the amplifying variable mT (either
by increasing pT or by displacing its voltage dependence
opposite to that of hT), increases the propensity to oscillate,
whereas decreasing mT hampers oscillations; 2) increasing
amplifying INaP augments the propensity to oscillate, whereas
decreasing INaP opposes oscillations; 3) a large amplifying IKir
increases the propensity to oscillate, whereas a small one
decreases it; 4) decreasing resonant IA increases the propensity
to oscillate, whereas increasing IA prevents oscillations; and 5)
under conditions of increased IT and in the absence of current
injection, decreasing resonant Ih induces oscillations, whereas
increasing Ih promotes stabilization. Except for the first one,
the other model predictions are novel and reveal a far more
complex modulation of the subthreshold behavior of the TC
neuron membrane potential. The specific roles of these currents
in establishing RMP and enabling oscillations in TC neurons
are discussed in detail below.
IT: The Amplifying Variable mT and the Resonant Variable hT
Repetitive burst firing is enabled in the TC neuron model
(tuned to reproduce the murine steady-state conductance) by
increasing the availability of IT, which is consistent with

407

previous observations (Hughes et al. 2009; Noebels 2012; Wei
et al. 2011). We show that a minimal model containing only IT
and the leaks is capable of sustaining periodic oscillations (Fig.
7A). This model predicts that IT alone, with physiologically
plausible parameter values, could originate the oscillatory
behavior of TC neurons. This tendency to oscillate is inherent
to the dynamic interplay between the amplifying variable mT
and the resonant variable hT. Preliminary results in our group
indicate that the bifurcation structure of the minimal IT-leaks
model is similar to the structure of the HH model and that the
two gating variables of IT are perfectly fitted for the pacemaker
function of TC cells (Amarillo Y, Mato G, and Nadal MS,
personal communication; see also Rush and Rinzel 1994).
Nonetheless, as discussed below, in real TC neurons this
intrinsic oscillatory property of IT is modulated by the other
subthreshold operating ionic conductances.
In addition to the contribution of low-threshold calcium
currents to the generation of rhythmic oscillations and LTSs,
their biophysical properties predict the expression of window
currents at low membrane potentials (Crunelli et al. 2005;
Perez-Reyes 2003). Consequently, these window currents
could contribute to the establishment and control of RMP.
Indeed, the expression of a window T current and its contribution to the steady-state conductance of TC neurons have
been demonstrated using a novel selective blocker of calcium
channels of the Cav3 subfamily (Dreyfus et al. 2010). In
agreement with that study, we report in this article a moderate
contribution of the T window current to the RMP of TC
neurons (Fig. 4B and Fig. 5, “IT off”).
Amplifying INaP
Pharmacological blockade of sodium channels produces a
small but significant hyperpolarization of TC neurons (Table
1), indicating a contribution of a persistent sodium current (or
sodium current that is active at steady state) to the RMP of
these cells. Consisting with this finding, persistent sodium
currents from different neuronal types, including TC neurons
(Parri and Crunelli 1998), start to activate at potentials as
negative as Ϫ80 mV and have a V1/2 of activation about 20 mV
more negative than that of transient sodium currents (Wu et al.
2005 and references therein).
The study by Parri and Crunelli (1998) also shows a contribution of INaP to the amplification of rebound LTSs in TC
neurons from rat. In our simulations, the time course and the
relative contribution of INaP during oscillations (Figs. 9 and 10)
indicate that INaP activates during the ascending phase of
repetitive LTSs and adds to the depolarizing drive of the
regenerative activation of IT. In line with this amplifying
effect, increasing INaP is sufficient to enable periodic bursting
(while the other subthreshold conductances are kept at their
default values, Figs. 7E and 10F). Moreover, switching off INaP
abolishes the oscillatory behavior when the default parameter
values are used for all conductances except IT (availability
increased). To recover the oscillation under the latter conditions, the maximum permeability of IT needs to be increased
further (above 9 ϫ 10Ϫ5 cm/s) or the maximum conductance of
IA should be decreased about 20% (below 4 ϫ 10Ϫ3 S/cm2).
This indicates that INaP is not essential for the oscillation;
however, it could have a strong effect depending on the
availability of other subthreshold conductances. In particular,

SUBTHRESHOLD CONDUCTANCES OF THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS

the balance between INaP and IA seems to play a role on the
expression (or suppression) of rhythmic burst firing (Fig. 10, E
and F) and could explain the propensity or failure to sustain
repetitive burst firing of individual TC neurons (see also
Resonant IA below).
Amplifying IKir
Strong inward rectifier potassium channels of the Kir2 family (which underlie IKir in TC neurons) show a distinctive
negative slope conductance region in the I-V relationship
(Dhamoon et al. 2004; Lopatin and Nichols 2001; see also Fig.
1, A and D). It has been suggested that this biophysical feature
could generate bistability and oscillations (Tourneur 1986). In
fact, it has been proposed that the interaction between the
amplifying unblock of IKir and the resonant activation of Ih is
responsible for the rhythmic bursting behavior of cholinergic
interneurons in the striatum (Wilson 2005). Early investigations on the mechanisms of repetitive burst firing in TC
neurons showed that deactivation of Ih during the burst produces an afterhyperpolarization that follows each burst and that
is crucial for the maintenance of the oscillation (McCormick
and Pape 1990). We show in the present work that this
afterhyperpolarization results not only from the deactivation of
Ih but also from the activation (unblock) of IKir during the
repolarizing phase of the LTS. This mechanism differs from
the repolarizing effect of the leaks in that the conductance of
IKir increases as the membrane repolarizes due to the negative
slope conductance. The repolarizing effect of the leaks is nonetheless minimal at the valleys because at these points the membrane potential is very close to the reversal potential of the total
leak. Taking all this together, the “undershoot” between LTSs,
below the reversal potential for the leaks, is produced by the
timely activation of IKir. This extra hyperpolarization in turn
contributes to the maintenance of the oscillation by allowing a
larger removal of inactivation of IT and also by activating Ih.
Resonant IA
The expression of large A-type currents that activate at
negative potentials in TC neurons predicts a contribution of
this current to RMP and burst firing (Huguenard et al. 1991). In
this report we show that IA is active at rest (window current)
and during repetitive burst firing. IA exerts an opposing effect
to LTS generation by counteracting the development of the T
current. In addition, when IT is large enough to overcome this
opposition, IA curtails the amplitude of the LTSs. These findings agree with those of previous investigations (Gutierrez et
al. 2001; Rush and Rinzel 1994). Interestingly, IA develops
during the initial phase of depolarization of each cycle of the
oscillation with similar time course and reaches magnitudes
roughly similar to those of INaP such that these two currents
counterbalance each other. Although the relative contribution
of these currents during this phase is small (see the relative
contribution plot in Fig. 9), changes in their balance favoring
amplifying INaP over resonant IA enable oscillations, whereas
changes in the opposite direction prevent periodicity (Fig. 10,
E and F). This balance between INaP and IA could provide yet
another control mechanism for the oscillatory behavior of TC
neurons, which could also have an impact on the expression of
physiological or pathological thalamocortical rhythms.

On the other hand, our reconstruction of the steady-state conductance of TC neurons indicates that Ih and IA have roughly
similar contributions to the steady-state conductance at equilibrium (rest) and that these contributions increase symmetrically
around RMP (for example, at Ϫ10 mV from rest, Ih contributes
34.8% of the total conductance, whereas at ϩ10 mV from rest, IA
contributes 33.9% of the total conductance; Fig. 5, “all on”). Thus
any hyperpolarizing perturbation of the membrane potential is
opposed by activation of Ih, whereas any depolarizing perturbation is counteracted by IA. This arrangement suggests that these
two resonant conductances act as a functional stabilization unit
that maintains RMP within certain bounded values in TC neurons.
Interestingly, there is experimental and computational evidence of
the concerted expression of Ih and IA in other neurons, indicating
that they indeed balance each other at the molecular level to
control excitability (Burdakov 2005; Hoffman et al. 1997; MacLean et al. 2005; O’Leary et al. 2013).
Resonant Ih
According to the model in Fig. 11, it is expected that increasing
Ih would have a hampering effect on the oscillations, whereas
decreasing Ih would promote oscillations. Indeed, these effects are
reproduced by the TC neuron model under conditions of increased
IT and without injection of constant current. Under these specific
conditions, increasing Ih induces depolarization and further stabilization of the membrane potential, and decreasing Ih induces
hyperpolarization with the consequent deinactivation and regenerative activation of IT leading to spontaneous oscillations (Fig.
10A). However, oscillations can be elicited under conditions of
increased Ih by injection of constant hyperpolarizing current under
conditions of increased IT. This is due to the overlap between the
voltage range of the initial phase of activation of IT and the final
stages of deactivation of Ih (not depicted in Fig. 11). The induced
hyperpolarization activates Ih and deinactivates IT, whose availability becomes transiently increased. Activation of Ih, in turn,
recovers the membrane potential toward RMP, as mentioned
before. Yet, as the membrane depolarizes, and before Ih is completely deactivated, IT starts to activate and eventually becomes
regenerative, initiating the oscillations. Thus, although Ih is a
recovering conductance that tends to stabilize the membrane
potential, it may promote oscillations under conditions of imposed
hyperpolarization, such as those produced by synaptic inhibition.
Repetitive Burst Firing and EEG Rhythms
The occurrence of rhythmic burst firing of TC neurons is
more frequent during the phases of sleep characterized electroencephalographically by slow waves at a frequency of 1– 4
Hz (delta oscillations; see review, McCormick and Bal 1997).
In addition, rhythmic burst firing is also timely correlated with
electroencephalographic spike and wave discharges (2– 4 Hz)
during episodes of absence seizures (Steriade and Contreras
1995). A third type of thalamocortical EEG rhythm associated
with repetitive burst firing is characterized by spindle waves
occurring during the early stages of non-rapid eye movement
sleep. During these transient oscillations (every 1–3 s at 7–14
Hz), TC neurons also discharge repetitive bursts at 2– 4 Hz (see
review, McCormick and Bal 1997). Whether the periodicity of
TC neuron burst firing associated with these EEG rhythms is
intrinsically generated or is dependent on the synaptic connectivity in the thalamo-reticular-cortical network is still an unre-

SUBTHRESHOLD CONDUCTANCES OF THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS

solved matter. Our computational analysis shows that repetitive burst firing of TC cells can be enabled/disabled with small
modifications of the intrinsic subthreshold conductances. This
implies that physiological (or pathological) modulation of ion
channel availability could easily modify the propensity of TC
neurons to fire bursts repetitively. This hypothesis is supported
by studies of KO mice of the ion channel subunits underlying
IT and Ih in TC neurons (Lee et al. 2004; Ludwig et al. 2003)
and the study of animal models of absence epilepsy (see
review, Noebels 2012). It is also known that most of the
subthreshold channels are susceptible to modulation by neurotransmitters and neuropeptides acting via multiple signaling
pathways. Except for INaP, the molecular identity of these
subthreshold ion channels expressed in TC neurons is known
today, including IKir (this study). This paves the way to assess
how the modulation of these channels affects the propensity of
TC neurons to fire repetitively, and what consequences this
might have in the generation of the associated EEG rhythms.
The functional role of slow wave sleep is still conjectural. The
proposed functions include halting the flow of sensory information to the cerebral cortex (McCormick and Feeser 1990) and
some aspects of memory consolidation (Stickgold 2005). The
occurrence of burst firing of TC neurons during wakeful states is
also controversial, albeit it has been proposed that bursting increases feature detectability (see review and discussion,
Llinas and Steriade 2006). In a more general context, an
increasing amount of data now indicates that the thalamus
not only functions as a relay station in the flow of information but that it also plays a central role in modulating and
integrating signals across the brain (Sherman 2007). The qualitative analysis presented in this article shows that the dynamic
interaction among subthreshold conductances determines both the
excitability and the oscillatory properties of TC neurons. It remains to be established how changes in this dynamic interaction
affect the neurocomputational properties of these cells. Studies are
under way in our group, using both theoretical and experimental
approaches, to determine how changes in these conductances
impact the input-output transformation of TC neurons.

SUMMARY

Sleep spindles are major transient oscillations of the
mammalian brain. Spindles are generated in the thalamus; however, what determines their duration is
presently unclear. Here, we measured somatic activity of excitatory thalamocortical (TC) cells together
with axonal activity of reciprocally coupled inhibitory
reticular thalamic cells (nRTs) and quantified cycleby-cycle alterations in their firing in vivo. We found
that spindles with different durations were paralleled
by distinct nRT activity, and nRT firing sharply dropped before the termination of all spindles. Both initial
nRT and TC activity was correlated with spindle
length, but nRT correlation was more robust. Analysis of spindles evoked by optogenetic activation
of nRT showed that spindle probability, but not
spindle length, was determined by the strength of
the light stimulus. Our data indicate that during natural sleep a dynamically fluctuating thalamocortical
network controls the duration of sleep spindles via
the major inhibitory element of the circuits, the nRT.

INTRODUCTION
The large-scale activity of the brain is organized by a great variety of network oscillations, which temporally bind the activity of
distinct cell populations. Although a wealth of data indicates a
role of inhibitory GABAergic cells in pacing the frequency of
oscillations (Buzsa´ki, 2006), the mechanisms controlling the
duration and termination of oscillatory events are still mysterious.
A major brain oscillation with variable length is the sleep spindle.
These 1- to 3-s-long transient events have a frequency of
7–15 Hz and are most prevalent during stage II sleep. Appropriate regulation of spindle density and duration is critical to
proper brain function. Spindle density shows strong correlation
with memory performance (Fogel et al., 2007), problem-solving
ability, and the general intelligence of an individual (Bo´dizs

et al., 2005). Both the incidence and duration of spindles
increase following learning (Morin et al., 2008) and decrease
with age (Nicolas et al., 2001). Aberrant spindle-like activity is
believed to underlie absence epilepsy (Avanzini et al., 2000;
Huguenard and McCormick, 2007; Kostopoulos, 2000; Picard
et al., 2007). Extremely long spindles characterize mental retardation in childhood (Gibbs and Gibbs, 1962; Shibagaki et al.,
1982). Schizophrenia on the other hand is associated with a
marked reduction of spindle length (Ferrarelli et al., 2007).
Previous studies (von Krosigk et al., 1993; Steriade and Deschenes, 1984; Steriade et al., 1985) have suggested that
spindles are generated in the thalamus, through a rhythmic interaction of excitatory thalamocortical (TC) neurons and inhibitory
neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami (nRT), that in turn
entrains cortical activity. In this model, synchronized bursts of
nRT neurons cause prolonged inhibition in TC cells, which deinactivate low-threshold Ca2+ (It) channels and induce TC cells to
fire a rebound burst upon IPSP termination. This drives a new
nRT burst and the next oscillation cycle begins.
Several candidate mechanisms have been proposed to control the termination of sleep spindles. These data indicated a progressive change of the intrinsic properties of either TC (Bal and
McCormick, 1996; Lu¨thi and McCormick, 1998; Lu¨thi et al.,
1998) or nRT cells (Bal et al., 1995a; Kim and McCormick,
1998) during the spindles leading to stop burst generation and
the initiation of a next cycle. According to another proposal, spindles terminate due to disruption of the synchronization of
TC-nRT network activity, caused by an increase of poorly timed
cortical input as the spindle progresses (Bonjean et al., 2011;
Timofeev et al., 2001). These proposals make testable predictions for how TC and nRT cells alter their firing activity during
the progression of a spindle. However, testing these alternative
scenarios experimentally has so far remained elusive, due to
the challenge of simultaneously recording topographically
coupled populations of TC and nRT cells in freely sleeping animals. As a consequence the factors controlling the duration of
spindles in vivo—critically correlated with several neuropsychiatric disorders—remained unclear.
In the present study, we performed simultaneous recording of
topographically coupled TC and nRT cells in freely sleeping rats
and quantified their activity on a cycle-to-cycle basis during

spindles with different duration. We found that the synchrony of
the two cell types remains unaltered during spindles, but
nRT cells displayed robust duration specific activity. Optogenetic activation of spindles demonstrated that their duration is
strongly constrained by the concurrent state of the thalamocortical network.
RESULTS
We performed multichannel silicon-probe recordings from the
ventrobasal complex (VB) of urethane-anesthetized (n = 11)
and naturally sleeping rats (n = 5) using silicon probes with four

shanks, separated by 200 mm (Figure 1). Each shank was equipped with eight recording sites in an octrode configuration. In the
majority of experiments, in addition to multiunit activity, a large
number of single units were isolated by spike sorting (see below).
Sleep spindles were defined using thalamic multiunit recordings as an elevation of rhythmic multiunit firing above the background activity in the spindle frequency range (Figure 1A; see
Experimental Procedures and Figure S1A available online). In
naturally sleeping animals, sleep spindles (n = 3,190) appeared
during slow-wave sleep as described before (Gaillard and Blois,
1981; Loomis et al., 1935; Silverstein and Levy, 1976; Steriade,
1999). Under urethane anesthesia, spindles (n = 2,975) were

thane the majority of spindles remained localized to one or two
electrode shanks (Figure 1B). The mean spindle coherence between two shanks at 400 mm distance was 0.2 ± 0.06 for naturally
sleeping and 0.09 ± 0.07 under urethane.
The mean duration of the spindles in both conditions agreed
with previous reports (Azumi and Shirakawa, 1982; Gaillard
and Blois, 1981; Silverstein and Levy, 1976) (10.7 ± 6.0 cycles/
spindle in natural sleep, 9.5 ± 5.3 cycles/spindle under urethane).
The number of short spindles (five to six cycles) was somewhat
higher in natural sleep than under urethane (Figure 1C). The
mean frequency of spindles was also similar in the two conditions (natural sleep 12.65 ± 1.89 Hz, urethane 12.91 ± 1.63 Hz).
Both in natural sleep and under anesthesia, spindles showed
an initially accelerating pattern, irrespective of their length (Figure 1D), as shown by Gardner et al. (2013). Spindles under natural sleep showed a deceleration toward the end, which was not
present under urethane anesthesia.
Thus, we conclude that under our recording conditions sleep
spindles can be reliable detected in the thalamus with comparable parameters (duration, frequency) to earlier results. The basic
features of spindles under urethane and in freely sleeping
conditions were largely similar, with the most prominent difference being that under anesthesia spindles were more spatially
restricted.

Two Types of Spikes in Ventrobasal Thalamus
After spike sorting (see Experimental Procedures and Figure S1B),
a single octrode yielded on average 12.9 well-separated single
units (554 units all together from all animals). The action potential
widths of single units clustered from VB showed a marked bimodality (Figures 2A and 2B), with the narrow-spike mode centered
at 100 ms and a wide spike mode centered at 275 ms. The values of
narrow spikes were actually briefer than the extracellular waveforms of cortical fast-spiking interneurons (Bartho´ et al., 2004).
Units corresponding to both modes were usually recorded on a
single shank. Wide-spike units (>150 ms) displayed burst firing
typical of TC cells (Domich et al., 1986) (3.19 ± 1.52 spikes/burst,
149.0 ± 177.7 Hz for natural sleep, n = 102 units; 2.82 ± 1.11
spikes/burst, 287.0 ± 196 Hz under urethane, n = 320 units). Narrow-spike units (<150 ms) produced longer and slower bursts
(5.17 ± 2.63 spikes/burst, 48.8 ± 81.5 Hz for natural sleep,
n = 17 units, 3.57 ± 1.81 spikes/burst, 90.8 ± 119 Hz under urethane, n = 115 units) and were usually modulated in the spindle
frequency range (Figure 2C). Cross-correlation analysis revealed
that most narrow spike units fired on average 15–20 ms after
wide spike units (Figure S1B4) both in natural sleep and under
urethane anesthesia. These data suggested that beside TC cells
(wide spikes) our electrodes sampled another neuronal population (narrow spikes). However, the origin of narrow spikes remained unclear because the rodent VB thalamus contains only
one type of neuron, the TC cell (Barbaresi et al., 1986).
Narrow Spikes Belong to nRT Axon Terminals
The narrow spikes picked up by our electrodes in VB resembled
axonal spikes that have been described in several neural systems
(Goldberg and Fee, 2012; Khaliq and Raman, 2005; Meeks et al.,
2005). Based on their waveform, bursting characteristics and
the asymmetry of the cross-correlogramm with wide spikes, we

hypothesized that narrow spikes represent axonal action potentials of nRT neurons. To test this, we first performed juxtacellular
single unit recording and labeling from both the nRT (n = 21) and
the VB (n = 10) under urethane anesthesia and compared the
activity of identified cells with wide and narrow spikes. Under
the same conditions, the activity of identified TC (Figure 2C2)
and nRT (Figure 2C4) cells displayed identical features with
wide (Figure 2C1) and narrow (Figure 2C3) spikes, respectively.
Additionally, nRT neurons—like narrow spike units—showed
pronounced spindle modulation (Figure 2C, insets).
To gain more direct evidence, we performed lesion experiments with the axon-sparing neurotoxin, kainic acid (KA)
(n = 3). First, we selectively lesioned the TC cell bodies by
iontophoresis of KA into VB, leaving the recording electrode in
the same position. Before lesion, both wide and narrow spikes
could be recorded in VB, whereas 4 hr after the lesion only
narrow spikes remained in the same recording site (Figure S2).
Spindle modulation of narrow spikes disappeared after VB

lesion. When KA was injected into nRT, only narrow spikes
were affected in VB.
Finally, in one case we were able to perform simultaneous somatic and axonal recording of the same nRT cell by combining
silicon probe recording in VB with juxtacellular recording and
labeling in nRT using neurobiotin-filled pipettes. The two electrodes were aligned according to the receptive field properties
of the recorded units. Figure 3 shows a juxtacellularly recorded
and labeled nRT neuron (Figure 3A), whose somatic action potentials were time-locked (<0.5 ms delay) to extracellular narrow
spikes recorded in VB (Figures 3B and 3C). The silicon probe that
recorded the narrow spikes was located approximately 1 mm
caudomedially from the juxtacellular pipette. Morphological
reconstruction of the juxtacellularly recorded neuron demonstrated a cell body located in nRT and axonal segments in close
vicinity of the silicon probe (Figures 3A and 3D). Based on this
direct evidence and the data listed above, we concluded that
narrow spikes indeed represent axonal activity of nRT cells.

Figure 4. Local Interactions between TC and nRT Cells during Spindles
(A) A single spindle event displayed as smoothed multiunit activity in VB (red) together with TC cells (black) and nRT terminals (magenta) recorded by the same
electrode shank under urethane anesthesia. The firing of both TC cells (black) and nRT axons (magenta) are locked to the local multiunit spindles. Note different
firing frequency and burst length of the TC and nRT cells.
(B) Polar plots showing the phase vectors of individual TC and nRT cells recorded on the same shank relative to the multiunit spindle collected during several
recordings. Top: natural sleep, bottom: urethane anesthesia. One spindle cycle is 360 . TC cells consistently fire at an earlier phase of the oscillation compared to
nRT cells in both conditions.
(C) Cross correlograms between TC and nRT cells on the same electrode shank and between different shanks (200, 400, 600 mm apart) under urethane anesthesia. Robust correlation is evident only on the same shank (red), but modulation in the neighboring shank (green) also reaches significance. No correlation is
apparent, however, on more distant shanks (blue, magenta).

We next asked whether the narrow spikes reflected nRT axon
terminals, which synaptically interact with local TC cells, or passing axons, which do not. To do this, we took advantage of the
localized nature of spindles under urethane. Connectivity between nRT and TC is strictly topographic and reciprocal, with a
single nRT neuron typically restricting its entire axonal arbor to
the same thalamic compartment it receives its major TC input
from (Desıˆlets-Roy et al., 2002). The spatial scale of the axons
arbor is typically of order 200 mm, similar to the shank separation
distance of our multisite electrodes. Under urethane, the majority
of spindles are restricted to one shank (Figure 1B). We therefore
reasoned that if narrow spikes reflected the activity of nRT terminals, interactions between TC and nRT firing should occur within,
but not between distant shanks during spindles. By contrast, if
narrow spikes reflected passing axons, no significant correlation
is expected because passing nRT axons cannot interact with TC
cells. The data showed that both under urethane anesthesia
and drug-free conditions, the activity of TC cells and nRT axon
was not random. The two cell types fired phase-locked to the
thalamic spindles within a shank at characteristically different
phases (Figures 4A and 4B). When considering local spindles
only (from urethane anesthetized recordings), cross-correlograms revealed strong correlation between TC cells and nRT
axons recorded on the same shank (Figure 4C). This correlation
was weaker at 200 mm and was not present between shanks
400 mm apart (Mann-Whitney test). Because the spatial extent
of TC-nRT correlation was compatible with the size of nRT
axon terminal arbor in VB (Pinault and Descheˆnes, 1998), we
conclude that narrow spikes are generated by the axon terminals, not by passing fibers of nRT cells. The fact that axon
terminals produced signals large enough to detect extracellularly, most probably resulted from the occurrence of strings of
extremely closely spaced nRT boutons (Figure S3).

Constant Timing and Jitter during Spindles
Simultaneous recording of the somata of TC cells and the axon
terminals of reciprocally connected nRT neurons allowed us to
quantitatively investigate the structure of population activity during sleep spindles in a cycle-by-cycle basis in freely sleeping
animals (Figures 5A and S4).
According to one hypothesis (see Introduction), spindles
terminate due to disruption of thalamic synchrony by cortical
input (Bonjean et al., 2011; Timofeev et al., 2001). This model
predicts that the precision of TC-nRT interaction should be
degraded as the spindle progresses. To test this, we computed
cross-correlograms between the two cell populations for short
(six cycles, n = 5,579) and long (14 cycles, n = 3,159) spindles
for each consecutive cycles (Figure 5B). The cross-correlograms
showed no marked difference in timing between spindles of
different lengths and no change from cycle to cycle, indicating
a constant latency of nRT activation by TC cells in every cycle
of the spindles. We next assessed the jitter of TC-nRT synchrony
by computing the SD of spike times relative to spindle peaks for
every cycle in the same data set. This measure also showed no
change with spindle progression (Figure 5C). Repeating the
same two analyses for each cycle of every spindle length, in
both freely sleeping and anesthetized animals, yielded identical
results (Figure S5). None of the groups showed significant slope
(Spearman’s rank correlation p > 0.1). We therefore conclude
that decreased TC-nRT efficacy and increased jitter among
thalamic cells is not a major factor in spindle termination.
Decrease of nRT Activity before the Termination
of Spindles
To study the alteration of TC and nRT activity during a spindle,
we computed the cycle-by-cycle dynamics of excitatory and
inhibitory activity for short (six cycles) and long (14 cycles)

spindles (Figure 5D) in freely sleeping animals. During short
spindles animals, nRT activity was highest in the first cycle
(3.5 spikes/cycle) then decreased monotonically, dropping $50%
by the end of the spindle (1.55 spikes/cycle); by contrast, TC cell
activity was lowest in the first cycle and increased steadily. For
long spindles, nRT activity displayed a different, nonmonotonic
pattern, first increasing from a moderate value (2.1 spikes/cycle)
to reach a peak of 3.15 spikes/cycle by cycle 3 and then decreasing strongly to $30% of the peak value (0.83 spikes/cycle)
by spindle termination. During long spindles, TC activity again displayed a slow recruitment, in most cases with a slight decrease
one to two cycles before the spindle ended.
Examining similar plots for spindles of all lengths (Figure S6A)
indicated that in all cases nRT activity started to decrease
several cycles before spindle termination, but this was not
observed in case of TC cells in either natural sleep or urethane
anesthesia. Based on these data, we conclude that nRT, but
not TC activity starts to decay several cycles before the termination of all spindles.
Distinct nRT Activity Trajectories for Spindles
with Different Length
The analysis above indicated that nRT cells may display spindle
duration specific activity. To demonstrate this, we analyzed
cycle-by-cycle TC and nRT activity for all spindle length. During
spindles thalamic neurons fire exclusively in low-threshold Ca2+
bursts. Each neuron can produce one burst per spindle cycle but
neither nRT nor TC cells fire at every cycle. As a consequence,
changes in the number of spikes during consecutive cycles
(as analyzed above) could reflect either a change in the number
of spikes fired per burst, and/or a change in the probability the
cell will fire a burst in the cycle (participation probability). It
should be noted that participation probability is equivalent to
the percentage of cells participating in a given spindle cycle,
which indicates the level of recruitment within the TC or nRT population. To examine the cycle-by-cycle alterations in these measures, we calculated spike/burst and participation probability

separately for all TC and nRT cells for all
spindle length (five to 14 cycles) during
natural sleep (Figure 6).
For nRT cells, the number of spikes per
burst started at a uniformly high level
(approximately five) for all spindle lengths and showed a monotonic decrease to approximately three to four spikes per burst
by the end of the spindle. TC cells, on the other hand did not
display significant alteration in burst size during the spindles
(Figure 6A). For participation probability, nRT cells displayed pronounced differences between short and long spindles (Figure 6B).
The shortest spindles were characterized by high initial nRT
participation probability (60%), which dropped throughout the
spindle to a moderate level (46%–49%) by termination. Longer
spindles, however, started from a progressively lower probability
levels (<40%) followed by an increase (reaching a plateau similar
to the initial state of short spindles), then a decrease to a low level
again. The endpoint of nRT participation probability was progressively lower with increasing spindle length. In contrast, the participation probability of TC cells displayed continuous increase
during both long and short spindles until one to two cycles before
spindle termination (from 35%–40% to 40%–45%). During natural
sleep and under urethane anesthesia the spike per burst and
probability trajectories were similar (Figure S6) confirming relatively intact spindle genesis under this anesthetic (for statistical
analysis of the trajectories under both conditions see Figure S7).
We conclude that spindles are characterized by a progressive
decrease in the burst size of nRT neurons. TC cells show a
steady increase in participation probability irrespective of spindle length with no change in burst size. In addition nRT but not
TC cells display distinct activity trajectories during short and
long spindles.
Network State Controls Spindle Length
The large difference in duration-specific nRT activity prompted
us to investigate how the measured variables at the first cycle
correlate with the duration of spindles. The probability of nRT
participation in the first cycle was strongly correlated with spindle duration (r = À0.91; p < 0.001; Figure 7A), whereas same
measure of TC cells displayed only weakly significant correlation
(r = 0.63; p = 0.047). In addition the number of spikes per burst in
the first cycle also showed significant correlation with spindle

These data allow two alternative scenarios about the control of correlation though, between the length of adjacent spindles.
We tested the effect of nRT population recruitment by varying
spindle length. First, spindle length might be causally determined
by nRT activity on the first cycle alone. Alternatively, the correla- either stimulus intensity (n = 14) or duration (n = 11) using stimution might occur because first-cycle nRT activity is under the lation parameters from subthreshold to maximal strength. The
probability of evoking spindles increased both with stimulus
control of the ongoing network state.
To explore these possibilities we induced sleep spindles opto- intensity (Figure 8C, top), and duration (Figure 8D, top), ranging
genetically (Halassa et al., 2011) in parvalbumin-channelrhodop- from 0% to 56%. This shows that the magnitude of nRT activation
sin (PV-ChR) (three animals, eight sessions) and vesicular-GABA could be changed profoundly under these experimental conditransporter-channelrhodopsin (vGAT-ChR) mice (nine animals, tions using the stimulus intensity range we applied. Still, in 20
17 sessions). These strains express channelrhodopsin in both out of 24 sessions, there was no correlation between stimulus
somata and axon terminals of nRT cells. Laser stimuli were intensity or duration and spindle length (Figures 8C and 8D,
delivered either to the nRT somata (n = 10), or to nRT axon termi- bottom; p > 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). The remaining four showed
nals in VB (n = 15) with identical results. The experiments were inconsistent and weak correlations in multiple directions. In four
performed under urethane anesthesia to gain large enough animals (six sessions), we kept the stimulus parameters and
sample in a homogeneous state using the same multishank recording locations constant and summed the data across

animals. In this pooled data set also no significant difference
was found between spindle length evoked by the three different
stimulus intensities (0.14 mW, 4.4 mW, 10.5 mW, 1,200 repetitions each; Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.11). These results together
indicate that the magnitude of of nRT cell activation does not
directly correlate with spindle length. Rather, a constantly fluctuating network state controlls spindle duration probably via
determining the size of recruitable nRT population.
Interestingly, the length distribution of spontaneous and
evoked spindles differed significantly in 41.6% (10/24) of the
experiments (Figure 8E; Mann-Whitney test), due to the absence
of both the longest and shortest spindles in the evoked data.
We suggest that these exceptional spindles arise from precisely
calibrated population activity patterns that cannot be mimicked
by laser stimulation.
DISCUSSION
We quantitatively characterized the dynamics of mutually connected excitatory TC and inhibitory nRT populations during
sleep spindles in vivo. We found that nRT activity drops during
the later phases of spindles irrespective of its length. In contrast,
TC activity rose steadily throughout spindle duration. Activity
trajectories in nRT cells, but not TC cells, were different between
long and short spindles and the ongoing network activity strongly
influenced spindle length.
Technical Considerations
The somatic activity of TC cells and the axonal activity of nRT
cells were distinguished by nonoverlapping spike width, different
firing and burst patterns, and different phase preference relative
to the local spindle oscillation (Figures 2, 4, and S1B). Although
extracellular axonal recordings of nRT cells have to our knowledge not been demonstrated before in freely sleeping animals,
extracellular axonal recordings have previously been reported
in other structures, and our spike width data are consistent
with these earlier findings (Goldberg and Fee, 2012; Khaliq and
Raman, 2005; Meeks et al., 2005; Robbins et al., 2013). In the
present case, direct evidence for axonal recording has also
been obtained by simultaneous recording of the soma and
the axon of the same nRT cell (Figure 3). These anatomical and
physiological data unambiguously demonstrate that when we
measure TC somatic and nRT axonal activity via the same
electrode shank we measure reciprocally coupled excitatory
and inhibitory cell populations.
In every spindle cycle, TC cell activity preceded nRT activity by
15–20 ms (Figures 5B, S1B, and S5), followed by a longer delay
(60–90 ms) before the next cycle started with the TC activity
again. This pattern is fully consistent with the ‘‘ping-pong’’ mechanism of spindle genesis whereby TC firing induces an nRT
burst, which in return evokes a prolonged inhibition in TC cells,
enabling TC cells to fire a rebound burst and initiate the next
cycle (von Krosigk et al., 1993).
The overall spindle dynamics were similar between natural sleep
and urethane anesthesia, and the cycle-by-cycle trajectories of
firing parameters in both TC and nRT cells displayed a surprisingly
similar pattern (Figures S4, S5, and S6) despite the fact that urethane has been shown to have a depressing effect on neuronal

excitability (Sceniak and Maciver, 2006). The most striking difference between freely sleeping and anesthetized spindles was in
their spatial distribution: natural sleep was characterized by
large-scale global spindle synchrony, whereas under urethane
most spindles were restricted to a 200–400 mm volume (Figures
1B and 4C). Intriguingly, a similarly localized spindle pattern has
been demonstrated in decorticated animals (Contreras et al.,
1996, 1997). We therefore hypothesize that the localized nature
of spindles under urethane anesthesia may reflect decreased
corticothalamic activity relative to the naturally sleeping state.
Decrease of Inhibition and the Termination of Spindles
Three major theories have been put forward to explain the termination of spindles: that corticothalamic input desynchronizes
the thalamic network during the waning of spindles (Bonjean
et al., 2011); that progressive depolarization of TC cells unables
them to fire rebound bursts toward the end of the spindle
(Bal and McCormick, 1996; Lu¨thi and McCormick, 1998; Lu¨thi
et al., 1998); or that spindles terminate due to progressive
hyperpolarization of nRT cells (Bal et al., 1995b; Kim and McCormick, 1998). However, to date no cycle-by-cycle analysis of
neuronal activity has been performed in freely sleeping animals.
Our data do not directly support the desynchronization hypothesis, because we did not find increased jitter before the termination of the spindles (Figures 5 and S5). Some aspects of our data
are consistent with the TC cell depolarization hypothesis because
the percentage of active TC cells progressively increased during
each spindle. Nevertheless, we found no decrease in the number
of TC spikes/burst toward the end of the spindles (Figures 5D, 6A,
6B, and S6), which would be expected if TC cells had become
depolarized. Although recent data suggest that under the right
conditions TC cells can still fire bursts even when depolarized,
(Dreyfus et al., 2010), the fact that TC cells do not show reduced
bursting at spindle termination argues against an exclusive role of
TC depolarization in ending spindles.
The model of spindle termination most strongly supported by
our data is instead progressive hyperpolarization of nRT cells
(Bal et al., 1995a; Kim and McCormick, 1998). According to
this hypothesis, inhibitory activity gradually decreases during
the spindle, and once inhibitory input has decreased below a
minimal value required for evoking rebound bursts in TC cells
the oscillation will be terminated. Consistent with this possibility,
we found that nRT burst size fell continuously throughout spindles of all durations, whereas the fraction of nRT cells active
initially rose, before falling precipitously three to four cycles
before spindle termination (Figures 5D, 6A, 6B, and S6). The
mechanisms leading to the decreased nRT activity toward the
end of the spindle remain to be established: whereas it may
reflect conductances intrinsic to nRT neurons (Bal and McCormick, 1993; Cueni et al., 2008; Kim and McCormick, 1998), it
could also result from alteration in corticothalamic input as
suggested by Bonjean et al. (2011). Future modeling and experimental studies are thus required to elucidate the exact
intracellular events underlying spindle termination.
Initial Network State and the Duration of Spindles
Two models can be put forward to control the duration of a transient neural oscillation. Length could be predetermined by the

Thalamic Network Activity during Sleep Spindles

network state at the onset of the oscillation; alternatively, the
oscillation could be stopped by a signal (extrinsic or intrinsic to
the network) that emerges at a random time point once the
transient is under way. In the first case, the oscillations are
predicted to follow rigid activity trajectories, correlated with the
initial state. In the latter case, no correlation is expected between
initial state, end state, and duration.
Our data support the first hypothesis in the case of sleep spindles. We found a robust correlation between the participation
probability of nRT cells in the first cycle and the length of the
spindle (Figure 7A). A similar, though weaker relationship existed
between spindle duration and both the participation probability
and spike/burst of TC cells. We also observed a strong correlation between the participation probability of nRT cells in the first
and the last cycles (Figure 7C). These data indicate that the initial
state of the network has strong influence on spindle duration,
and, once a spindle is launched, it does not evolve randomly
but follows a rigid trajectory between fixed start and end points.
The optogenetic experiments, however, indicated that there is
no fixed correlation between the magnitude of nRT activation
and the evoked spindle length. This suggests that spindle
duration is determined by more complex variables, such as the
precise state of neuromodulators and/or degree of cortical drive
present at spindle initiation. Such variables would affect both
the nRT firing pattern seen on the first cycle, and phenomena
controlling spindle duration, such as the speed at which nRT
cells become hyperpolarized as the spindle progresses.
Our data indicate that quantitative cycle-by-cycle analysis of
excitatory and inhibitory activity can be used to test hypotheses
regarding what determines the duration of transient network
events. Because short, transient oscillations with widely different
frequencies are abundant in the brain (e.g., type II theta activity,
alpha waves, transient gamma oscillations, sharp wave ripples,
etc.), similar analyses may help to determine the mechanisms
of these oscillations. The duration of transient oscillatory events
is plastic, changing both under healthy conditions (e.g., following
learning) and also in case of neurological diseases. Thus,
defining the mechanism underlying the duration of these transients can lead to better understanding of the temporal organization of neuronal activity in both healthy and diseased states.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Surgery and Recording
All animal procedures were approved by the Institute of Experimental Medicine Protection of Research Subjects Committee as well as the Food-Safety

and Animal-Health Office of the Pest District Government Bureau, which is
in line with the European Union regulation of animal experimentations. For general surgical procedures, see Bartho´ et al. (2004). Briefly, 41 male Wistar rats
were used in the study. For anesthetized experiments (n = 36), rats were
administered 1.5 g/kg urethane, the skull was opened over somatosensory
cortex and thalamus (À3.0 AP, 2.8 ML from Bregma), dura was removed,
and silicon microelectrodes (Neuronexus Technologies) were lowered into
the brain. The probes used were mostly 32 site, four shank octrodes, in five
thalamic experiments and most of cortical recordings 32 site linear probes.
In anesthetic-free, chronic experiments (n = 5), for the surgery the animals
were anesthetized with a mixture (4 ml/kg) of ketamine (25 mg/ml), xylazine
(1.3 mg/ml). Silicon probes were implanted above the thalamus attached to
a custom-manufactured microdrive. After 1 week of recovery, the probes
were moved gradually, and recordings were made at several depth locations.
Tungsten wires (50 mm) were implanted to both primary somatosensory of
motor cortices, also in hippocampus in three cases. Three of the five chronic
animals yielded narrow spike units of clusterable quality.
For juxtacellular recording and labeling, glass micropipettes (20–70 MU)
filled with 1.5% Neurobiotin (Vector Laboratories) were used. After perfusion,
60-mm-thick coronal brain sections were cut on a Vibratome and incubated
with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories). The labeled cells
were visualized using nickel-intensified diaminobenzidine (DAB) reaction.
Labeled neurons and axonal trees were reconstructed using Camera Lucida.
In case of dual nRT-VB recording experiments first a silicon probe was lowered
into VB, and the receptive field of the multiunit was determined. Next, nRT units
with a matching receptive field were then sought with several penetrations of
a juxtacellular recording pipette.
Lesion experiments were performed by recording a baseline session from
VB, followed by iotophoresis of 1% kainic acid (À2 mA, 7 s on/off cycle) for
20 min without moving the electrodes. Several (3–4) hours later postlesion
session was recorded from the same electrode.
Optogenetics
Parvalbumin-channelrhodopsin and vesicular GABA-transporter-channelrhodopsin mouse strains were generated by crossing PV-cre or vGAT-cre
(The Jackson Laboratory) mice with -129S-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm32(CAG-COP4*
H134R/EYFP-Hze (The Jackson Laboratory) reporter strains. For optical stimulation a 473 nm DPSS laser (LaserGlow) was used via a fiberport (Thorlabs)
and a patch cord (Thorlabs) to the brain-implanted optic fiber. The optic fiber
was either attached to the silicon probe in close proximity (<200 mm) of the
recording site (axonal stimulation), or inserted directly into the nRT (somadendritic stimulation). Light intensity was modulated through the DPSS power
supply, with a MATLAB-controlled DAQ-board (National Instruments). Stimulus strength was adjusted to span a range from near-threshold ($0.1 mW)
to maximal effect ($10 mW).
Data Analysis
Extracellular signals were high-passed filtered (0.3 Hz), amplified (2,000 times)
by a 64-channel amplifier, and digitized at 20 kHz with two National Instruments PCI-6259 cards. After detection, units were grouped by the semiautomatic ‘‘cluster cutting’’ algorithm (‘‘KlustaKwik’’; available at http://github.
com/klusta-team) followed by manual clustering (Csicsvari et al., 2003).

Note the state fluctuations between desynchronized (blue arrows), slow-wave sleep (green arrows), and lightly synchronized (red arrows) states with spontaneous spindles.

Thalamic Network Activity during Sleep Spindles

Auto- and cross-correlograms were inspected to verify the clustering procedure. The quality of spike clusters was estimated with the ‘‘isolation distance’’
measure (Schmitzer-Torbert et al., 2005) (Figure S1). Spike width was
measured as the width of the extracellular spike waveform at half-amplitude
(Bartho´ et al., 2004).
All data analysis was performed in MATLAB (MathWorks). Spindles were detected semiautomatically from the thalamic multiunit activity (MUA) separately
for each shank (for details, see Figure S1). After automatic detection, spindles
were verified visually, and false detections were deleted.
Spindle phases were estimated at the maximal amplitude of Morlet wavelet
transform using scales between 7 and 20 Hz.
Jitter was defined as the SD of spike distances from spindle peak during a
given cycle. For cycle-by-cycle cross-correlograms, only the reference spikes
contained within the given cycle were considered. Number of spikes per burst
in a cycle was estimated as the number of spikes fired, given the cell participated in a given cycle. Spike numbers per cycle, participation probability,
and spikes per burst (Figures 5D, 6, and S6) were calculated for each spindle
length category averaged across all cells in all animals.
Histological Analysis
Following the neurophysiological recordings, animals were transcardially
perfused first with saline, and then with 400–500 ml of fixative containing
4% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Tissue blocks were cut on a Vibratome into 50 mm coronal sections. Electrode
tracks were reconstructed from Nissl-stained slices (chronic experiments) or
fluorescently counterstained for parvalbumin (acute experiments, the silicon
probe was dipped in DII solution beforehand).
After lesion experiments, the fixed brain was cut into 50-mm-thick sections
and or fluorescently counterstained for the neuronal marker NeuN to visualize
the spread of lesion. The immunofluorescence stainings were performed
according to the following protocol. Sections were intensively washed with
PB and then treated with a blocking solution containing 5% normal goat serum
(NGS) and 1% Triton-X for 45 min at room temperature. The primary antibody
against PV (rabbit 1:3,000; Swant) and/or NeuN (mouse 1:300; Millipore) was
diluted in PB containing 0.1% NGS and 0.2% Triton-X. After primary antibody
incubation (overnight at room temperature), sections were treated with the
secondary antibody Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat antimouse immunoglobulin (Ig)G and/or Alexa-594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
or goat anti-mouse IgG for 2 hr at room temperature. After further PB washes,
sections were mounted in vectashield (Vector) and imaged using epifluorescent microscopy (Zeiss).

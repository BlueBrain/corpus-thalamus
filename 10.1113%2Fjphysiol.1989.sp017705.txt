SUMMARY

1. Calcium currents were recorded with whole-cell voltage-clamp procedures in
relay neurones of the rat thalamus which had been acutely isolated by an enzymatic
dissociation procedure.
2. Low-threshold and high-threshold Ca2+ currents were elicited by depolarizing
voltage steps from holding potentials more negative than -60 mV. A transient
current, analogous to the T-current in sensory neurones, was activated at low
threshold near -65 mV and was completely inactivating at command steps up to
-35 mV. Voltage steps to more depolarized levels activated a high-threshold current
that inactivated slowly and incompletely during a 200 ms step depolarization.
3. The high-threshold current contained both non-inactivating and slowly
inactivating components which were insensitive and sensitive to holding potential,
respectively.
4. A 'T-type' current was prominent in relay neurones, in both absolute terms
(350 pA peak current average) and in relation to high-threshold currents. The
average ratio of maximum transient to maximum sustained current was greater
than 2.
5. T-current could be modelled in a manner analogous to that employed for the
fast Na+ current underlying action potential generation, using the m3h format. The
rate of activation of T-current was voltage dependent, with a time constant (T.)
varying between 8 and 2 ms at command potentials of -60 to -10 mV at 23 'C. The
rate of inactivation was also voltage dependent, and the time constant Th varied
between 50 and 20 ms over the same voltage range. With command potentials more
positive than -35 mV, the inactivation of Ca2+ current could no longer be fitted by
a single exponential.
6. Steady-state inactivation of T-current could be well fitted by a Boltzman
equation with slope factor of 6-3 and half-inactivated voltage of - 83-5 mV.
7. Recovery from inactivation of T-current was not exponential. The major
component of recovery (70-80 % of total) was not very voltage sensitive at potentials
more negative than -90 mV, with Tr of 251 ms at -92 mV and 23 'C, compared to

225 ms at -112 mV. A smaller, voltage-sensitive component accounted for the
remainder of recovery.
8. All kinetic properties, including rates of activation, inactivation, and recovery
from inactivation, as well as the amplitude of T-current, were temperature sensitive
with Q10 (temperature coefficient) values of greater than 2-5.
9. These properties of the T-current are such that its activation is necessary and
sufficient to cause the generation of low-threshold calcium spikes in thalamic relay
neurones, although other ionic conductances may modulate such events.
INTRODUCTION

A prominent burst-firing response is one of the characteristic properties of
thalamic relay neurones, as revealed by in vivo intracellular recordings in cat
(Deschenes, Roy & Steriade, 1982; Deschenes, Paradis, Roy & Steriade, 1984) as well
as in vitro studies in thalamic slices of guinea-pig (Jahnsen & Llinas, 1984a, b) and
rat (Crunelli, Kelly, Leresche & Pirchio, 1987). The burst is characterized by a lowthreshold spike (LTS) which can be evoked either by depolarizing current injection
or orthodromic synaptic excitation when the resting membrane potential is more
negative than approximately -60 mV. The LTS is a Ca2"-dependent, slow (2050 ms), 10-30 mV envelope of depolarization that can in turn trigger multiple Na'dependent action potentials.
Although the Ca2"-dependent LTS plays a significant role in determining the spike
firing pattern of neurones in a number of brain areas including thalamus (Jahnsen &
Llinas, 1984b), inferior olive (Llina's & Yarom, 1981), pontine reticular formation
(Greene, Haas & McCarley, 1986), habenula (Wilcox, Gutnick & Christoph, 1988),
and some neocortical areas (Friedman & Gutnick, 1987), the characteristics of the
underlying transient Ca2+ current have not been examined. The LTS burst-firing
mechanism is particularly important in determining the response characteristics of
thalamocortical relay neurones (Deschenes, et al. 1984; Jahnsen & Llina's, 1984a).
Rhythmic burst firing in these cells is correlated with behavioural states such as
slow-wave sleep (reviewed in Steriade & Llinas, 1988) and may be important in
generating pathological thalamocortical rhythms such as spike-wave discharges in
petit mal epilepsy (Coulter, Huguenard & Prince, 1989).
There are a number of ionic conductances present in relay neurones (Jahnsen &
Llinas, 1984b) that may contribute to the generation of the LTS, including (1) a lowthreshold Ca2+ current activated by depolarization from hyperpolarized potentials,
(2) a persistent, tetrodotoxin-sensitive, low-threshold Na+ conductance activated
by depolarization, and (3) an anomalous rectifier current activated by hyperpolarization. However, the Ca2+-dependent component appears to be the major
factor in generating the LTS, since removal of extracellular Ca2+ or the addition of
Ca2+ channel blockers such as Cd2' abolish the LTS, while the latter is unaffected by
tetrodotoxin which blocks Na+ currents (Jahnsen & Llinas, 1984b). Several types of
neuronal Ca2+ currents have been identified in sensory neurones of the rat and chick
dorsal root ganglion (Carbone & Lux, 1984; Nowycky, Fox & Tsien, 1985) and the
activation properties of one of these, the low-threshold or 'T' current, are such that
it may be implicated in the generation of the LTS. We have undertaken a voltage-

clamp study to characterize the Ca2" currents in thalamic relay neurones acutely
isolated from non-embryonic tissue (Kay & Wong, 1986). The somatosensory
ventrobasal complex (VB) of the rat was chosen as the source of thalamic neurones
because in rodents this set of nuclei contains a nearly pure population of relay cells;
there are less than 1 % interneurones (Jones, 1985; Harris & Hendrickson, 1987). The
major focus of this report is on the voltage-dependent properties of the low-threshold
transient (T-type) current in these cells.
METHODS

Preparation and enzymatic isolation procedure
Since interneurones might be selectively spared during the trauma of the dissociation procedure
described below, we initially used an antibody to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), kindly
provided by Dr Donald Schmechel, and standard immunocytochemical techniques to assess the
numbers of GABA(y-aminobutyric acid)ergic neurones in our dissociated neuronal preparation.
Only rare cells obtained from VB in isolation reacted positively for the presence of GAD (not
shown), and these were easily distinguished from the larger relay neurones.
All experiments were carried out using cells isolated from 2- to 25-day-old Wistar rats.
Dissociation methods were modified from those of Kay & Wong (1986). Pregnant rats were
obtained at 18 days gestation from Simonsen Laboratories (Gilroy, CA, USA) and were housed in
our animal facility. Rat pups were anaesthetized with pentobarbitone, decapitated, and the brains
removed and placed in cold saline (4 TC) for 1-2 min. The brain was then blocked and sectioned in
the coronal plane using a Lancer vibratome (St Louis, MO, USA). Slices (500 ,tm) that contained
the ventrobasal (VB) complex were dissected by scalpel cuts to isolate the thalamus. VB was
identified as a crescent-shaped area, demarcated on its lateral and ventral borders by the external
medullary lamina, medial lemniscus and reticular nucleus. In the youngest animals, where
myelination was less complete, VB was identified by comparing living slices with an atlas made
from Nissl stains of comparably aged animals. Thalamic slices were then incubated for 45-90 min
in an oxygenated PIPES-buffered saline (see Solutions) containing trypsin (Type XI, 8 mg/10 ml).
After enzymatic treatment, the slices were washed in trypsin-free PIPES saline, and VB was
isolated with scalpel cuts. Once isolated, each VB section was divided in half, triturated with firepolished Pasteur pipettes, and plated onto 35 mm plastic Petri dishes (Lux tissue culture dishes,
Miles Scientific, Naperville, IL, USA). Isolated relay neurones were somewhat variable in
appearance but a majority had relatively large somata (15-25 Itm), and several thick (2-3 Itm)
dendrites extending for up to 80 ,tm from the soma. These neurones survived for up to 12 h
following isolation.
Solutions
A PIPES-buffered saline was used in all steps prior to recording currents. It consisted of (in mM):
NaCl, 120; KCl, 5; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1; glucose, 25; piperazine-NN'-bis(2-ethanesulphonic acid)
(PIPES), 20; and the pH was adjusted to 7-0 with NaOH (Kay & Wong, 1986). For whole-cell
recording of Ca21 currents the following solutions were used. Intracellular solution (mM): Tris-PO4
(dibasic), 110; Tris base, 28; EGTA, 11; MgC12, 2; CaCl2, 0 5; Na2 ATP, 4; pH 7-3. Extracellular
solution (mM): NaCl, 155; KCl, 3; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 3; tetrodotoxin, 0-0005; HEPES, 10; and pH
adjusted to 7-4 with NaOH. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA).

Electrophysiological recordings
Isolated relay neurones were voltage clamped using the whole-cell configuration of the patch
clamp (Hamill, Marty, Neher, Sakmann & Sigworth, 1981). Electrodes were pulled from thickwalled borosilicate glass (H15/10/181, Jencons Ltd, Leighton Buzzard) on a List L/M-3P-A
(Medical Systems, Great Neck, NY, USA) puller using a two-step procedure. When filled with
intracellular Tris-PO4 solution, electrode resistances were 5-8 MQ. An 8 mV liquid junction
potential was measured between the intracellular and extracellular solutions (see Hagiwara &
Ohmori, 1982), and this correction was applied post facto to all command potentials. Current
recordings were obtained with either the List EPC-7 (Medical Systems) or the Axopatch 1A

amplifier (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA, USA). In either case, series resistance compensation
was used to eliminate 90 % of the voltage error due to the passage of current through the patch
pipette. Access resistance was normally in the range of 6-10 MQ. Inward Ca2+ currents were always
less than 1 nA with a resulting maximum series resistance error smaller than 1 mV, when
compensated by 90 %.
A modified subtraction technique (based on Bezanilla & Armstrong, 1977) was used to remove
interference from linear leak and capacitative currents. Several scaled hyperpolarizing leak pulses
were applied from a reduced holding potential (-50 mV) before the holding potential was
increased to conditioning potential (normally -100 mV) for 1 s preceding the command step.
Stimuli were normally applied at < 0-1 Hz. These protocols allowed Ca2+ currents to be recorded
in relay neurones for up to 75 min. Ca2+ current records obtained by linear leak subtraction were
indistinguishable from those in experiments where the leak and capacitative currents were
obtained by applying the normal stimulation protocol to a neurone bathed in normal extracellular
saline with 0-5 mM-CdCl2 added to block Ca2+ currents.
Voltage-clamp control was judged by several criteria, including (1) smooth voltage-dependent
current activation, (2) lack of excessive delay in onset of current, and (3) onset and offset kinetics
that were dependent on voltage but not on the amplitude of current (see Results). Only cells in
which adequate clamp conditions were obtained using these criteria were included in this kinetic
study. Isopotentiality of neuronal membrane was assured by testing the exponentiality of the
capacitative transient (Kay & Wong, 1987).
Most experiments were performed at room temperature (22-24 'C) since survival of isolated cells
was prolonged under these conditions. For experiments where temperature dependence was
determined, the chamber which encased the Petri dishes was warmed by a feedback-controlled
resistive heater. Bath temperature was monitored with a small thermocouple placed in the
chamber within 100 1um of the neurone under study.
Data storage and analysis
Data were sampled on line in either unsubtracted or leak-subtracted form using a DEC 11-73
based computer equipped with the Cheshire interface (Indec Systems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
running under BASIC-23. Currents and command voltages were also recorded in pulse code
modulated form (Neurocorder, Neurodata, NY, USA) and stored on videotape for back-up
purposes. For kinetic fits to current records, an iterative approach was used in which the
parameters were adjusted by means of the analog inputs on the Cheshire interface. This method
was found to provide a rapid means of fitting onsets and exponential decays with up to two
components. A non-linear least-squares fitting routine (Schreiner, Kramer, Krischer & Langsam,
1985) was used to verify these results in representative traces; the fits obtained by these two
methods were not significantly different (see Results) in the rate constants or amplitudes of the
various components.
RESULTS

Ca2+ currents in relay neuroses
Dissociated relay neurones were similar to several other types of isolated central
neurones in that they were normally truncated at the level of the primary or
secondary dendrites, and had very low input conductance when measured in the
whole-cell clamp mode (Numann & Wong, 1984; Huguenard & Alger, 1986; Kay &
Wong, 1987), normally less than 1 nS. Inward currents could often be recorded, even
in unsubtracted traces. With the use of the appropriate solutions, Ca2+ currents were
readily obtained. When depolarizing step commands were applied from a holding
potential of -100 mV, Ca2+ current components with different onset and decay
kinetics were seen at various command potentials (Fig. 1). Small depolarizations to
between -60 and -40 mV resulted in a rapidly activating inward current that
completely inactivated within a 200 ms depolarization. The rate of current decay
became more rapid with increasing depolarizations within this voltage range. With

stronger depolarizations (more positive than -40 mV) the current was incompletely
inactivating during the depolarization, and the rate of current decay became slower
(e.g. compare currents at -20 through to 0 mV command steps in Fig. 1). These
transient and sustained currents and the I-V relationships for the different
components shown in Fig. 2 are similar to those seen in sensory neurones (Fox,

Fig. 1. Thalamic calcium currents. Leak-subtracted traces are shown for step
depolarizations to the indicated command potentials (mV) from a holding potential of
-100 mV. The maximum isolated transient current is obtained at -40 mV (*); with
more depolarized commands a persistent component is seen, which becomes maximal near
0 mV (**). When the holding potential was reduced to -30 mV, the transient components
of the current disappeared, but the persistent component remained at almost the same
level. For example, the current obtained with depolarization to + 10 mV from reduced
holding potential, Vd, is shown at the arrowhead (middle column). The voltage protocol
(V) is indicated above the first column and the current traces (I) below.

Nowycky & Tsien, 1987; Carbone & Lux, 1987). The transient component was
prominent in the low-threshold range, with an activation threshold near -60 mV
and a peak near -25 mV (Fig. 2). There was also a smaller high-threshold transient
component activated at commands more positive than -10 mV, which was usually
less than 25 % of the amplitude of the low-threshold transient component. The lowthreshold transient component appears analogous to the type I current characterized
in neuroblastoma (Narahashi, Tsunoo & Yoshii, 1987) or low-voltage-activated
current in sensory neurones (Carbone & Lux, 1984), which has also been termed the
T-current (Nowycky et al. 1985; Fox et al. 1987). The higher threshold component of

the transient current has properties similar to the N-current of Fox et al. (1987), in
that the rate of inactivation is relatively voltage independent, with a time constant
of 90-100 ms in the voltage range of -30 to + 30 mV. The 'N' type of inactivating
current of thalamic cells was different from that in sensory neurones since it made a
relatively small contribution to the total high-threshold current. The final Ca2+592

dependent component is the sustained, high-voltage-activated, or L-current, which
was activated at a threshold near -40 mV and peaked at command potentials near
0 mV (Fig. 2, A). As in sensory neurones (Carbone & Lux, 1984; Nowycky et al. 1985)
and neuroblastoma (Narahashi et at. 1987), the L-current was relatively insensitive
to steady-state inactivation; steady-state currents of similar amplitudes were
obtained from holding potentials of -30 and -100 mV (Fig. 2, *).
All components of inward current were clearly Ca2+ dependent. The maximum
peak, steady-state, and transient currents were increased by 36±3, 28+5 and
45+15% (mean+s.E.M., n = 3), respectively, when [Ca2+]0 was raised from 3 to
11 mm. Under these conditions, the command potentials at which maximum currents
were reached were shifted in the positive direction by 7-10 mV, as expected from the
increase in divalent screening charge (Frankenhaeuser & Hodgkin, 1957; Hille,
1968). Substitution of equimolar Ba2+ for Ca2+ resulted in comparable 'T' currents,
while high-threshold currents were increased in amplitude and exhibited slower
inactivation kinetics. In the presence of 0 5 mM-Cd2+ or 0 1 mM-La3+, both transient

and persistent current components were blocked or reduced to 1-10 % of control
levels, while 20 ,uM-Cd2+ selectively blocked high-threshold currents and 100 ,tM-Ni2+
selectively reduced 'T' current (not shown), as in sensory neurones (Fox et al. 1987).
Inward current traces were not contaminated by concomitant activation of K+
conductances since replacement of extracellular Na+ and K+ with tetraethylammonium chloride did not alter the currents (not shown).
With command steps positive to -35 mV, a slow time course (Tinactivation ; 50 ms, see Fig. 1) tail
current was activated which was not Ca2+ dependent. In cells with large depolarization-activated
Ca2+ currents which were blocked by 0 5 mM-Cd2 , the tail current was either not affected or only
slightly reduced. This tail current bears some resemblance to I. seen in hippocampal neurones (Kay
& Wong, 1987). Since all depolarization-activated currents were blocked by Cd2+ we presume that
activation of the conductance underlying I. does not interfere with the isolation of 'Ca at
depolarized potentials.

A characteristic feature of Ca2+ currents recorded in relay neurones was a large
low-threshold transient or 'T-type' current component, both in absolute terms and
relative to the size of other components. Based on the similarities in voltage
dependence, Ba2+ permeation and sensitivity to Ni2+ and Cd2+, we have adopted the
nomenclature of Fox et al. (1987) and will refer to the low-threshold transient current
as T-current. The cell in Fig. 2 had over 300 pA of T-current and a ratio near 1:1 for
maximum inactivating to maximum sustained current (I S); in many cells this ratio
was much greater than unity. After allowing 4-5 min for the intracellular perfusate
to reach equilibrium, both transient and sustained components of Ca2+ current were
relatively stable during the remaining period of recording (typically 15-30 min in
this series of experiments). Therefore, the high ratio of I: S was not due to differential
run-down of the L-current, which was effectively maintained at a stable amplitude
by the inclusion of ATP in the pipette solution. It has been suggested that highthreshold Ca2+ channels are localized in the dendrites (Jahnsen & Llinas, 1984b), and
since the dendrites are significantly truncated by the dissociation, it could be argued
that isolated cells would have a less prominent high-threshold component. However,
we found no apparent correlation between the remaining dendritic area and the
amplitude of the L-current in a given dissociated neurone. For example, some cells
with multiple primary and some secondary dendrites had small L-currents, while
others which were truncated at the level of primary dendrites had large L-currents.
In a group of forty-nine cells, the maximum inactivating current (always recorded
near -20 mV) was 350 + 27 pA, the maximum sustained current was 284 + 25 pA,
with a overall average ratio (I:S) of 1-23:1 (Fig. 3A). The average ratio within
individual relay neurones was 2-62 + 067 (Fig. 3B). The discrepancy between these
two ratios may be due to different subpopulations of relay neurones that possess
varying relative sizes of inactivating (mainly T with a small contribution from N) vs.
sustained (L) currents. Anatomical subclasses of relay neurones in VB are known (see
Jones, 1985) which could, in theory, have different physiological properties, as is true
in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (Crunelli, Leresche & Parnavelas, 1987).
Although relay neurones possess both low- and high-threshold Ca2+ conductances,
it is the prominent low-threshold current that underlies some of their unique
physiological behaviour (Steriade & Llina's, 1988). We therefore examined the
voltage-dependent kinetic properties of the T-current in some detail.

Kinetics of activation and inactivation of T-current in relay neurones
Since the T-current displays a number of properties similar to those of the fast Na+
current underlying the action potential (Hodgkin & Huxley, 1952), we applied a
similar model to the analysis of its voltage-dependent kinetics. The time course of the
onset of T-current was sigmoidal in that there was a clear delay or 'foot' on the rising
phase of the current. We applied different models to describe the time course of
current onset, according to the following general equation:

ICa = [I -exp (-t/Tm)]N exp (-t/lr)Ih),

((1)

where Tm is the time constant of activation, N is a whole number between 1 and 4,
Th is the time constant of inactivation, and loo is the current level that would be
reached in the absence of inactivation (Hodgkin & Huxley, 1952). The best fit was
obtained with an N = 3 (mi3); m or M2 produced too little delay and M4 resulted in
excessive delay (Fig. 4). With command potentials more negative than -35 mV, the

Fig. 4. Activation kinetics of T-current in relay neurone. The current trace used for the
fits was obtained from the average of twenty depolarizations to -42 mV from a holding
potential of - 102 mV, using a P/16 subtraction procedure. A sigmoidal onset phase of
the T-current is clearly apparent. Curve fits were obtained by eye for various models
including m'h, m2h, m3h and m4h. The residual (Res.) difference between the data and the
fitted curve is shown for each model. The m3h model obtains the best fit for the onset rate
of the T-current. The parameters were as follows: A (extrapolated initial current
amplitude) = -340 pA and TA = 26-0 ms for all models; Tm was 3-8, 2-4, 2-1 and 1-9 ms
for m'h-m4h, respectively. Non-linear least-squares parameters for the m3h fit were:
A = -337 pA, Th = -25-6 ms and Tm = -2-08 ms.

inactivation phase was well described by a single-exponential decay process. With
more positive commands, however, the time course of decay became more
complicated, with best fit assuming two or more components. The confidence in the
fit of such complicated waveforms is necessarily lower than for simple fits, so the
most reliable information on voltage-dependent kinetics is obtained in the lowthreshold range where T-current is activated in isolation, i.e. more negative than
-35 mV.
Both activation and inactivation of T-current were voltage dependent, becoming
faster with depolarization, such that the duration and latency to peak become
shorter with increasing depolarizations (Fig. 5A and B). The activation (m) phase was
smoothly voltage dependent, with values for Tm gradually varying from 8 to 2 ms in
the voltage range -60 to -10 mV at 23 °C (Fig. 5C). The decay (h) phase was also
voltage dependent, with values for Th varying between 50 and 20 ms, in the same
voltage range (Fig. 5D). At potentials more positive than -40 mV, the voltage
dependence appeared to decrease, although the above-mentioned inability to obtain
reliable curve fits at these potentials made it difficult to quantify this effect reliably.

The activation process was smoothly voltage dependent (Fig. 6C) and could be
described by a Boltzman equation of the following form:

where Pca is the maximum permeability, VI is the potential at which the permeability
is half-maximal, V is the command potential, k is the slope factor, and N is a power

zero-time current (from the m3h fits) by the constant-field equation (Goldman, 1943;
Hodgkin & Katz, 1949; see Kay & Wong, 1987). Threshold for activation was near
-65 mV, and the current was half-maximally activated at -52 mV.

Steady-state inactivation of T-current in relay neuroses
As current-clamp recordings have revealed (Jahnsen & Llinas, 1984a; Deschenes
et al. 1984), the conductance underlying the low-threshold spike in relay neurones is
inactivated at resting membrane potentials near -60 mV. To examine the

membrane potentials between -112 and -62 mV. B, currents obtained with holding

continuous smooth curve is the best-fit Boltzman function for steady-state inactivation
with 14 = - 83-5 mV and k = 6-3. For activation the best fit (m , dotted line) was obtained
with Ii = -63 mV and k = 7-8. Also shown is the mo, curve (dashed line). Initial current
amplitudes were determined from mah fits and converted to activation by dividing by the
constant-field equation. Error bars represent 1 S.E.M.

total T-current is available for activation, and hyperpolarizations beyond -100 mV
are required to completely remove inactivation. The existence of multiple
components which might contribute to the low-threshold Ca2+ current would be
indicated by changes in the time course of activation or inactivation with different
conditioning potentials, assuming these separate components had different kinetic
properties and different steady-state inactivation. Responses obtained at a command
potential of -42 mV from various holding potentials are shown in Fig. 6A. The
equivalent onset and offset kinetics of the superimposed currents (Fig. 6B) provides
evidence for a single current component underlying the low-threshold burst response.
In isolated relay neurones, T-current kinetics at a given command potential were
consistently independent of current amplitude, indicating adequate voltage-clamp
control in these experiments. When the activation curve (ml ) is superimposed on the
steady-state inactivation curve (Fig. 6 C), there is a small amount of overlap

indicating existence of a tonically activated or 'window' current in the range of -55
to -70 mV. Since activation is modeled by M3, voltage dependence of m is obtained
as the cube root of the current activation curve, and this is also shown in Fig. 6C as
the m., curve.

Recovery from inactivation of T-current in relay neuroses
The frequency at which low-threshold spikes can be elicited is dependent on the
process of recovery from inactivation or deinactivation (Jahnsen & Llinas, 1984a)
which determines the relative refractory period. The recovery process proceeds
relatively slowly at -92 mV and 23 TC, with a time constant near 230 ms (Fig. 7).
Recovery after 50 ms can be fitted by a single exponential (Fig. 7B and C) that is
relatively insensitive to voltage. The time constant of recovery (Tr) was 251 + 10-8 ms
(N= 21) at -92 mV compared to 225+20-5 ms (N= 11) at -112mV (P > 005,
two-tailed t test). However, there was an early phase of more rapid recovery which
accounted for approximately 20 % of the total recovery process at -92 mV. While

TRANSIENT ICa IN THALAMIC RELA Y NEURONES

slow recovery (latencies greater than 50 ms) can be well fitted by an exponential
process, a non-zero intercept is evident when the best-fit curves are extrapolated
back to zero recovery time (Fig. 7). Although Tr was not significantly different at
potentials of -92 and -112 mV, the extrapolated zero-time fractional recoveries
were (P < 0 05), with values of 0-19 +0-025 (N = 21) and 0-33 +0-058 (N = 12) for
recovery at -92 and -112 mV, respectively. Hence recovery at early ( < 50 ms)
latencies was much more sensitive to recovery potential than at later times.

Fig. 8. Temperature dependence of activation and inactivation. A, T-currents obtained
with command potential of -42 mV from a Vhol1 of -102 mV at two temperatures. Each
current trace is the average of five individual traces. The smooth curves represent the best
fit to m3h kinetics. At 23-5 0C the current is smaller and slower compared to the current
obtained at 28 'C. Fit parameters were Tm = 2-5 and 1-5 Ms, Th = 33-1 and 18-7 ms, and
amplitude = 540 and 760 pA at 23-5 'C and 28 'C, respectively. B, in a different neurone,
repeated pulses to -42 mV were applied every 30 s while the temperature was gradually
increased over a period of 9 min. Curve fits were obtained for each trace, and the different
fit parameters are shown in a semilogarithmic plot vs. bath temperature. Least-squares
slopes yielded Q10 values of 3-1, 3-1 and 5-0 for amplitude (extrapolated zero-time
amplitude), kh (I/TA) and km (1/Tm) respectively.

Temperature dependence of kinetic properties of T-current in relay neurones
In myocytes (Cavalie, McDonald, Pelzer & Trautwein, 1985), neuroblastoma
(Narahashi et al. 1987) and invertebrate neurones (Kostyuk, Krishtal & Pidoplichko,
1981; Lux & Brown, 1984; Byerly, Chase & Stimers, 1984), Ca2+ currents are known
to be highly temperature sensitive. In order to extrapolate the results of the present
study (performed at room temperature) to the properties of T-current at body
temperature, we have characterized the temperature dependence of the various
kinetic parameters of the current.

In some experiments we were able to change bath temperature while maintaining
stable whole-cell clamp. Under these conditions the Q10 for the various parameters of
the Hodgkin-Huxley type model could be accurately determined within single
neurones. Both activation (Tm) and inactivation (rh) time constants, as well as the
amplitude of the T-current were highly temperature dependent. The time course of
the T-current at increasing temperatures could be well fitted with the m3h model by
changing only the time constants and amplitudes (Fig. 8A). Within the range of
24-34 TC, the temperature dependence is monophasic (Fig. 8B) and Q10 values were
determined for each rate constant and amplitude from the slope of the semilogarithmic function vs. temperature. This experiment was repeated in four cells
with the following values obtained for Q10 km = 3-55 + 0-65, kh = 2-80 + 0-27, and
amplitude = 3-30 + 0-82. The rate of deinactivation was also highly temperature
dependent; rr was near 140 ms at -92 mV and 30 C (not shown), yielding an
estimated Q10 of 2-5 for the recovery process. The survival of isolated neurones was
markedly reduced under conditions of elevated temperature and we were not able to
extend the experimental conditions to include body temperatures, but the voltagedependent parameters describing the T-current at 37 TC may be obtained by
extrapolation (see below).
DISCUSSION

In this report we have examined the properties of the low-threshold, transient Ca2+
current in acutely dissociated mammalian central neurones. We find that several
properties of this current are analogous to those of the T- or low-voltage-activated
current observed in sensory neurones. Similarities include voltage dependence of
activation and inactivation, permeation of Ba2+ comparable to Ca2 , sensitivity to
blockade by Ni2' and relative lack of sensitivity to blockade by Cd21.
These results are in reasonable agreement with those recently obtained with
switched-clamp techniques in rat and cat thalamic slices (Crunelli, Lightowler &
Pollard, 1989). The only major differences are a somewhat slower inactivation rate
and steeper voltage-dependent activation in slice neurones, which may be related to
differences in voltage control in the more intact, less electrotonically compact cells
in the slice, or pecularities of enzyme -treated acutely-isolated thalamic cells. Also,
part of the discrepancy may be due to concentration of Ca2+ used in our experiments
(3 mM), which is higher than that in the above slice study (1 mM) or in cerebrospinal
fluid and the extracellular space of the brain (- 2 mm). The increased concentration
of divalent cations would increase the screening charge (Frankenhaeuser & Hodgkin,
1957; Hille, 1968), and therefore shift the voltage dependence of the gating
parameters for Ca2+ currents. Because the [Ca2+]. used in our experiments is
approximately 1-5 times normal, the voltage-dependent of all kinetic properties
under physiological conditions (2 mM-Ca2+) would be approximately 3-4 mV less
negative than reported here.
From our analysis of the kinetic parameters of the 'T-type' current, we conclude
that this current underlies the low-threshold Ca2+ spike in thalamic relay neurones.
The voltage activation range begins around -65 mV and is half-activated near
-50 mV. This steep voltage dependence, along with the voltage-dependent nature
of the rate of activation, combine to ensure the genesis of the regenerative low-

TRANSIENT ICa IN THALAMIC RELA Y NEURONES

threshold spike. Small depolarizations into the threshold range of the T-current
activate, with relatively slow time course, a small percentage of the total available
channels. This leads to further depolarization, which activates more channels at a
faster rate, and this process then continues to produce the LTS, by analogy with
generation of Na+-dependent high-threshold spikes.
Of course, other ionic conductances are activated in the same voltage range, and
may reduce or enhance the LTS through hyperpolarizing or depolarizing influences.
For example, a persistent Na+ current is present in relay neurones (Jahnsen & Llinas,
1984b), which enhances the LTS by exerting a depolarizing influence. On the other
hand, the Ca2+ that enters during the LTS will activate Ca2+-dependent K+
conductances (Deschenes et al. 1984; Jahnsen & Llinas, 1984b) which would tend to
inhibit the LTS and/or contribute to its termination. A separate repolarizing
mechanism for the LTS is probably not necessary, however, because the rate of
inactivation of the T-current would be sufficiently rapid to cause termination of the
LTS; since Q10 is greater than 2-5, rh would be in the range of 6-15 ms at 37 'C. This
differs from the Na'-dependent action potential in squid axon where the delayed
rectifier current is required to terminate the spike (Hodgkin & Huxley, 1952), but
compares with fast spike generation in myelinated axons which are lacking K+
channels and repolarize through inactivation of Na' channels (Chiu, Ritchie, Rogart
& Stagg, 1979).
The contribution of other types of Ca2+ channels to LTS generation must be minor.
The maximum depolarization in the envelope of the LTS is near -35 mV (Deschenes
et al. 1982; Jahnsen & Llinas, 1984 a), and this is in the voltage range where only the
low-threshold or T-current is activated. Current waveforms in this range can be well
fitted with a single decay process providing evidence for a single component of
current. Further support for this conclusion is obtained from the steady-state
activation protocols in which the waveform does not change with holding potential.
Therefore, T-current is sufficient for the activation of the LTS. The fact that it is
necessary is deduced from the steady-state inactivation data. Any contribution of
the high-threshold current inactivating current (N-current, Fox et al. 1987) would
not require as much hyperpolarization to remove inactivation, since this current is
half-inactivated at -70 mV. The fact that there is little or no activation of LTS at
membrane potentials more positive than -65 mV argues against contributions from
an N-type component. Also, the N-component does not activate until potentials are
above -30 mV (Fox et al. 1987), outside the range for LTS activation. However,
when the LTS reaches threshold for activation of Na+-dependent action potentials,
the other components of Ca2+ current will be activated to 'inject' additional Ca2+
into the cell where it can induce secondary effects such as activation of Ca21dependent after-potentials (Deschenes et al. 1984; Jahnsen & Llinas, 1984 b). This
might be especially important for dendritic function in relay cells since the highthreshold Ca2+ conductance is thought to be localized there (Jahnsen & Llinas,
1984b).
The steady-state inactivation data (Fig. 6) are in general agreement with the
findings of Jahnsen & Llinas (1984 a). Our results would be consistent with inability
to obtain an LTS at holding potentials less negative than -60 mV. However, from
data such as those of Fig. 6, we assume that T-channels should become increasingly

D. A. COULTER, J. R. HUGUENARD AND D. A. PRINCE
available at potentials up to -100 mV. The fact that current-clamp experiments fail
to show increasing LTS amplitude or rate of rise with hyperpolarizations beyond
-75 mV might be due to the concomitant activation of anomalous rectifier current
by stronger hyperpolarizations. This current would tend to shunt the T-current and
reduce that amplitude of the LTS. Additionally, deinactivation of transient
potassium current (A-current, Thompson, 1977; Jahnsen & Llinas, 1984b) would be
enhanced by the hyperpolarization and this may also retard the development of the
LTS.
Recovery from inactivation of T-current in thalamic relay neurones is not a
monophasic process. While a large component of the recovery process proceeds with
a Tr of 250 ms at -92 mV, there is also an initial rapid recovery which accounts for
less than half of the total. With a Q10 of 2-5, Tr would be expected to be around 80 ms
at 37 TC, and this is consistent with the deinactivation time course of LTS in vitro
which is complete within 300 ms (Jahnsen & Llinars, 1984a). This is in contrast to
chick sensory neurones where Tr is approximately threefold slower (Carbone & Lux,
1987), and rat sensory neurones where recovery is biphasic with a fast component of
hundreds of milliseconds and a slower component with Tr greater than 1 s (Bossu &
Feltz, 1986).
As recently emphasized by Steriade & Llinas (1988), three factors contribute to
thalamocortical synchronization during quiet sleep: (1) the intrinsic properties of
thalamic neurones, (2) a synaptic network that includes nucleus reticularis, and (3)
the influence of brain stem reticular formation areas which project to the thalamus.
The Ca2+-dependent low-threshold spike is one of the intrinsic properties that is
characteristic of thalamic neurones. Because T-current activation is necessary and
sufficient for the generation of the LTS, modulation of this specific conductance
would be expected to produce significant behavioural effects on sleep and arousal. A
preliminary report suggests that endogenous neurotransmitters or neuromodulators
can affect thalamic T-current, independent of their effects on membrane potential
(Geijo-Barrientos & Llinas, 1988). Selective effects on T-current may also be
produced by exogenous agents (Tang, Presser & Morad, 1988), including drugs used
in the treatment of petit mal epilepsy (Coulter et al. 1989). These findings raise
interesting questions about the potential role of thalamic neuronal T-current in
pathophysiological processes and the effects of modulation of this important
conductance by endogenous or exogenous substances.

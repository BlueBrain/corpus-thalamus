Abstract
The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) occupies a highly strategic position to modulate sensory processing in the thalamocortical
loop circuitries. It has been shown that TRN visual cells projecting to first- and higher-order thalamic nuclei have distinct levels of
burst spiking, suggesting the possibility that the TRN exerts differential influences on information processing in first- and higherorder thalamic nuclei that compose the lemniscal and non-lemniscal sensory systems, respectively. To determine whether this
possibility could extend across sensory modalities, the present study examined activities of TRN auditory cells projecting to the
ventral and dorsal divisions (first- and higher-order auditory thalamic nuclei) of the medial geniculate nucleus (TRN-MGV and
TRN-MGD cells) in anesthetized rats, using juxta-cellular recording and labeling techniques. Burst spiking of TRN-MGV cells consisted of larger numbers of spikes with shorter inter-spike intervals as compared with that of TRN-MGD cells in auditory response
evoked by noise burst stimuli. Similar distinctions, although not statistically significant, were observed in spontaneous activity. Furthermore, the features of burst spiking varied in association with the topographies of cell body and terminal field locations. These
features of burst spiking are similar to those observed in the two types of TRN visual cells. First- and higher-order thalamic nuclei
are known to have distinct levels of burst spiking across sensory modalities. Taken together, it is suggested that the distinctions
in burst spiking in the TRN, in conjunction with those in thalamic nuclei, could constitute distinct circuitries for lemniscal and nonlemniscal sensory processing in the thalamocortical loop.

Introduction
Burst spiking has a large impact on post-synaptic cell activity
(Swadlow & Gusev, 2001). Therefore, neural circuitries with distinct
levels of burst spiking could operate in different manners for distinct
functions. There are distinctions in the level of burst spiking
between ﬁrst- and higher-order thalamic nuclei that compose the
lemniscal and non-lemniscal sensory systems, respectively. Thalamic
cells in higher-order nuclei have higher propensities to discharge in
burst as compared with those in ﬁrst-order nuclei (He & Hu, 2002;
Ramcharan et al., 2005; Wei et al., 2011). This difference could be
related to the following distinct functions of thalamic nuclei: ﬁrstorder nuclei, being connected with the primary sensory areas in the
cortex, are primarily dedicated to uni-modal sensory processing and
relay peripheral sensory inputs to the cortex, while higher-order
nuclei, receiving highly processed cortical and subcortical inputs
rather than peripheral uni-modal sensory inputs, serve multi-modal
sensory processing (Komura et al., 2001; Cappe et al., 2009) and
compose cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways as well (Sherman, 2012).

Cell activities in these thalamic nuclei are under a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of GABAergic input from the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN)
(Kim et al., 1997; Yu et al., 2009; Halassa et al., 2011) that comprises the two types of cells projecting to ﬁrst- and higher-order thalamic nuclei (Pinault, 2004). It has been shown that TRN visual
cells projecting to the dorsal lateral geniculate (DLG) and lateral
posterior (LP) nuclei (ﬁrst- and higher-order nuclei) have high and
low levels of burst spiking, respectively (Kimura et al., 2012b). This
contrasts with low and high levels of burst spiking in ﬁrst- and
higher-order thalamic nuclei. The TRN, receiving inputs from thalamic nuclei and cortical areas, plays a crucial role in gain and/or
gate control of information processing in the thalamocortical loop
circuitries. Therefore, the synergy between TRN and thalamic cell
activities with their contrasting features of burst spiking may compose distinct information processing and attentional gating functions
in the lemniscal and non-lemniscal sensory systems.
Distinctions in burst spiking between ﬁrst- and higher-order thalamic nuclei are observed across sensory modalities. Analysis of burst
spiking in the TRN is limited to visual modality. This raises the question of whether distinctions in burst spiking are recognizable in TRN
cells of another sensory modality. To address this question, the present study examined activities of TRN auditory cells, focusing on the

features of burst spiking and the targets of axonal projection. Experiments were performed on anesthetized rats and data were obtained
from the two types of auditory cells projecting to ﬁrst- and higherorder auditory thalamic nuclei. The results indicated not only distinctions in burst spiking between the two types of auditory cells but also
variations of burst spiking related to the topographies of cell body
and terminal ﬁeld locations. These features of burst spiking are similar to those observed in visual cells (Kimura et al., 2012b). Burst
spiking of TRN cells is anatomically structured in a similar manner
across sensory modalities to exert differential controls over information processing in the lemniscal and non-lemniscal sensory systems.

Materials and methods
Animals and surgical preparation
Experiments were performed on 40 adult male Wistar rats (Kiwa
Laboratory Animal, Wakayama, Japan) weighing 270–355 g (mean,
325 g). All studies were carried out in accordance with the approved
institutional animal care and use protocol of the Animal Research
Committee of Wakayama Medical University. All experiments conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals and the guidelines on the ethical use of
animals of the Japanese Government Notiﬁcation.
Animals received an initial intraperitoneal (i.p.) bolus injection of
pentobarbital (5–8 mg/100 g body weight). This was followed by
continuous injections of chloral hydrate (4–6 mg/100 g body
weight/h, i.p.) and pentobarbital (0.5–0.8 mg/100 g body weight/h,
i.p.) through a cannula placed in the abdomen, using a microinjection pump (CFV-2100; Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) to avoid supplemental bolus injections and minimize ﬂuctuations of anesthetic
levels. The animals were maintained in an areﬂexic state throughout
the experiment. The animals were mounted on a stereotaxic apparatus. To avoid damage to the tympanic membrane, hollow ear bars
with blunted tips were used. The cisterna magna was incised to
reduce edema and pulsations of the brain. A local anesthetic (2%
xylocaine) was inﬁltrated in all surgical wounds.
A burr hole was made in the skull and dura (anteroposterior, 2.5–
5.0 mm posterior to bregma; mediolateral, 2.4–4.6 mm lateral to
midline). This allowed access to the TRN by a vertical insertion of
glass capillary into the brain for recording unit discharges and
injecting biocytin (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) or neurobiotin
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). A glass capillary (tip
diameter, ~2.5 lm; impedance, 7–21 MO) was ﬁlled with 2–5% biocytin or neurobiotin dissolved in 0.5 M saline.

noise burst stimuli (inter-stimulus interval, 2–3 s) were delivered to
record the unit discharges for data analysis. Recording time was
1000 ms per stimulus, including a 0- to 200-ms pre-stimulus recording
time. In a subset of cases spontaneous unit discharges were recorded
for 3 min in a state with a steady ambient noise level (≤ 51 dB). Sound
intensity was measured using a 1/4-inch condenser microphone (Type
4939; Br€
uel and Kjaer, Tokyo, Japan). At the end of recording, biocytin or neurobiotin was injected by delivering anodal current (3–23 nA,
200 ms on and 200 ms off) for 2–20 min (Pinault, 1996). Following
completion of injection, the capillary was removed and the wound was
closed. The animals were given post-operative care.
Histology
After a survival period of 3–6 h, the animals were deeply anesthetized with an overdose of pentobarbital (150 mg/kg body weight,
i.p.) and transcardially perfused with 300 mL of 0.9% saline containing heparin (300 IU), followed by 300 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1–0.3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate
buffer (PB, pH 7.4). Brains were removed from the skull and postﬁxed overnight in the same ﬁxative. After storage at 4 °C in 30%
sucrose, 0.1 M PB for 3–4 days, the frozen brains were cut at a
thickness of 70 lm in the coronal plane with a freezing microtome.
The sections were incubated in 1.5% H2O2 in 10 mM PB and saline
(PBS) for 1 h to suppress endogenous peroxidase activity. All
sections were then incubated in 10 mM PBS containing avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex (ABC Elite; Vector Laboratories) and 0.5%
Triton X-100 at room temperature for 4 h (Horikawa & Armstrong,
1988). After bathing in 0.1 M Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5%
cobalt acetate for 10 min, the sections were processed with 0.04%
diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) (Sigma), 0.015% H2O2
and ammonium nickel sulfate in 0.1 M Tris buffer at room temperature for 15–20 min to visualize labeling. The sections were then
washed twice for 10 min in distilled water.
The sections were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides and
every fourth section was stained with neutral red. Labeling was
observed under a light microscope (BX41; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan)
and drawn with the aide of a camera lucida. Digital images were
acquired at 40 9 (numerical aperture, 0.10) or 200 9 (numerical
aperture, 0.40) through a CCD camera with 1.4 million pixels (HC300Z; Fujiﬁlm, Tokyo, Japan) attached to the microscope and stored
on a computer. The drawings and images were analysed and prepared for publication using Canvas (Deneba Software, Miami, FL,
USA) and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Tokyo, Japan). The
parcellation and nomenclature of the thalamic nuclei followed those
of Paxinos & Watson (1997).

Stimulation and recording
Noise bursts (white noise; intensity, 70-dB SPL at the ear; duration,
100 ms including 5-ms rise and fall time) were digitally generated
(100 kHz) and converted to analog voltage signals (PCI-MIO-16XE10; National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) and delivered from a freeﬁeld speaker (SRS-A41; Sony, Tokyo, Japan) placed lateral to the ear
contralateral to the recording site. A glass capillary was vertically
advanced from the cortical surface to the TRN with a micro-step driver
(PC-5N; Narishige, Tokyo, Japan), monitoring neural responses to
sound. Recordings were ampliﬁed (9 10 000), ﬁltered (300–
2000 Hz), digitized (20 kHz) through an A-D converter (PCI-MIO16XE-10; National Instruments) and stored on a computer for data
analysis using custom-made programs (LabVIEW; National Instruments). When juxtacellularly recorded large unit discharges
(> 0.5 mV) responding to sound were obtained, a series of 20–100

Data analysis
Auditory response and spontaneous activity included single spikes
and trains of spikes (bursts) that appeared repetitively in the majority
of recordings. Features of auditory response and spontaneous activity
were analysed with regard to the numbers (per second in a post-stimulus recording of auditory response and per second in the whole
recording of spontaneous activity) of all discharge events (single
spikes and bursts) and all spikes (single spikes and spikes in bursts),
the incidence (%) of burst spiking in the all discharge events, the
number of spikes composing a burst, and the averaged and ﬁrst
inter-spike intervals (ISIs) of spikes in a burst. Additionally, the minimum peak response latency of discharge was measured in primary
auditory response and autocorrelation function of spikes was calculated in spontaneous activity. Unit discharges evoked with latencies

< 100 ms (duration of sound stimulation) were deﬁned as primary
response that is considered to represent cell activity (onset response)
directly driven by auditory input (Kimura, 2014). Late (≥ 100 ms)
response repeatedly evoked after the end of sound stimulation was
designated as non-primary response. Burst was deﬁned as a train of
spikes with ISIs that do not exceed 10 ms (Shosaku et al., 1989;
Sumitomo et al., 1989; Hartings et al., 2003; Llinas & Steriade,
2006; Kimura et al., 2012b). Bursts isolated solely based on the
maximum ISI are considered to include bursts generated on lowthreshold calcium spike (LTS) (LTS bursts) and high-frequency trains
of single spikes (Lu et al., 1992). Putative LTS bursts were then isolated as those that were preceded by periods (≥ 100 ms) of quiescence of discharge (Lu et al., 1992; Ramcharan et al., 2005; Llinas
& Steriade, 2006). As clusters of spiking with longer ISIs
(mostly < 20 ms) and shorter preceding periods (mostly ≥ 50 ms) of
quiescence discharge were observed in a subset of cases, as has been
documented in previous studies (Domich et al., 1986; Shosaku et al.,
1989; Sumitomo et al., 1989), data analysis was also performed, isolating bursts with ISIs < 20 ms and putative LTS bursts with preceding quiescent periods (QPs) ≥ 50 ms. Data are expressed as the
mean Æ SD. Comparisons of data were performed using Student’s ttest. Bonferonni adjustment was applied to multiple comparisons in
the datasets of the incidences of event and spike, the features (the
percentage of burst spiking in discharge events, the number of spikes
composing a burst, and the averaged and ﬁrst ISIs in a burst) of burst
spiking, the spike widths and the locations of cell bodies and terminal ﬁelds, and multiple correlations in the topographies of axonal
projections and the properties of burst spiking associated with the
two- and three-dimensional locations of cell bodies and terminal
ﬁelds. P values are expressed as corrected values. Difference was
considered signiﬁcant when corrected P values were < 0.05.
The locations of labeled cell bodies and terminal ﬁelds were
examined to determine the topography of axonal projections of
labeled cells and the relationships between the features of cell activity and the locations of labeled cell bodies and terminal ﬁelds. The
location of a labeled cell along the rostrocaudal neural axis was
deﬁned as the distance (mm) from bregma of a coronal tissue section containing the labeled cell. The dorsoventral location of a
labeled cell in the coronal plane of the TRN was expressed as the
ratio (D-V) of the distance (a) from the most lateral edge of the
TRN to the whole length (b) of the dorsal or ventral blade of the
part of the TRN that contained the labeled cell (see left inset in Fig.
7A). Labeled cells were further classiﬁed into two types, those
located in the lateral and medial sides (tiers) of the midline of the
TRN. When it was difﬁcult to determine the location of a labeled
cell, the case was deﬁned as a cell located in the middle part. The
location of a terminal ﬁeld in the ventral (MGV) or dorsal division
(MGD) of the medial geniculate nucleus along the rostrocaudal neural axis was deﬁned as the distance (mm) from bregma of a coronal
tissue section containing the densest labeling. To determine the location of a terminal ﬁeld in the coronal plane of the MGV, the distance of the terminal ﬁeld (the center of labeling) from the dorsal or
medial boundary of the MGV was measured. The two-dimensional
location of the terminal ﬁeld was then expressed as the ratio of the
distance to the whole dorsoventral or mediolateral span of the MGV
(Kimura et al., 2007).

Results
Data analysis was based on 48 juxtacellularlly recorded TRN cells
that responded to noise burst stimuli and sent axonal projections terminating in the MGV (TRN-MGV cell, n = 26) or MGD (TRN-

MGD cell, n = 22). A case in which a cell body was not identiﬁed
but a labeled terminal ﬁeld was clearly observed in the MGV was
included in the TRN-MGV cell group. Spontaneous activity was further recorded in a subset of cases (12 TRN-MGV and 13 TRNMGD cells). Auditory response and spontaneous activity were analysed for comparisons between TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell
groups, focusing on the features of burst spiking.
Representative TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cells
A cell (case 011613-5) located in the lateral tier of the ventral sector
of the TRN at 3.75 mm posterior to bregma (Fig. 1A) sent an axonal projection terminating in the ventromedial part of the MGV at
5.55 mm posterior to bregma (Figs 1A and 3A). Noise burst stimuli
elicited clusters of unit discharges that appeared approximately three
to ﬁve times in an 850-ms post-stimulus recording (recording trace
and raster in Fig. 1A). The minimum peak response latency of unit
discharges was 10.93 ms. Oscillatory activation observed in auditory
response was not apparent in spontaneous activity (autocorrelation
function in Fig. 1B). The incidences of single spikes and bursts
were analysed in all discharge events (cyan bars in the two bar
graphs of Fig. 1C) and discharge events with preceding
QPs ≥ 100 ms (magenta bars). The major component of discharge
events was burst spiking and the numbers of spikes composing a
burst mostly ranged between six and ten in the two types of discharge events.
A cell (case 031512-8) located in the medial tier of the TRN at
4.0 mm posterior to bregma (Fig. 2A) sent an axonal projection terminating in the middle part of the MGD at 5.29 mm posterior to
bregma (Figs 2A and 3B). This cell was also activated repeatedly
by noise burst stimuli (recording trace and raster in Fig. 2A). The
minimum peak response latency of unit discharges was 18.89 ms.
Oscillatory activity was not observed in spontaneous activity (autocorrelation function in Fig. 2B). In contrast to the dominance of
burst spiking in case 011613-5 (Fig. 1C), the major component of
discharge events was single spikes (bar graphs in Fig. 2C). The
numbers of spikes composing a burst mostly ranged between four
and eight. ISIs (magniﬁed recording trace in Fig. 2A) were longer
than those observed in case 011613-5 (magniﬁed recording trace in
Fig. 1A).
ISI (inter-spike intervals to preceding and subsequent spikes designated here as ‘ISIs Before’ and ‘ISIs After’, respectively) plots
(Fig. 4A) were made from recordings of auditory response (white
circles) and spontaneous activity (blue circles). Additionally, ‘ISIs
After’ of the ﬁrst spikes in auditory responses were plotted (red circles) together with their response latencies that were used as
abscissa values instead of ‘ISIs Before’. In case 011613-5 (TRNMGV cell) there was a cluster of plots indicating bursts preceded by
QPs (ISIs Before) ≥ 100 ms in both auditory response and spontaneous activity. ‘ISIs After’ were all < 10 ms when ‘ISIs Before’
were ≥ 100 ms. In case 031512-8 (TRN-MGD cell) the ‘ISIs
Before’ (QPs) of a comparable cluster of plots were relatively short
and some of them were < 100 ms. The comparable ‘ISIs After’
were relatively long and some of them exceeded 10 ms. These features of ISI were generally observed in the TRN-MGV and TRNMGD cell groups, respectively. A discrete cluster of plots with ‘ISIs
Before’ ≥ 100 ms and ‘ISIs After’ < 10 ms was observed in 21 out
of 26 TRN-MGV cells and seven out of 22 TRN-MGD cells.
LTS bursts of TRN cells are characterized by preceding QPs and
the following peculiar pattern of ISIs in a burst (intra-burst ISI): an
initial progressive decrease in ISI followed by a progressive increase
in ISI (Domich et al., 1986; Hartings et al., 2003; Llinas &

Steriade, 2006). The relationship between the order and length of
ISIs in a burst (Fig. 4B) indicated the peculiar pattern (magniﬁed
recording traces in Figs 1A and 2A) in the most frequently observed
bursts with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms in auditory response and spontaneous activity (black and blue lines in the two upper graphs in
Fig. 4B). The ﬁrst bursts elicited within 100 ms after the onset of
noise burst stimuli also exhibited the same peculiar pattern (red
lines). The peculiar pattern was recognized irrespective of the number of spikes composing a burst in both auditory response (data not
shown) and spontaneous activity (two lower graphs in Fig. 4B). On
the basis of these ﬁndings, the bursts with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms
were considered to be LTS bursts (Llinas & Steriade, 2006). The
peculiar pattern was observed in 25 out of 26 TRN-MGV and 20
out of 22 TRN-MGD cells. In the other three cells, ﬁrst ISIs were
shorter than second ISIs in both auditory response and spontaneous
activity.

Distinctions in the features of auditory response and
spontaneous activity between TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell
groups
In the whole auditory response (primary and non-primary responses)
(Table 1), the number of all spikes elicited by a noise burst stimulus
in the TRN-MGV cell group was larger (t46 = 3.87, P = 0.0007)
than that in the TRN-MGD cell group (ordinate values in Fig. 5A),
while there was no signiﬁcant difference (t46 = 0.77, P = 0.8863) in
the number of all discharge events between the TRN-MGV and
TRN-MGD cell groups (abscissa values in Fig. 5A). The difference
in the number of all spikes was ascribed to a higher (t46 = 3.17,
P = 0.0107) incidence of burst spiking and a larger (t46 = 4.30,
P = 0.0004) number of spikes composing a burst in the TRN-MGV
cell group as compared with those in the TRN-MGD cell group
(abscissa values in Fig. 5B). Averaged intra-burst ISI in the TRN-

MGV cell group was shorter (t46 = 4.51, P = 0.0002) than that in
the TRN-MGD cell group (ordinate values in Fig. 5B). First intraburst ISI in the TRN-MGV cell group was also shorter (t46 = 3.93,
P = 0.0011) than that in the TRN-MGD cell group. Data analysis
limited to discharge events with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms in nonprimary response (Table 1 and Fig. 5C) also indicated similar differences in the number of spikes (t46 = 3.77, P = 0.0009), the incidence of burst spiking (t46 = 3.67, P = 0.0025), the number of
spikes composing a burst (t46 = 3.75, P = 0.0020) (abscissa values
in Fig. 5C), and averaged (t46 = 4.49, P = 0.0002) (ordinate values
in Fig. 5C) and ﬁrst intra-burst ISIs (t46 = 4.25, P = 0.0004)
between the TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell groups. In spontaneous
activity (Table 2), there were no differences in the numbers of all
discharge events (t23 = 0.87, P = 0.7914) and spikes (t23 = 0.27,
P = 1) between the TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell groups
(Fig. 5D). The incidence of burst spiking in the TRN-MGV cell
group did not differ (t23 = 1.54, P = 0.5501) from that in the TRN-

MGD cell group. The number of spikes composing a burst in the
TRN-MGV cell group tended to be larger than that in the TRNMGD cell group (abscissa values in Fig. 5E), and averaged (ordinate values in Fig. 5E) and ﬁrst intra-burst ISIs in the TRN-MGV
cell group tended to be shorter than those in the TRN-MGD cell
group; however, these differences were not statistically signiﬁcant
(t23 = 2.39, 2.49 and 2.47, P = 0.1017, 0.0811 and 0.0846). In data
analysis limited to discharge events with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms
(Table 2 and Fig. 5F), there were no signiﬁcant differences in the
numbers of discharge events (t23 = 0.13, P = 1) and spikes
(t23 = 1.03, P = 0.6288), the incidence of burst spiking (t23 = 1.76,
P = 0.3703), the number of spikes composing a burst (t23 = 1.80,
P = 0.3391), and averaged (t23 = 2.28, P = 0.1278) and ﬁrst intraburst ISIs (t23 = 2.39, P = 0.1014) between the TRN-MGV and
TRN-MGD cell groups. In summary, TRN-MGV cells had higher
propensities for burst spiking and exhibited bursts of larger numbers
of spikes with shorter ISIs as compared with TRN-MGD cells in

auditory response (Table 1). Similar tendencies were observed in
spontaneous activity (Table 2).
There were correlations between the numbers of all discharge
events and all spikes in both auditory response (TRN-MGV cell
group, r24 = 0.77, P = 0.0002; TRN-MGD cell group, r20 = 0.51,

cell group, r11 = 0.70, P = 0.0124) (Figs 5A and D). The slope of
the regression line in the TRN-MGV cell group differed from that
in the TRN-MGD cell group in auditory response (t44 = 2.49,
P = 0.0166) but not in spontaneous activity (t21 = 0.93,
P = 0.3653). Similar correlations were observed in data analysis
limited to discharge events with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms in nonprimary response (TRN-MGV cell group, r24 = 0.87, P = 0.0002;
TRN-MGD-cell group, r20 = 0.61, P = 0.0036) and spontaneous
activity (TRN-MGV cell group, r10 = 0.77, P = 0.0046; TRNMGD-cell group, r11 = 0.65, P = 0.0298) (data not shown). The
slope of the regression line in the TRN-MGV cell group also differed from that in the TRN-MGD cell group in auditory response
(t44 = 2.05, P = 0.0468) but not in spontaneous activity (t21 = 0.16,
P = 0.8776). With regard to the features of burst spiking in auditory
response (Figs 5B and C), the numbers of spikes composing a burst
in all bursts correlated with averaged intra-burst ISIs in both the
TRN-MGV (r24 = À0.75, P = 0.0004; Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient test) and TRN-MGD cell groups (r20 = À0.73, P = 0.0004):
averaged intra-burst ISIs became shorter as the numbers of spikes
composing a burst increased (Fig. 5B). The slope of the regression
line in the TRN-MGV cell group did not differ from that in the
TRN-MGD cell group (t44 = 1.36, P = 0.1799). The numbers of
spikes composing a burst also had a similar correlation
(r24 = À0.50, P = 0.0320) with ﬁrst intra-burst ISIs in the TRNMGV cell group but not (r20 = À0.36, P = 0.4184) in the TRNMGD cell group (data not shown). In data analysis limited to burst

spiking with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms in non-primary response
(Fig. 5C), similar correlations between the number of spikes composing a burst and averaged intra-burst ISI were observed in the
TRN-MGV (r24 = À0.75, P = 0.0004) and TRN-MGD cell groups
(r20 = À0.65, P = 0.0032), and there was no difference in the slope
of the regression line between the TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell
groups (t44 = 0.25, P = 0.8051). The numbers of spikes composing
a burst also tended to correlate with ﬁrst intra-burst ISIs
(r24 = À0.44, P = 0.0984) in the TRN-MGV group (data not
shown). In spontaneous activity (Figs 5E and F), the numbers of
spikes composing a burst in all bursts correlated with averaged
(r10 = À0.90, P = 0.0004) and ﬁrst intra-burst ISIs (r10 = À0.82,
P = 0.0020) only in the TRN-MGV cell group (Fig. 5E). Similar
correlations (the number of spikes – averaged ISI, r10 = À0.90,
P = 0.0004; the number of spikes – ﬁrst ISI, r10 = À0.81,
P = 0.0028) were also observed in the TRN-MGV cell group when
data analysis was limited to bursts with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms
(Fig. 5F). In summary, the features of correlation between the numbers of discharge events and spikes differed between the TRN-MGV
and TRN-MGD cell groups in auditory response (Fig. 5A) due to
the higher propensities for more intense burst spiking in the TRNMGV cell group (Table 1). This difference was not recognized in
spontaneous activity (Fig. 5D). The features of correlation between
the numbers and ISIs of spikes composing burst spiking were similar between the TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell groups in auditory
response (Figs 5B and C). This similarity was not replicated in
spontaneous activity (Figs 5E and F).
Spike width (combined widths of positive and negative deﬂections) was measured at single spikes, and the averaged and ﬁrst
spikes of burst spiking in spontaneous activity. There were no differences (single spike, t21 = 0.09, P = 1; averaged spike, t23 = 0.13,
P = 1; ﬁrst spike, t23 = 0.12, P = 1) in spike width between the
TRN-MGV (single spike, 1.07 Æ 0.26 ms; averaged spike,
1.09 Æ 0.27 ms; ﬁrst spike, 1.08 Æ 0.26 ms) and TRN-MGD (single spike, 1.06 Æ 0.15 ms; averaged spike, 1.08 Æ 0.14 ms; ﬁrst
spike, 1.07 Æ 0.14 ms) cell groups.
The minimum peak response latency of unit discharges was determined in 18 TRN-MGV and 18 TRN-MGD cells. In the other cells,
the peak response latency could not be determined because there
was no cell activity within 100 ms (two TRN-MGV cells) or a peak
of cell activity was not clear in primary response (six TRN-MGV
and four TRN-MGD cells). The minimum peak response latency
was signiﬁcantly shorter (t34 = 4.55, P < 0.0001) for the TRNMGV cell group (18.94 Æ 6.14 ms) than for the TRN-MGD cell
group (37.27 Æ 15.96 ms). In spontaneous activity, oscillation of 3–
4 Hz was observed in one case in each of the TRN-MGV and
TRN-MGD cell groups. There was no noticeable difference in the
pattern of spontaneous activity between the TRN-MGV and TRNMGD cell groups as represented in the auto-correlation functions of
cases 011613-5 and 031512-8 (Figs 1B and 2B).
Effects of sensory and recurrent activations on burst spiking
It is presumed that cortical and thalamic inputs to TRN cells are
repeatedly recruited following sensory stimulation (sensory activation) in the loop connections between cortical areas and thalamic
nuclei (Pinault, 2003). The recruited inputs are considered to drive
TRN cell activity after the end of sensory stimulation (recurrent activation) in conjunction with the intrinsically generated oscillatory
activation of TRN cells (Steriade et al., 1987). To compare the
effects of sensory and recurrent activations on burst spiking (Fig. 6),
the features (the number of spikes composing a burst and averaged

length) were observed in bursts preceded by QPs ≥ 100 ms in primary (red lines), non-primary auditory responses (black lines) and spontaneous activity (blue
lines). Lower graphs indicate intra-burst ISI proﬁles of all bursts preceded by QPs ≥ 100 ms in spontaneous activity.

which were assumed to represent burst spiking in cell activity
directly driven by auditory inputs ascending from thalamic nuclei
(Kimura, 2014), were compared (paired t-test) with those of burst

spiking in non-primary response (recurrent activation). Two cases in
the TRN-MGV cell group were excluded from this data analysis
because of the absence of discharge events in primary response.
There were no signiﬁcant differences (number of spikes, t23 = 0.46,

P = 1; averaged ISI, t23 = 0.17, P = 1) in the features of burst spiking in the TRN-MGV cell group (Figs 6A and B), while the numbers of spikes composing a burst were smaller (t21 = 2.45,
P = 0.0461) and averaged intra-burst ISIs tended to be longer
(t21 = 2.20, P = 0.0786) for burst spiking in primary response (sensory activation) in the TRN-MGD cell group (Figs 6C and D). Furthermore, the features of burst spiking in all bursts in non-primary
response were compared with those of burst spiking in spontaneous
activity so as to determine possible sustained effects of auditory
inputs on burst spiking in recurrent activation. In the TRN-MGV
cell group (n = 12), there were signiﬁcant differences when data
obtained from a peculiar case (white circles with asterisks in
Figs 6E and F) were excluded from data analysis: the numbers of
spikes composing a burst and averaged intra-burst ISIs were smaller
(t10 = 3.47, P = 0.0121) and longer (t10 = 3.34, P = 0.0149),
respectively, for burst spiking in recurrent activation. In the TRNMGD cell group (n = 13), there were no signiﬁcant differences
(number of spikes, t12 = 2.08, P = 0.1195; averaged ISI, t12 = 0.80,
P = 0.8836) (Figs 6G and H). The results were summarized as follows: sound stimulation sustainably affected the properties of burst
spiking of TRN-MGV cells in their non-primary responses (recurrent activation), whereas it transiently affected those of TRN-MGD
cells in their primary responses (direct sensory activation).
Locations of cell bodies and topographies of axonal
projections
Labeled cells were located mainly in the ventral sector of the TRN
from 3.3 to 4.5 mm posterior to bregma (Fig. 7A). The distributions
of TRN-MGV (n = 25) and TRN-MGD cells (n = 22) were biased
toward the rostroventral and caudodorsal sides, respectively: the
locations of TRN-MGV cells signiﬁcantly differed from those of
TRN-MGD cells along the rostrocaudal (t45 = 2.86, P = 0.0123)
and dorsoventral neural axes (t45 = 2.45, P = 0.0361). Many TRNMGV cells were located in the lateral tier (cells in the medial tier,
six; lateral tier, 14; middle, ﬁve), while TRN-MGD cells were primarily located in the medial tier (cells in the medial tier, 16; lateral
tier, four; middle two).
The locations of terminal ﬁelds in the three-dimensional extent
of the MGV and the rostrocaudal extent of the MGD were examined to determine the topographies of axonal projections. Axonal

projections were topographic in a similar manner along the rostrocaudal neural axis in the TRN-MGV (r23 = 0.56, P = 0.0180,
Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient test) and TRN-MGD cell groups
(r20 = 0.58, P = 0.0072): the more rostrally located cells sent axonal projections to the more rostral portions of the MGV and MGD
(Fig. 7B). As has been reported in a previous study (Kimura et al.,
2007), the more rostrally located TRN-MGV cells sent axonal projections to the more ventral portions of the MGV (r23 = 0.50,
P = 0.0618) and the more ventrally located TRN-MGV cells sent
axonal projections to the more ventral (r23 = 0.51, P = 0.0468)
and medial portions (r23 = 0.70, P = 0.0006) of the MGV (data
not shown). The dorsoventral locations of cell bodies did not correlate with the rostrocaudal locations of terminal ﬁelds in both the
TRN-MGV (r23 = 0.03, P = 1) and the TRN-MGD cell groups
(r20 = 0.003, P = 1).
Correlations between the features of burst spiking and the
locations of cell bodies and terminal fields
In light of the correlations between the features of burst spiking and
the locations of cell bodies and terminal ﬁelds in TRN visual cells
(Kimura et al., 2012b), we examined relationships between the features (number of spikes composing a burst, and averaged and ﬁrst
intra-burst ISIs) of burst spiking and the locations of cell bodies and
terminal ﬁelds in TRN auditory cells (Fig. 8). The numbers of
spikes composing a burst correlated with the rostrocaudal locations
of cell bodies (Figs 8A and E) and terminal ﬁelds in the TRN-MGD
cell group (Figs 8C and F): the numbers of spikes composing a
burst in all bursts increased as cell bodies or terminal ﬁelds were
more rostrally located in both the whole auditory response (cell
body, r20 = 0.72, P = 0.0006; terminal ﬁeld, r20 = 0.74,
P = 0.0003; Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient test) and spontaneous
activity (cell body, r11 = 0.79, P = 0.0036; terminal ﬁeld,
r11 = 0.70, P = 0.0201). Similar results were obtained from data
analysis of bursts with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms in non-primary
response (cell body, r20 = 0.71, P = 0.0006; terminal ﬁeld,
r20 = 0.73, P = 0.0003) and spontaneous activity (cell body,
r11 = 0.79, P = 0.0036; terminal ﬁeld, r11 = 0.75, P = 0.0066) (data
not shown). In the TRN-MGV cell group, ﬁrst intra-burst ISIs of all
bursts in the whole auditory response tended to correlate
(r23 = À0.42, P = 0.0714) with the rostrocaudal locations of cell
bodies (Fig. 8B), and ﬁrst (data not shown) and averaged intra-burst
ISIs (Fig. 8D) of all bursts in the whole auditory response correlated
(r24 = À0.56, P = 0.0243; r24 = À0.65, P = 0.0018) with the rostrocaudal locations of terminal ﬁelds: intra-burst ISIs became
shorter as cell bodies or terminal ﬁelds were more rostrally located.
Similar correlations were found in bursts with preceding
QPs ≥ 100 ms in non-primary auditory response (ﬁrst ISI – cell
body, r23 = À0.52, P = 0.0444; ﬁrst ISI – terminal ﬁeld,
r24 = À0.62, P = 0.0054; averaged ISI – terminal ﬁeld,
r24 = À0.54, P = 0.0306) (data not shown). Averaged ISIs of TRNMGD cells also tended to be shorter (r20 = À0.48, P = 0.0669) as
their terminal ﬁelds were more rostrally located in their bursts with
preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms in non-primary auditory response (data not
shown). There were no correlations between intra-burst ISIs and the
locations of cell bodies and terminal ﬁelds in spontaneous activity.
In summary, the ISIs and numbers of spikes in burst spiking correlated with the locations of cell bodies and terminal ﬁelds in the
TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell groups, respectively: the more rostrally located TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cells projecting to the
more rostral portions of the MG showed the more intense burst
spiking in terms of the density (TRN-MGV cells) and number of

Fig. 5. Features of auditory responses (A–C) and spontaneous activities (D–F) in the TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell groups. (A) In the whole auditory
response, TRN-MGV cells (white circles) showed higher spike rates per noise burst stimulus (ordinate) than TRN-MGD cells (black circles), although there was
no difference in the incidence of discharge events (abscissa). The numbers of discharge events and those of spikes were correlated in both the TRN-MGV and
the TRN-MGD cell groups (continuous regression lines). The slope of the regression line in the TRN-MGV cell group differed from that in the TRN-MGD cell
group. (B,C) TRN-MGV cells showed bursts with larger numbers of spikes and shorter averaged ISIs in all bursts in the whole auditory response and bursts
with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms in non-primary auditory response. The numbers of spikes and averaged ISIs in bursts were correlated in both the TRN-MGV and
the TRN-MGD cell groups (continuous regression lines). The slopes of the regression lines in the TRN-MGV cell group did not differ from those in the TRNMGD cell group. (D) In spontaneous activities, there were no differences in the numbers of discharge events and spikes between the TRN-MGV and TRNMGD cell groups. The numbers of discharge events and those of spikes were correlated in both the TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD groups (continuous regression
lines). There was no difference in the slope of the regression line between the TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell groups. (E) Averaged ISIs in the TRN-MGV cell
group tended to be shorter than those in the TRN-MGD cell group in all bursts; however, this was not statistically signiﬁcant. There were no differences in the
number of spikes composing a burst (abscissa in E and F) and averaged ISI in bursts with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms (ordinate in F) between the TRN-MGV
and TRN-MGD cell groups. The numbers of spikes and averaged ISIs were correlated in the TRN-MGV cell group (continuous regression lines) but not in the

spikes (TRN-MGD cells) composing a burst. In the TRN-MGV cell
group the correlations were observed only in auditory response,
while in the TRN-MGD cell group the correlations were observed
in both auditory response and spontaneous activity.

Correlations between the features of burst spiking and the

et al., 2012b; Kimura, 2014). The present and previous results
(Kimura et al., 2012b) indicated that there are correlations between
the features of burst spiking and the rostrocaudal locations of cell
bodies in both auditory and visual cells. It was suggested therefore
that there could be a common structural basis that correlates the features (number of spikes composing a burst and averaged intra-burst
ISI) of burst spiking with the rostrocaudal locations of cell bodies
across sensory modalities. The relationships between the features of
burst spiking in spontaneous activity and the rostrocaudal locations
of cell bodies were examined in a database of auditory (n = 24) and
visual cells (n = 15) that included the two types of cells projecting
to ﬁrst- and higher-order thalamic nuclei. Data of visual cells (six
and nine visual cells projecting to the DLG and LP) were obtained
from a previous study (Kimura et al., 2012b). The numbers of
spikes composing a burst correlated with the rostrocaudal locations
of cell bodies in both auditory cells (all bursts, r22 = 0.53,
P = 0.0414; bursts with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms, r22 = 0.56,
P = 0.0234; Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient test) and visual cells
(r13 = 0.75, P = 0.0048; r13 = 0.73, P = 0.0084): cells located in
the more rostral side exhibited burst spiking with the larger numbers
of spikes (Fig. 9A). The slope of the regression line in auditory cells
did not differ from that in visual cells (all bursts, t35 = 0.10,
P = 0.9235; bursts with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms, t35 = 0.04,
P = 0.9652), and strong correlations (all bursts, r37 = 0.66,
P = 0.0006; bursts with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms, r37 = 0.66,
P = 0.0006) were calculated when the data of auditory and visual
cells were combined. Averaged intra-burst ISIs tended to be shorter
in the more rostrally located visual cells (all bursts, r13 = À0.64,
P = 0.0546; bursts with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms, r13 = À0.64,
P = 0.0534) (Fig. 9B). Although there was no correlation in auditory cells (all bursts, r22 = À0.43, P = 0.2202; bursts with preceding QPs ≥ 100 ms, r22 = À0.44, P = 0.1914), strong correlations
(all bursts, r37 = À0.46, P = 0.0162; bursts with preceding
QPs ≥ 100 ms, r37 = À0.48, P = 0.0102) were calculated when the
data of auditory and visual cells were combined.
Burst spiking with long intra-burst ISIs and short preceding
QPs
In a subset of cases (ﬁve TRN-MGV and 15 TRN-MGD cells) there
were trains of spikes with ISIs exceeding 10 ms, some of which
were preceded by QPs shorter than 100 ms (right graph in Fig. 4A).

It was suggested therefore that some bursts could have intra-burst
ISIs and preceding QPs out of the ranges applied to detect burst
spiking in the above data analysis (Domich et al., 1986; Shosaku
et al., 1989; Sumitomo et al., 1989). In view of the ﬁnding that in
most cases possible long intra-burst ISIs did not exceed 20 ms and
possible short preceding QPs were over 50 ms (right graph in
Fig. 4A), data were analysed again, detecting trains of spikes with
ISIs < 20 ms as bursts, which, when preceded by QPs ≥ 50 ms,
were then considered to represent LTS bursts. As a result, putative
LTS bursts with preceding QPs ≥ 50 ms were found to have the
pattern of intra-burst ISIs (an initial progressive decrease followed
by a progressive increase of ISI) peculiar to LTS burst in both auditory response and spontaneous activity (Fig. 10A). The same three
cells showed an exceptional pattern of intra-burst ISIs (ﬁrst ISIs
shorter than second ISIs).
Results (data not shown) similar to those in the above data analysis were obtained with regard to the numbers of discharge events
and spikes (data analyses comparable to those indicated in Figs 5A
and D). There were no differences in the numbers of all discharge
events and events with preceding QPs ≥ 50 ms between the TRNMGV and TRN-MGD cell groups in both auditory response and
spontaneous activity (Table 3). The number of spikes in discharge
events with preceding QPs ≥ 50 ms in the TRN-MGV cell group
differed (t46 = 3.47, P = 0.0023) from that in the TRN-MGD cell
group in auditory response, but not in spontaneous activity. The
slope of the regression line in the relationship between the numbers
of discharge events and spikes in the TRN-MGV cell group also differed (t44 = 2.58, P = 0.0134) from that in the TRN-MGD cell
group in all discharge events in the whole auditory response but not
in discharge events with preceding QPs ≥ 50 ms in non-primary
response. Like the results in the above data analysis (Table 1,
Figs 5B and C) the features of burst spiking in the TRN-MGV cell
group were distinct from those in the TRN-MGD cell group in auditory response (Table 3): all bursts and bursts with preceding
QPs ≥ 50 ms in the TRN-MGV cell group appeared at higher incidences (all bursts, t46 = 3.47, P = 0.0046; bursts with preceding
QPs ≥ 50 ms, t46 = 3.28, P = 0.0079) and were composed of larger
numbers of spikes (all bursts, t46 = 4.33, P = 0.0003; bursts with
preceding QPs ≥ 50 ms, t46 = 3.95, P = 0.0011) with shorter averaged ISIs (all bursts, t46 = 4.30, P = 0.0004; bursts with preceding
QPs ≥ 50 ms, t46 = 4.24, P = 0.0004) and ﬁrst ISIs (all bursts,
t46 = 3.98, P = 0.0010; bursts with preceding QPs ≥ 50 ms,
t46 = 4.23, P = 0.0004) as compared with all bursts and bursts with
preceding QPs ≥ 50 ms in the TRN-MGD cell group (left graph in
Fig. 10B). The results with regard to the correlation (all bursts in

to those in the above data analysis (Fig. 5B and C). In spontaneous
activity (Table 3), there was no difference in the incidence of burst
spiking, the number of spikes composing a burst and averaged intraburst ISI between the TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell groups (right

group tended to differ (all bursts, t23 = 2.44, P = 0.0911; bursts
with preceding QPs ≥ 50 ms, t23 = 2.41, P = 0.0975) from those in
TRN-MGD cell group.

Fig. 6. Features of burst spiking in sensory and recurrent activations. There were no differences in the features of burst spiking in all bursts between primary
and non-primary responses (sensory and recurrent activations) in the TRN-MGV cell group (A and B), while in the TRN-MGD cell group the numbers of
spikes composing a burst and averaged intra-burst ISIs in primary response were smaller and longer than those in non-primary response (C and D). In the
TRN-MGV cell group the numbers of spikes composing a burst and averaged intra-burst ISIs in non-primary response were smaller and longer than those in
spontaneous activity except in a peculiar case (asterisks) (E and F), while there were no differences between non-primary response and spontaneous activity in
the TRN-MGD cell group (G and H).

In comparisons (paired t-test) between the features of burst spiking in all discharge events of primary response and those of burst
spiking in all discharge events of non-primary response (data analyses comparable to those indicated in Figs 6A–D), a similar differ-

ence (smaller numbers of spikes composing a burst in primary
response), although not statistically signiﬁcant (t21 = 2.24,
P = 0.0720), was observed only in the number of spikes composing
a burst in the TRN-MGD cell group. In comparisons between the

indicated in Figs 8C, D and F), the numbers of spikes composing a
burst correlated (all bursts in auditory response, r20 = 0.70,
P = 0.0006; bursts with preceding QPs ≥ 50 ms in non-primary
auditory response, r20 = 0.70, P = 0.0006; all bursts in spontaneous

QPs ≥ 50 ms, r11 = 0.73, P = 0.0105) with the rostrocaudal locations of terminal ﬁelds in the TRN-MGD cell group, as with the
results in the above data analysis, but correlations (all bursts in auditory response, r24 = À0.58, P = 0.0126; bursts with preceding quiescent in non-primary auditory response, r24 = À0.53, P = 0.0423)
were observed only between ﬁrst ISIs and the rostrocaudal locations
of terminal ﬁelds in the TRN-MGV cell group, unlike the results in
the above data analysis.
In conclusion, similar results were obtained from the data analysis
of burst spiking with long intra-burst ISIs (< 20 ms) and short preceding QPs (≥ 50 ms): TRN-MGV cells had higher propensities for
burst spiking with larger numbers of spikes and shorter ISIs as compared with TRN-MGD cells in auditory response, and similar distinctions, although not statistically signiﬁcant, were observed in
spontaneous activity (Table 3 and Fig. 10). The results were also
similar with regard to the alterations of burst spiking in primary and
non-primary responses and the associations between the variations
of burst spiking and the topographies of cell body and terminal ﬁeld
locations.

Discussion

Figs 6E–H), similar signiﬁcant differences (smaller numbers of
spikes composing a burst and longer averaged ISIs in non-primary
auditory response) were observed in the number of spikes composing a burst (t10 = À3.41, P = 0.0132) and averaged ISI (t10 = 3.56,
P = 0.0103) of the TRN-MGV cell group when data from a peculiar
case (the same case noted in the above data analysis) were excluded
from data analysis.
With regard to the relationships between the features of burst
spiking and the locations of cell bodies (data analyses comparable
to those indicated in Figs 8A, B and E), the numbers of spikes composing a burst correlated (all bursts in auditory response, r20 = 0.72,
P = 0.0006; bursts with preceding QPs ≥ 50 ms in non-primary

in the above data analysis, but no correlation was observed between
ﬁrst ISIs and the rostrocaudal locations of cell bodies in the TRNMGV cell group, unlike the results in the above data analysis. With
regard to the relationships between the features of burst spiking and
the locations of terminal ﬁelds (data analyses comparable to those

The results are summarized as follows. In auditory response, TRNMGV cells had higher propensities for burst spiking and exhibited
bursts of larger numbers of spikes with shorter ISIs as compared
with TRN-MGD cells. Similar distinctions, although not statistically
different, were observed in spontaneous activity. The features of
burst spiking varied in association with the topographies of cell
body and terminal ﬁeld locations. Sound stimulation altered the features of burst spiking in non-primary responses of TRN-MGV cells
but not those of TRN-MGD cells. Similar ﬁndings have been
obtained from TRN visual cells projecting to the DLG and LP
(Kimura et al., 2012b). Therefore, it is postulated that TRN cells
projecting to ﬁrst- and higher-order thalamic nuclei have high and
low levels of burst spiking across sensory modalities, which contrast
with low and high levels of burst spiking in ﬁrst- (the MGV and
DLG) and higher-order (the MGD and LP) thalamic nuclei (He &
Hu, 2002; Ramcharan et al., 2005; Wei et al., 2011). Furthermore,
the features of burst spiking are associated with afferent and efferent
connectivities of the TRN in a similar manner across sensory modalities.
Distinctions in the features of burst spiking between TRN cells
projecting to first- and higher-order thalamic nuclei
In both auditory and visual modalities, high and low levels of
burst spiking are recognized in the two groups of TRN cells projecting to ﬁrst- and higher-order thalamic nuclei. A question arises
as to whether these distinct levels of burst spiking reﬂect differences in extrinsically conditioned states of synaptic activation or
differences in intrinsically determined cell membrane properties.
The present results seem to support the former possibility. The
slopes of regression lines of the number of spikes and ISI in the
TRN-MGV cell group did not differ from those in the TRN-MGD
cell group (Figs 5B, C, and 10B), suggesting that the two cell
groups have common cell membrane properties for burst spiking,
which could generate various levels of burst spiking depending on

Fig. 8. Relationships between the features of burst spiking and the locations of cell bodies and terminal ﬁelds. The numbers of spikes composing a burst in all
bursts correlated (continuous regression lines) with the rostrocaudal locations of TRN-MGD cells (black circles) in the whole auditory response (A) and spontaneous activity (E). There was a weak correlation (dotted regression line) between ﬁrst intra-burst ISIs in all bursts and the rostrocaudal locations of TRN-MGV
cells (white circles) in the whole auditory response (B). The numbers of spikes composing a burst in all bursts correlated (continuous regression lines) with the
rostrocaudal locations of terminal ﬁelds in the TRN-MGD cell group (black circles) in the whole auditory response (C) and spontaneous activity (F). There was
a correlation (continuous regression line) between averaged intra-burst ISIs in all bursts and the rostrocaudal locations of terminal ﬁelds in the TRN-MGV cell

the states of synaptic activation. Accordingly, the distinctions in
burst spiking between the two groups were apparent in auditory
response, i.e. at the moment of intense synaptic activation, but not
in spontaneous activity. Considering cell body locations and
response latencies, TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cells are highly
likely to receive auditory inputs from the MGV and MGD (Bordi
& LeDoux, 1994; Kimura et al., 2003, 2012a). The distinctions in
burst spiking could be then ascribed to differences in the impacts
of auditory inputs ascending through the MGV and MGD. Note,
however, that the distinctions in burst spiking were apparent in
non-primary as well as primary response and that similar distinc-

tions, although not statistically signiﬁcant, were observed in spontaneous activity. These ﬁndings suggest that TRN-MGV and TRNMGD cells were preconditioned to show distinct patterns of spiking in response to intense synaptic activation by auditory inputs.
The distinctions in burst spiking in visual cells, which appear more
remarkable than those in auditory cells, are apparent in spontaneous activity as well (Kimura et al., 2012b). This supports the possibility.
The distinctions in burst spiking were observed in putative LTS
bursts. As a hyperpolarized state is a prerequisite for a cell to generate LTS burst (Llinas & Steriade, 2006), it is postulated that

Fig. 9. Features of burst spiking associated with cell body locations across
auditory and visual modalities. (A) In spontaneous activity, the numbers of
spikes composing a burst in all bursts correlated (continuous regression lines)
with the rostrocaudal locations of cell bodies in both auditory and visual cell
groups (black and white circles). A higher correlation was calculated when
the data of auditory and visual cells were combined. (B) There was a weak
correlation (dotted regression line) between averaged intra-burst ISIs in all
bursts and the rostrocaudal locations of visual cells (white circles). Despite
the absence of a correlation in the auditory cell group (black circles), a statistically signiﬁcant correlation was calculated when the data of auditory and
visual cells were combined.

TRN-MGV cells are embedded in relatively hyperpolarized states
to show more frequently burst spiking (Sumitomo et al., 1989). On
the other hand, TRN-MGD cells could be embedded in relatively
depolarized states that hamper the generation of burst spiking. The
ﬁnding that the incidences of burst spiking in TRN-MGV and
TRN-MGD cell groups were high and low in the discharge events
preceded by QPs (another prerequisite for the generation of LTS
burst) also suggests that the states of TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD
cells were biased toward hyperpolarization and depolarization. As a
possibility, TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cells may be conditioned
to such different states under the barrages of excitatory inputs from
the MGV and MGD, which, with low and high levels of burst
spiking (He & Hu, 2002; Ramcharan et al., 2005), could depolar-

ize TRN cells in different manners. An important ﬁnding is that
sound stimulation altered burst spiking in non-primary responses of
TRN-MGV cells but not in those of TRN-MGD cells. Non-primary
response is considered to be driven by cortical and thalamic inputs
repeatedly recruited following sound stimulation in the thalamocortical loop (Steriade, 2006; Huguenard & McCormick, 2007; Jones,
2009) that interact with intrinsically generated oscillatory activation
of TRN cells (Steriade et al., 1987; Zaman et al., 2011). Effects of
light stimulation on burst spiking in non-primary response are also
observed in TRN visual cells projecting to the DLG but not in
those projecting to the LP (Kimura et al., 2012b). As such, across
sensory modalities, thalamocortical loop circuitries that include the
two types of TRN cells differ from each other in a similar manner
with regard to the temporal sensitivity to sensory activation. It
could be further assumed that the distinctions in burst spiking
between the two types of TRN cells represent the states of cell
activity differentially conditioned by the thalamocortical loop circuitries, probably in conjunction with mutual cell connectivity
inside the TRN (Landisman et al., 2002; Sohal & Huguenard,
2003; Sun et al., 2012).
It is possible that the distinctions in burst spiking derive from heterogeneous intrinsic membrane properties. In slice preparations cells
in the putative auditory and visual domains of the TRN are categorized into Typical-, Atypical- and Non-burst types that have heterogeneous membrane properties (Lee et al., 2007). In line with the
predominance of Typical-burst type in the putative auditory domain,
TRN cells examined in the present study are all likely to correspond
to Typical-burst type characterized by an initial decrease of intraburst ISI, except three cells which are considered to be Atypical
type characterized by an initial increase of intra-burst ISI. Therefore,
it seems plausible to postulate that TRN cells examined in the present study are virtually homogenous in terms of intrinsic membrane
properties, as also suggested by their identical spike widths (Lee
et al., 2007).
As pentobarbital alters cellular and/or circuitry propensity for
oscillation (Cotillon-Williams & Edeline, 2003) and burst spiking
(Massaux et al., 2004), it is unclear whether the distinctions in
burst spiking between the TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell groups
observed in the present results could be replicated as the aspects
of physiological function in non-anesthetized animals. It has been
shown, however, that pentobarbital does not affect the properties
(the number of spikes and ISI in a burst) of burst spiking in thalamic nuclei (Massaux & Edeline, 2003; Massaux et al., 2004).
The present and previous results (Kimura et al., 2012b) indicate
similar distinctions in burst spiking between TRN cells projecting
to ﬁrst- and higher-order thalamic nuclei across auditory and visual
modalities, although there is a clear difference in the density of
GABAergic interneurons in auditory and visual thalamic nuclei
(Winer & Larue, 1996) that could allow pentobarbital to affect
burst spiking of TRN auditory and visual cells in different manners
(Mehta & Ticku, 1999; Wan et al., 2003). The variations of burst
spiking associated with the topographies of cell body and terminal
ﬁeld locations in the present and previous results seem to signify
the presence of anatomical substrate rather than the inﬂuence of
anesthesia for the properties of burst spiking. As such, pentobarbital is less likely to characterize the properties of burst spiking in
the present and previous studies, suggesting the possibility that the
distinctions in burst spiking between the lemniscal and non-lemniscal systems could be recognized in the TRN as well as thalamic
nuclei (Ramcharan et al., 2005) of non-anesthetized animals. Further studies of non-anesthetized animals are needed to test this possibility.

Fig. 10. Features of burst spiking detected on the basis of a longer maximum ISI (20 ms) and a shorter minimum preceding QP (50 ms). (A) Similar intraburst ISI proﬁles (an initial progressive decrease followed by a progressive increase of length) were observed in bursts preceded by QPs ≥ 50 ms across primary, non-primary auditory responses and spontaneous activity (left graph). The proﬁles of intra-burst ISIs were consistently observed irrespective of the number of spikes composing a burst in spontaneous activity (right graph). (B) Bursts preceded by QPs ≥ 50 ms in non-primary auditory response (left graph) in the
TRN-MGV cell group (white circles) were composed of larger numbers of spikes with shorter averaged ISIs as compared with those in the TRN-MGD cell
group (black circles). There was no difference in the slope of the regression line between the TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell groups (continuous lines in left
graph). In the TRN-MGV cell group the numbers of spikes composing a burst correlated with averaged intra-burst ISIs (continuous line in right graph) in bursts
preceded by QPs ≥ 50 ms in spontaneous activity. There were no differences in the features of burst spiking between the TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell
groups in spontaneous activity.

Anatomically structured features of burst spiking
One might raise a concern about the possibility that the interpretation of the previous (Kimura et al., 2012b) and present results is
confounded with changes of brain state due to ﬂuctuations in the
levels of anesthesia and/or differences in the efﬁcacy of sensory
stimulation for evoking burst spiking. However, the association
between burst spiking and anatomical organization observed across
sensory modalities is thought to rule out this possibility. Fluctuations in the levels of anesthesia across recordings would not allow
us to observe the distinctions and variations in the features of burst
spiking that are associated with anatomical organization in a similar
manner across sensory modalities. Differences in the efﬁcacy of sensory stimulation are considered negligible for visual modality
because the distinctions and variations are recognized in spontaneous activity (Kimura et al., 2012b). Although the distinctions in
burst spiking between the TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell groups
were not obvious in spontaneous activity, the correlation between
burst spiking in spontaneous activity and anatomical organization
(Figs 8E and F) suggests that differences in the efﬁcacy of sound
stimulation are unlikely to make a distinction in burst spiking. For
the present study, tonotopy-based differential cell activation could
be another concern. Tonotopy is considered organized primarily
along the dorsoventral neural axis in the rat MG and TRN (Bordi &
LeDoux, 1994; Kimura et al., 2005, 2009, 2012a). In the results,
the features of burst spiking did not change along the dorsoventral

neural axis, however. Rather, the variations of burst spiking were
observed along the rostrocaudal neural axis and marked in the TRNMGD cell group that is supposed to receive thalamic inputs primarily from the MGD where tonotopy is obscure. Thus, tonotopy-based
differential cell activation is unlikely to contribute to the present
results. Taken together, the features of burst spiking associated with
afferent (cell body) and efferent (terminal ﬁeld) connections of the
TRN are thought to reﬂect anatomically structured functional properties of the TRN.
The present study conﬁrms the previous ﬁnding that TRN cells
send axonal projections to the MGV topographic along the rostrocaudal, dorsoventral and mediolateral neural axes (Kimura et al.,
2007) and for the ﬁrst time indicates the topography of projections
to the MGD along the rostrocaudal neural axis. The features of burst
spiking correlated with the rostrocaudal locations of cell bodies in
both the TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cell groups and thereby correlated with the rostrocaudal locations of terminal ﬁelds in the MGV
and MGD. These ﬁndings raise the possibility that afferent and
efferent connections of the TRN are organized in a way that allows
the TRN to impose graded impacts of burst spiking on thalamic
information processing along the rostrocaudal neural axis. The
MGV of the rat has response properties and anatomical connectivities regionally differentiated along the rostrocaudal neural axis
(Kimura et al., 2003, 2005, 2012a; Donishi et al., 2011). The correlation between intra-burst ISIs in auditory response and the locations

of cell bodies and terminal ﬁelds in the TRN-MGV cell group,
although fairly weak, may contribute to the rostrocaudal gradient of
response properties of MGV cells, as with the rostrocaudally graded
density of GABA cells in the MGV of the cat (Rodrigues-Dagaeff
et al., 1989; Rouiller et al., 1990). The correlation in the TRNMGD cell group, which, although limited to the numbers of spikes
composing a burst, was consistently observed in auditory response
and spontaneous activity, appears strong as compared with the correlation in the TRN-MGV cell group. Of note is that there seems to
be an interesting anatomical coincidence between this ﬁnding and a
recent report that has documented regional differences in the intensity of stimulus-speciﬁc adaptation (SSA) in the MGV and MGD
(Antunes et al., 2010). TRN-MGV and TRN-MGD cells with the
distinct features of burst spiking and recurrent activation (non-primary response) may provide differential inﬂuences on auditory
change detection of MGV and MGD cells (Yu et al., 2009), which
could be represented as distinct intensities of SSA observed in the
MGV and MGD (Antunes et al., 2010). Lower intensities of SSA
are observed in the whole MGV and the rostral MGD where TRN
cells with higher levels of burst spiking send axonal projections,
while higher intensities of SSA are observed in the caudal MGD
where TRN cells with lower levels of burst spiking send axonal projections. It could be possible to assume that the strong correlation in
the TRN-MGD cell group may provide graded inﬂuences on thalamic cell activity resulting in the rostrocaudal gradient of SSA
intensity inside the MGD while the weak correlation in the TRNMGV cell group may fail to provide differential inﬂuences resulting
in the absence of a regional gradient inside the MGV (Antunes
et al., 2010).

In both auditory and visual modalities, the features of burst spiking in spontaneous activity correlate with the rostrocaudal locations
of cell bodies, and the rostral and caudal domains of the TRN are
allocated to the two types of TRN cells projecting to ﬁrst- and
higher-order thalamic nuclei (Kimura et al., 2012b). As such, auditory and visual systems seem to adopt a common structural arrangement of burst spiking for the TRN to serve distinct modulations of
lemniscal and non-lemniscal sensory processing. There may be an
anatomically structured functional matrix other than those for tonotopy- and retinotopy-based processing (Kimura et al., 2005, 2007,
2009, 2012a; Fitzgibbon et al., 2007; Cotillon-Williams et al.,
2008). Questions then arise. Does the rostrocaudal gradient of burst
spiking features extend to the further rostral TRN that contains
somatosensory cells (Shosaku & Sumitomo, 1983)? Do somatosensory cells projecting to ﬁrst- and higher-order thalamic nuclei have
distinct cell activities and distributions in the TRN? Further studies
addressing these questions are needed to clarify how the sensory
sectors of the TRN are organized as a whole to modulate sensory
processing in lemniscal and non-lemniscal thalamocortical loop connections that converge on the TRN (Pinault, 2004; Kimura et al.,
2012a).
Functional implications
The TRN is known to decisively modulate thalamic cell activity
(French et al., 1985; Halassa et al., 2011). MGV and MGD cells
have similar intrinsic properties in slice preparations (Bartlett &
Smith, 1999). Therefore, TRN cells with distinct features of burst
spiking are thought to mold MGV and MGD cell activities into different types. TRN cells with higher levels of burst spiking are
assumed to impose stronger inhibition on thalamic cells (Kim et al.,
1997), which would condition MGV cells to more frequently discharge in burst than MGD cells. This assumption, however, contradicts low and high levels of burst spiking observed in MGV and
MGD cell activities (primary response) directly driven by sound
stimulation (He & Hu, 2002). In primary response, cortical (Wolfart
et al., 2005) and/or neuromodulator inputs (Varela & Sherman,
2007, 2009) rather than TRN inputs may have signiﬁcant inﬂuences
for conditioning MGV and MGD cells to show distinct activities in
response to tectal excitatory and/or inhibitory inputs (Bartlett &
Smith, 1999). On the other hand, the TRN may provide a signiﬁcant
impact for molding discharge patterns in non-primary response. A
notable ﬁnding is that MGV cells have a clear tendency to show
single spikes in primary response and bursts in repeatedly evoked
non-primary responses (Kimura et al., 2009). TRN-MGV cells with
higher levels of burst spiking could provide potent inhibition, which
would effectively condition MGV cells to discharge in burst in nonprimary response.
Sound stimulation sustainably attenuated the intensities of burst
spiking of TRN-MGV cells in terms of the number and density of
spikes in a burst, whereas it transiently attenuated those of TRNMGD cells. Sustained and transient alterations of burst spiking are
also observed in TRN visual cells projecting to the DLG and LP
following light stimulation (Kimura et al., 2012b). Interestingly, the
alterations of burst spiking in visual cells are enhancement. The difference in the direction of alteration may be related to possible distinctions in the properties of thalamocortical loop circuitries inherent
to auditory and visual modalities, such as the distinct distributions
of Typical- and Atypical-burst types of cells in the visual and auditory domains of the TRN (Lee et al., 2007) and the distinct densities of inhibitory interneurons in visual and auditory thalamic nuclei
(Winer & Larue, 1996). Alternatively, the differential impacts of

light and sound stimuli used for cell activation could be a cause of
the difference. Apart from the difference in the direction of alteration, the sustained alteration could allow TRN auditory and visual
cells projecting to ﬁrst-order thalamic nuclei to incorporate the
impacts of sensory inputs into recurrent activation of thalamocortical
loop circuitry for temporally integrated sensory processing. On the
other hand, TRN auditory and visual cells projecting to higher-order
thalamic nuclei are less likely to incorporate the impacts of sensory
inputs into recurrent activation, but the transient alteration of burst
spiking could highlight the moment of sensory activation for attentive sensory processing. Together with these distinctions, the synergy between thalamic and TRN cell activities with their contrasting
features of burst spiking may compose distinct information processing and attentional gating functions of the lemniscal and non-lemniscal sensory systems.

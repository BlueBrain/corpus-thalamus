This is the concluding article in a series of 3 studies that
investigate the anatomical determinants of thalamocortical (TC)
input to excitatory neurons in a cortical column of rat primary
somatosensory cortex (S1). We used viral synaptophysinenhanced green fluorescent protein expression in thalamic
neurons and reconstructions of biocytin-labeled cortical neurons
in TC slices to quantify the number and distribution of boutons
from the ventral posterior medial (VPM) and posteromedial
(POm) nuclei potentially innervating dendritic arbors of excitatory neurons located in layers (L)2--6 of a cortical column in rat
somatosensory cortex. We found that 1) all types of excitatory
neurons potentially receive substantial TC input (90--580 boutons
per neuron); 2) pyramidal neurons in L3--L6 receive dual TC input
from both VPM and POm that is potentially of equal magnitude
for thick-tufted L5 pyramidal neurons (ca. 300 boutons each from
VPM and POm); 3) L3, L4, and L5 pyramidal neurons have
multiple (2--4) subcellular TC innervation domains that match the
dendritic compartments of pyramidal cells; and 4) a subtype of
thick-tufted L5 pyramidal neurons has an additional VPM
innervation domain in L4. The multiple subcellular TC innervation
domains of L5 pyramidal neurons may partly explain their
specific action potential patterns observed in vivo. We conclude
that the substantial potential TC innervation of all excitatory
neuron types in a cortical column constitutes an anatomical
basis for the initial near-simultaneous representation of a sensory
stimulus in different neuron types.

Introduction
The primary somatosensory (barrel) cortex is effectively driven
by weak but near-synchronous thalamocortical (TC) input to
the granular layer 4 (Bruno and Sakmann 2006). Anatomically,
the TC input to layer 4 (L4) was ﬁrst described as ‘‘speciﬁc’’ TC
afferents arising from thalamic relay nuclei, which ascend
undivided through L5 and L6 and form a dense plexus of axons
in cytoarchitectonic granular L4 and a less dense plexus in L3
(Lorente de No 1922, 1938, 1992; see also Jones and Powell
1970; Killackey 1973). ‘‘Unspeciﬁc’’ TC afferents were found to

be sparsely distributed in all cortical layers and to arborize
predominantly in L1 and L6 (Lorente de No´ 1938). This
observation has been taken as evidence for the view that TC
excitation of the cortex is effected mainly, if not exclusively, by
the initial excitation of L4 neurons. In this view of a ‘‘hierarchical processing scheme,’’ as it was ﬁrst proposed for the visual
cortex by Hubel and Wiesel (1962, 1968), sensory excitation
then spreads from L4 to supra- and infragranular layers (Simons
1978, 1985; Armstrong-James et al. 1992; Binzegger et al. 2004;
Douglas and Martin 2004).
However, dendrites of excitatory neurons from supra- and
infragranular layers are also contacted by TC synapses within
L4 (White 1978; Peters 1979). It was concluded that TC
synapses were determined mainly by the overlap of TC axons
with the dendrites of cortical cells and that TC axons make
synapses with virtually all neurons that have their somata in
L2--L6 (Peters 1979; White 1979). This prediction was further
supported by the report of signiﬁcant TC projections from both
the ventroposterior and the posterior thalamic nuclei to supraand infragranular layers (Wise and Jones 1978; Herkenham
1980; Chmielowska et al. 1989; Lu and Lin 1993).
As functional evidence of whole-column TC excitation,
whole-cell, juxtasomal, and extracellular recordings from
different cell types indicated that the minimal latency of
excitatory postsynaptic potentials and action potential (AP)
spiking, evoked by a whisker deﬂection, is comparable within
only a few milliseconds in virtually all layers (Ahissar et al. 2000;
Brecht and Sakmann 2002; Brecht et al. 2003; Manns et al. 2004;
de Kock et al. 2007). These observations argue for an initial
near-simultaneous representation of a tactile stimulus in
multiple cortical layers rather than for a sequential representation radiating from the granular layer.
In the sequence of studies reported in this and the 2 preceding
articles, we aimed at quantifying the anatomical determinants
for near-simultaneous TC activation in the somatosensory
cortex. First, we measured the distribution of TC boutons
originating in the ventral posterior medial (VPM) nucleus and
the medial part of the posterior group nuclei (posteromedial,
POm) of the thalamus (Wimmer et al. 2010) using virusmediated expression of ﬂuorescent proteins in thalamic boutons
(Wimmer et al. 2004, 2010). Next, we measured the distribution

Materials and Methods
We 1) measured the proﬁle of VPM and POm thalamic bouton densities
along the longitudinal column axis in somatosensory cortex (using virusmediated expression of ﬂuorescent proteins in TC boutons as reported
in the ﬁrst article of this series of reports; Wimmer et al. 2010), 2)
measured the distribution of neuronal somata stained for the neuronspeciﬁc nuclear protein ‘‘Neuronal Nuclei’’ (NeuN; Mullen et al. 1992) in
separate experiments (as reported in the second article of this series of
reports; Meyer et al. 2010), 3) measured the dendritic density distributions along the longitudinal column axis of neurons that were reconstructed after in vitro single-cell recordings in separate experiments (n =
82), 4) aligned the bouton and dendritic density proﬁles using the pia
and the white matter (WM) as landmarks in cortex, 5) divided the
bouton proﬁles by a proﬁle representing the distribution of total
dendritic length in a cortical column to obtain a proﬁle of normalized TC
bouton density per unit dendrite length in a cortical column, and 6)
multiplied the aligned TC bouton density proﬁle with dendritic proﬁles
to obtain the distributions of thalamic contacts on individual neurons of
different types.

Measurement of Thalamic Bouton Densities
Experiments were conducted in accordance with the German Animal
Welfare Act. The methods used for virus delivery and the histological
procedures were the same as described before (Wimmer et al. 2004,
2010). Brieﬂy, P28 Wistar rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal
injection of 5 lg/kg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg midazolam, and 150 lg/kg
medetomidine. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) - synaptophysin enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (EGFP) (100--200 nL; 33106
infectious particles/mL) was stereotaxically injected bilaterally into
VPM or POm using calibrated injection capillaries. The injection

coordinates were as follows (in mm): 2.85 posterior of bregma, 3.2
lateral of the midline, and 5.05 deep from the pia for VPM and 3.25
posterior, 2.1 lateral, and 5.2 deep for POm. After virus delivery (12--14
days), rats were euthanized with a lethal dose of urethane and
transcardially perfused with 15 mL phosphate buffer (PB) followed by
15 mL PB with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brain was extracted
and incubated overnight in PB containing 4% PFA at 4°C. TC vibratome
sections (45° from midline) at 70--100 lm thickness were prepared
(Bernardo and Woolsey 1987; Agmon and Connors 1991; Fleidervish
et al. 1998).
In order to align the virus-labeled bouton proﬁles with the data on
soma distributions and dendritic labelings from different experiments,
we deﬁned landmarks in each of the experiments (the details of
alignment are described in a separate section, see below). To calibrate
the L4-to-L5A border along the longitudinal column axis (as a control
landmark) in the virus-labeled slices, these slices were subsequently
immunolabeled against NeuN using a monoclonal antibody at 1:1000
(for a detailed protocol, see Meyer et al. 2010).
Then, slices were imaged using confocal mosaic scanning with TCS
SP2 (Leica Microsystems) or FV1000 (Olympus) laser scanning microscopes. Either a 363 Leica (HCX PL APO CS; numerical aperture [NA]:
1.32, oil immersion) or a 340 Olympus (UPLFLN; NA: 1.3, oil immersion)
objective was used. Each mosaic tile measured 180--225 lm in x and y.
To obtain the average thalamic bouton ﬂuorescence intensity along the
longitudinal axis of a cortical column (‘‘z-axis’’), ﬂuorescence intensity
histograms (bin size: 0.4 lm) were calculated from maximum intensity
projections of confocal image stacks using ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/; ‘‘bouton z-proﬁles’’). To correct for potential background
ﬂuorescence, a linear offset gradient based on the mean of the ﬁrst 50
(POm) or 100 (VPM) and the last 100 bins was subtracted from the
histograms. Finally, histograms were scaled to the standard TC
projection column height (Wimmer et al. 2010) of 1840 lm, yielding
an effective bin size of 46 lm.

Labeling of Single Excitatory Neurons and Calculation of
Dendritic Length Density Proﬁles
In separate experiments, TC slices of adolescent (mean age:
P28.5 ± 2 days, range: 26--42) Wistar rat barrel cortex were cut at
300--350 lm thickness as described previously (Feldmeyer et al.
1999). Using a 32.5 Olympus objective (Plan Neoﬂuar; NA: 0.075)
and brightﬁeld illumination, barrel-related columns in the region of
the posteromedial barrel subﬁeld were identiﬁed as bright spots in
L4 outlined by dark bands. Neurons were visualized using a 340 Zeiss
objective (Plan Apochromat; NA: 0.8, water immersion) and infrared
differential interference contrast (IR-DIC; Dodt and Zieglga¨nsberger
1990; Stuart et al. 1993)-or infrared gradient contrast (IR-GC; Dodt
et al. 1998, 1999)-videomicroscopy. Whole-cell recordings of putative excitatory neurons in barrel columns were made for 10--30 min
to ﬁll neurons with biocytin (Sigma). The intracellular solution
consisted of (in mM) 135 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), 10 phosphocreatine-Na2, 4
KCl, 4 ATP-Mg, and 0.3 GTP (adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH) and
contained 0.3--0.6% biocytin. Slices were ﬁxed in 4% PFA for 24 h,
labeled using the diaminobenzidine (DAB)--horseradish peroxidase
protocol (Horikawa and Armstrong 1988), and embedded in Mowiol
(Kuraray Specialities Europe GmbH). Dendritic reconstructions of
labeled neurons were made (n = 82) with a Neurolucida system
(Microbrightﬁeld) equipped with a 3100 (NA: 1.25, oil immersion)
objective. Slice edges were also traced to approximate the contours
of the pia.
All reconstructions were rotated so that the pial surface above the
soma was oriented horizontally. For alignment, reconstructions were
scaled uniformly so that the distance between pial surface and the
border between cortex and the WM was 2000 lm using the custommade software NeuronRegistrator 1D (written in Matlab, The MathWorks). Three-dimensional dendritic length density maps at a bin size
of (50 lm)3 were computed from the scaled reconstructions using the
custom-made software Rembrandt 3D (written in Matlab). These 3D
maps were projected onto the slice plane (‘‘x--z plane’’) by summing all
bins sharing equal x and z coordinates. The resulting 2D map was

of neuronal cell bodies in a cortical column deﬁned by the
thalamic projections (Meyer et al. 2010). In the present study,
we measured the dendrite distributions of 7 types of cortical
excitatory neurons in L2--L6 of a cortical column by in vitro
whole-cell ﬁlling of 82 cortical excitatory neurons. Together
with the data on the prevalence of each of these neuron types
from the preceding study, this yielded the distribution of
putative postsynaptic dendrites of excitatory neurons in
a cortical column. Finally, we computed the anatomical overlap
between the TC bouton proﬁles and the distribution of
putatively postsynaptic dendrites. The calculation is based on
the simplifying assumption that the actual synaptic connectivity
is proportional to the potential connectivity quantiﬁed as the
product of bouton density and dendritic density (i.e., the
connectivity is locally random; this notion was ﬁrst proposed
by Peters [1979] and later extended by White [1979, 1989]; for
a more recent discussion, see Shepherd et al. [2005]; Stepanyants
and Chklovskii [2005]). The resulting estimates of the amount
of potential TC innervation of cortical neurons provided
quantitative constraints on TC innervation domains.
We found that all excitatory neuron types in a cortical
column of somatosensory cortex are potentially innervated by at
least 90 TC boutons. This can be regarded as the anatomical
basis for the initial near-simultaneous representation of a sensory
stimulus measured in different neuron types in vivo. In addition,
we found that excitatory neurons in L3, L5, and L6 have multiple
subcellular TC innervation domains. A subtype of L5 thick-tufted
pyramidal neurons had an additional TC innervation domain
in L4. Strikingly, L5 thick-tufted pyramidal neurons are
potentially innervated by both VPM and POm with comparable
numbers of potential contacts per neuron, which may constitute the anatomical basis of their speciﬁc AP discharge patterns
upon whisker stimulation as observed in vivo.

projected onto the longitudinal column axis (z-axis; perpendicular to
the pial surface) by summing all bins at the same depth from the pial
surface, yielding a histogram of dendritic length density along the
longitudinal axis of a cortical column (‘‘dendritic z-proﬁle’’). All
dendritic z-proﬁles were scaled uniformly to the standard projection
column height (1840 lm, yielding a bin size of 46 lm).
TC bouton z-proﬁles and dendritic z-proﬁles were visualized as line
plots and grayscale color plots after linear interpolation and smoothing
with a sliding mean ﬁlter using the custom-made software ‘‘Rothko’’
(available at http://www.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de/~mhelmsta/tools/)
written in Matlab.

Estimation of the Distribution of Dendritic Length of All
Excitatory Neurons in a Cortical Column
In the preceding article, we found a total number of approximately
19 000 neurons (19 109 ± 444, n = 3) in a cortical column as deﬁned by
the TC axonal projections (Meyer et al. 2010). To correct for
nonexcitatory neurons, we assumed a (GABAergic) interneuron ratio

Deﬁnition of ‘‘Excitatory’’ Neurons
Neurons were selected for whole-cell recording if the soma had
a pyramidal shape when visualized under the IR-DIC or IR-GC optics
during the experiment (layers 2/3, 5, and 6); they were selected for
recording if the soma had a spheroid shape in L4. The type of the
recorded neuron was, however, deﬁnitively determined only after
staining and reconstruction (as described above). Neurons in the supraand infragranular layers were included in the sample if they had the
morphological features of pyramidal neurons. In the granular layer 4, all
spiny neurons were included in the sample. Thus, the sample of
82 neurons analyzed here can be summarized for all layers as ‘‘spiny
neurons’’ anatomically. However, since there is ample evidence that the
neurons we recorded from are glutamatergic (Markram et al. 1997;
Feldmeyer et al. 1999, 2002, 2005, 2006; Mercer et al. 2005; West et al.
2006; Krieger et al. 2007; Helmstaedter, Staiger, et al. 2008), we refer to
these neurons as ‘‘excitatory’’ throughout the text.
The somatic staining for NeuN as reported in the preceding article
(Meyer et al. 2010) is assumed to label all neurons. We have corrected
the total number of neurons for the approximate fraction of GABAergic
neurons (15%; Beaulieu 1993; see above; cf. the Discussion for
a quantiﬁcation of the effect of this simpliﬁcation). We therefore use
the term ‘‘excitatory neuron’’ also for the NeuN-positive soma density
when corrected for the expected ratio of GABAergic interneurons.
Conversion of Bouton Fluorescence z-Proﬁles to Absolute
Bouton Density z-Proﬁles
The VPM bouton ﬂuorescence density z-proﬁle can be converted to a zproﬁle of absolute VPM bouton densities by scaling the integral of the
proﬁle to the total number of VPM boutons per column. We assumed
a total number of 250 VPM neurons projecting to a cortical column
(range: 200--300; Land et al. 1995; Varga et al. 2002). For a single VPM
neuron, the mean total axonal path length was taken to be
approximately 60 3 103 lm (Oberlaender, Bruno, and Sakmann,
unpublished observations), of which approximately 35 3 103 lm was
estimated to be within the home column (Oberlaender, Bruno, and
Sakmann, unpublished observations). Bouton density was assumed to
be 0.33 ± 0.02/lm axon length (Oberlaender, Bruno, and Sakmann,
unpublished observations). Together, this yields an estimated total of
2.9 3 106 VPM boutons in the home column (250 3 35 3 103 3 0.33,
range: 2.3--3.5 3 106 given 200--300 VPM neurons). Normalizing the
integral of the proﬁle (Fig. 1A) to the total estimated number of VPM
boutons then yields a peak density of 4.04 3 107/mm3 (range: 3.22-4.83 3 107/mm3) in a cortical column. Due to the lack of anatomical
data on POm innervation of a cortical column, we did not estimate the
total number of POm boutons projecting to a cortical column. Instead,
we measured the difference between VPM bouton density in L4 and
POm bouton density in L5A, that is, the difference between the
respective peak bouton densities. Boutons marked by synaptophysinEGFP (see above) were visually identiﬁed in confocal image stacks. We
counted 2861 (VPM) and 1959 (POm) boutons in 6 (VPM) and 4 (POm)
volumes sized 11 3 103 lm3 each. VPM peak density (4.4 ± 0.6 3 107/
mm3) matched the peak density based on anatomical assumptions

Comparison of Cytoarchitectonic Landmarks in Virus-Labeled
Slices and Whole-Cell Recording Experiments
For alignment of bouton z-proﬁles and dendritic z-proﬁles from
separate experiments, 3 landmarks in cortex were used: 1) the pial
surface, 2) the border between L4 and L5A, and 3) the border between
L6 and the subcortical WM. The pia and L6--WM border were identiﬁed
by visual inspection in both virus-labeled slices and DAB-stained slices
from whole-cell recording experiments. The pial surface was clearly
identiﬁable as the border between pial blood vessels and cortical tissue.
In DAB-stained slices, pia outlines were traced both at the ‘‘upper’’ and
at the ‘‘lower’’ z-edges of the tissue and the average outline was used to
correct for the curvature of the cortex. The L6--WM border was deﬁned
on maximum intensity projection images of confocal NeuN ﬂuorescence image stacks for virus-labeled slices (see above). Other than L6,
the WM contained none or only very few neurons (cf. Supplementary
Fig. 1B). In DAB-stained slices, the L6--WM border was deﬁned as the
transition to a dark horizontal band representing high density of
myelinated axons in the WM (cf. Supplementary Fig. 1A).
For virus-labeled slices, the border between L4 and L5A was deﬁned in
the NeuN epiﬂuorescence images as the sharp transition from a layer of
small neuron somata at high density representing L4 to a layer of larger
neuron somata at low density representing L5A (cf. Supplementary
Fig. 1B, see below). In DAB-stained slices from whole-cell recording
experiments, the border between L4 and L5A was identiﬁed as the
transition from the dark horizontal band representing L4 to a less stained
region marking the beginning of L5A (cf. Supplementary Fig. 1A).
To compare measurements made in virus-labeled slices with those
made in slices from whole-cell recording experiments, we conﬁrmed
the correspondence of the L4-to-L5A border derived from DAB staining
to the L4-to-L5A border derived from the NeuN-positive soma density
(Supplementary Fig. 1, n = 4). First, a TC slice was cut at 300 lm
thickness and selected for whole-cell recording. Then, the subsequent
slice was cut at 200 lm thickness and immediately ﬁxed in 4% PFA.
Then, the 200-lm slice was immunolabeled for NeuN, and a maximum
intensity projection of confocal NeuN ﬂuorescence image stacks was
acquired from the upper 15 lm of the slice (measured perpendicular to
the slice plane, see Supplementary Fig. 1B). The L4--L5A border was
then visually identiﬁed on the maximum intensity projection image as
described above for virus-labeled slices. The 300-lm slice was stained
using the biocytin--horseradish peroxidase--DAB protocol as described
above. Then, we compared the L4--L5A border identiﬁed in the DABstained slice with that identiﬁed in the NeuN-labeled slice (Supplementary Fig. 1A). The ratio of the L4--L5A border depth to the cortical
thickness above the hippocampal pole with the pia rotated horizontally
was measured in both slices. The mean difference of the ratio was 0.64
± 0.37%. We concluded that the measurement of the L4--L5A border by
visual inspection of NeuN-labeled slices is consistent with that by visual
inspection of DAB-stained slices and that we could, as a basic
prerequisite for alignment of dendritic z-proﬁles with bouton z-proﬁles,
compare cytoarchitectonic landmark measurements from whole-cell
recording experiments with measurements from virus-labeled slices.

of 15% (Beaulieu 1993), yielding approximately 16 150 excitatory
neurons per cortical column (for a comparison of this simpliﬁed
assumption to other error sources, see Discussion; for a clariﬁcation of
the nomenclature ‘‘excitatory neuron’’ and ‘‘interneuron’’, see below).
We calculated the distribution of the dendritic path length of
excitatory neurons in a cortical column from single-cell dendritic
morphologies and whole-column neuron densities. The 82 neurons in
our sample were grouped according to their soma depth from the pial
surface (cf. Fig. 5; range of soma depth in a standard column: 124--1617
lm, yielding 17 groups; average group size: 5 neurons, effective bin size:
92 lm). Then, average dendritic z-proﬁles for each group were calculated
by averaging the single-cell dendritic z-proﬁles within a group. Next, the
average dendritic proﬁles were convolved with the neuron density
proﬁle obtained from whole-column counts of NeuN-positive somata
as reported in the preceding article (Meyer et al. 2010). This yielded
a z-proﬁle of the distribution of the total dendritic length of excitatory
neurons along the longitudinal axis of a cortical column (Fig. 4A).

For estimating the contribution of septal neurons to the total dendritic
path length in cortex, we took the volume of the septum related to
a particular column as approximately 0.13 mm3 (Table 2 in Meyer et al.
2010, i.e., 0.13/0.24 = 55% of the column volume) with a septal neuron
density of 68.6 3 103/mm3 (Table 1 in Meyer et al. 2010, i.e., 68.6/78.9 =
87% of the density inside a column); together, this means that including
septal neurons adds approximately 48% to the intracolumnar dendritic
length. TC input from other than the somatotopically aligned barreloid
increases the TC axonal path length by approximately 67%; together, this
yields a 1.67/1.48 = 13% increase under these assumptions. If septal
neurons receive less or no direct VPM input, these numbers can
substantially change; we therefore estimate a 10--30% increase in the
numbers on TC boutons if these effects are included.

(4.04 3 107/mm3). Since the infection rate of thalamic neurons upon
virus injection was estimated to be only 85% (Wimmer et al. 2010), this
indicates that our estimate of VPM boutons per home column based on
anatomical assumptions may be slightly too low, possibly because it
does not account for VPM projections from other than the somatotopically aligned barreloid.
We used the direct bouton density measurements only to compare
POm and VPM peak bouton densities. POm peak bouton density
(4.7 ± 0.6 3 107/mm3) was not signiﬁcantly different from VPM
(P = 0.54, paired t-test, 2 tailed). We thus scaled the POm bouton
ﬂuorescence density proﬁle so that the peak density was equal to that
of the VPM bouton density proﬁle, obtaining a proﬁle of absolute POm
bouton densities, and a total number of 1.8 3 106 POm boutons
projecting to a cortical column. For further calculations, the numbers
of VPM and POm boutons were reduced by 15% to account for boutons
contacting interneurons based on the ratio of interneurons in a cortical
column (see above).

Results
VPM and POm Bouton Proﬁles
Figure 1 shows dorsomedial portions of barrel cortex in the
section plane of the TC slice after injection of VPM or POm with
AAV expressing EGFP-coupled synaptophysin. Figure 1A (left
panel) shows the staining of boutons of axons originating in the
VPM. Figure 1B (left panel) shows another TC section with
staining of boutons of axons originating in the POm. Both
sections illustrate the differential vertical density distributions
of VPM and POm boutons as quantiﬁed in the bouton
ﬂuorescence intensity histograms (‘‘bouton z-proﬁles’’, right
panels of Fig. 1A,B). Each proﬁle represents the respective
thalamic bouton ﬂuorescence intensity as a function of the
distance from the pial surface along the longitudinal column
axis (for calculation of bouton z-proﬁles, see Materials and
Methods). VPM and POm bouton density peaks were well
separated, with a local overlap at 780--830 lm depth below the
pia if scaled to a standard column height of 1840 lm (cf. Fig.
1A,B). The bouton ﬂuorescence z-proﬁles were then converted
to absolute bouton density z-proﬁles. Manual bouton counts
yielded peak TC bouton densities of 4.4 ± 0.6 3 107/mm3 and
4.7 ± 0.6 3 107/mm3 for VPM and POm, respectively. These
densities matched the anatomical estimate of VPM innervation
based on assumptions of the number of thalamic neurons in
VPM, the axonal path length of VPM projections, and the bouton
density on VPM axons (4.04 3 107/mm3 peak density and a total
of 2.9 3 106 boutons in a cortical column). The total number of

histogram along the vertical (pia to white matter) column axis (‘‘bouton z-profile’’)
obtained from the image shown on the left panel. The profile was interpolated and
smoothed for visualization. (B) Image showing thalamic boutons from the POm
nucleus in a cortical column. The same cortical region as in (A) was selected for
confocal scanning. Shown is a 220-lm-wide strip of the column center (the cortical
thickness was scaled to 1840 lm). Right panel: POm bouton z-profile obtained from
the image shown on the left panel. The profile was interpolated and smoothed for
visualization. Bouton densities were calibrated by manual counting of boutons in
confocal image stacks. VPM and POm peak bouton densities were found to be equal.
Assuming a total of 2.9 3 106 VPM boutons per column (see Materials and
Methods), the underlying fluorescence intensities can be converted to bouton
densities, yielding a peak density of 4.04 3 107 boutons/mm3 for both POm and VPM
and 1.8 3 106 total POm boutons per column.

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses in this study, such as Student’s t-tests, one-way
analyses of variance (ANOVAs), and multiple comparison tests (Scheffe´
procedure), were performed with the statistical toolbox of Matlab.
The cluster analysis for identifying the subtype of L5B pyramidal
neurons with an additional VPM innervation domain in L4 was made in
the following 2D parameter space: 1) the number of oblique dendrites
within 300 lm above the L4-to-L5A border and 2) the total dendritic
path length within 506--782 lm depth from the pia (corresponding to
bins 11--17). The cluster analysis was made as described previously
(Cauli et al. 2000; Helmstaedter et al. 2009): Euclidean distances, Ward’s
method (Ward 1963), and Thorndike procedure (Thorndike 1953) for
linkage distance cutoff (see Fig. 7B, lower panel), rejecting 1-item
clusters (all in Matlab).
The statistical test for the predicted number of VPM boutons has to
be interpreted cautiously; because the innervation in L4 is highly
correlated with the total dendritic density in L4, and because the latter
parameter was used for separating the clusters, nonparametric tests are
expected to report arbitrary levels of signiﬁcance. We used a parametric
test (here: one-sided t-test assuming normally distributed data with
unequal variances) that can be interpreted as an indication of the
amount of separation between the clusters.

POm boutons in a cortical column was estimated to be 1.8 3 106
(for details of the calculations, see Materials and Methods).

Distribution of the Dendrites of Excitatory Neurons in
a Cortical Column
To quantify the overlap of TC bouton density distributions with
dendritic length density distributions of excitatory neurons in
a barrel-related column, we labeled neurons in acute brain
slices of barrel cortex during whole-cell recording. Their soma
and dendritic arbors were reconstructed. Figure 2 shows one
reconstruction of an L5 thick-tufted neuron superimposed on
a brightﬁeld image of the acute slice (a brightﬁeld image of the
same slice after DAB staining is shown in Supplementary
Fig. 1A; for a quantiﬁcation of dendritic length ratio outside the
home column, see Supplementary Fig. 2). Dendritic length
density histograms (‘‘dendritic z-proﬁles’’) were calculated from
the reconstructions, representing the dendritic length as
a function of the distance to the pial surface along the
longitudinal column axis (right panel in Fig. 2; for details, see
Materials and Methods). Both the thalamic bouton z-proﬁles and
the reconstructed neurons were obtained from barrel columns
located above the lateral ventricle/hippocampal fornix region,
where the large barrels of macrovibrissae are located.
To conﬁrm that the cytoarchitecture of the barrel columns
analyzed for thalamic bouton distributions (Fig. 1) was similar to
that of the barrel columns containing biocytin-ﬁlled neurons
(Fig. 2), we compared cytoarchitectonic registration landmarks
(for details of the comparability of landmarks obtained from
DAB-stained slices with landmarks found in virus-labeled slices,
see Materials and Methods; Supplementary Fig. 1). The cortical
thickness (distance from pia to L6--WM border) was 1860 lm in
the VPM bouton-labeled slice (Fig. 1A), 2050 lm in the POm
bouton-labeled slice (Fig. 1B), and 1994 ± 105 lm (n = 82) in the
slices containing DAB-stained biocytin-ﬁlled neurons. All measurements were then scaled uniformly to a standard projection
column height of 1840 lm (the dimensions of the ‘‘standard’’
projection column were reported in the ﬁrst article of this
series; Wimmer et al. 2010). The ratio of the L4--L5A border to
the total cortical thickness was comparable (43.8% and 44.1%
in the virus-labeled slices vs. 43.7 ± 2.4% in DAB-stained slices).
We concluded that bouton z-proﬁles based on the virus-labeled
slices and dendritic z-proﬁles based on the DAB-stained slices
could be superimposed after registration along the z-axis.

shape and soma-to-pia distance (Fig. 3; for a depiction of all
dendritic reconstructions, cf. Supplementary Fig. 3). L2
pyramidal neurons mostly had a broad apical tuft with an early

Note: The predicted number of boutons calculated for each neuron as the integral of the VPM or POm innervation density profile (see inset in Fig. 5B). The number of spines per neuron was calculated
assuming a spine density of 0.5/lm dendritic path length. Mean distance of VPM and POm boutons: total dendritic length per neuron divided by the number of boutons per neuron. All values reported as
mean ± standard deviation. Note that the predicted absolute number of thalamocortical boutons per neuron is based on the axonal path length of VPM neurons extended in the somatotopically aligned
home column, only, and thus represents a lower bound estimate. All values have an additional estimated uncertainty of ±30% due to the uncertainty in assumptions on the total number of
thalamocortical boutons in a column, see Materials and Methods and Discussion for details.

Meyer et al.

Quantiﬁcation of TC Innervation of Individual Neurons
In order to compute the probability of TC innervation for the
different types of cortical neurons, TC bouton z-proﬁles
(normalized to represent the absolute number of thalamic
contacts; see Fig. 1 and Materials and Methods) were multiplied
with dendritic z-proﬁles (Fig. 2). As a simpliﬁcation, at a given
cortical depth, the number of thalamic boutons was taken to
be uniformly ‘‘distributed’’ between all dendrites (Peters 1979;
White 1979, 1989; Shepherd et al. 2005; Stepanyants and
Chklovskii 2005). An individual dendrite will then receive the
fraction of the boutons that corresponds to the ratio of its
length to the total dendritic length present at that location.
We therefore estimated the total dendritic length distribution of excitatory neurons in a cortical column. The average
dendritic z-proﬁles of excitatory neurons at a given soma depth
were convolved with a neuron density z-proﬁle that
represented the number of excitatory neurons at that depth
within an average TC projection column as deﬁned in the 2
preceding articles (Meyer et al. 2010; Wimmer et al. 2010).
This yielded a z-proﬁle of the total dendritic path length of
excitatory neurons at a given depth in a cortical column
(‘‘total dendritic z-proﬁle’’; Fig. 4A; for details, see Materials
and Methods). The total dendritic length density was highest
in the upper 150 lm of the cortex, with a peak density of
812 m/mm3 at 70 lm depth, corresponding to the apical tufts
of all pyramidal neurons in a cortical column. The total
dendritic length of all excitatory neurons in a cortical column
was 75 m.
We then divided the VPM and POm bouton z-proﬁles (Fig. 1)
by the total dendritic z-proﬁle (Fig. 4A). The resulting z-proﬁles
show the depth dependence of VPM (red line in Fig. 4B) and
POm (green line in Fig. 4B) bouton density per unit dendritic
path length in a cortical column (‘‘normalized’’ VPM and POm

Figure 4. Total dendritic length distribution and normalized thalamocortical
innervation density in a cortical column. (A) Dendritic z-profile of all excitatory
neurons in a cortical column. All excitatory neurons were grouped based on soma
depth from the pial surface. Average dendritic z-profiles were calculated for all
groups. Each profile was then multiplied with the total number of excitatory neurons
in a cortical column within the respective bin and the multiplied profiles were
summated (i.e., the average dendritic z-profiles were convolved with a soma density
profile). This yielded a profile representing the total excitatory neuron dendritic length
at a given depth, which was finally normalized to the total cortical column volume to
obtain an estimate of the dendritic path length per volume density (m/mm3).

Methods). (B) Normalized VPM (red line) and normalized POm (green line) bouton

bouton density proﬁles). Normalized VPM bouton density was
highest between 400 and 800 lm depth from the pia
(maximum: 0.10 boutons/lm dendrite). Normalized POm
bouton density was highest between 900 and 1100 lm depth
(maximum: 0.09 boutons/lm dendrite). Note that the normalization to dendritic path length modiﬁed the VPM and POm
bouton proﬁles as the dendritic length density in a cortical
column varied with depth from the pia (Fig. 4A). The
normalized POm bouton density peak close to the pia was
relatively lower compared with the raw POm bouton density
peak (cf. green line in Figs 1B and 4B), reﬂecting the high
dendritic density below the pia due to the apical tufts.
TC Innervation Depends on Neuron Type and Soma
Depth
The normalized bouton density proﬁles (Fig. 4B) were then
multiplied by the dendritic z-proﬁles of individual neurons
(Fig. 2), yielding z-proﬁles of TC innervation density that
represent the distribution of the absolute number of VPM or
POm boutons contacting a given neuron at a given depth
(insets in Fig. 5B for the example neuron shown in Fig. 2).
To compare the potential TC input of different neuron types,
the average number of POm and VPM boutons per type was
calculated from the integrals of these individual thalamic
contact density z-proﬁles (see insets in Fig. 5). The cell types

primary bifurcation (n = 7, soma distance from pia: 124--275
lm); L3 pyramidal neurons had longer apical dendrites with
narrower apical tufts and longer basal dendrites (n = 9, somato-pia distance: 295--529 lm); L4 star pyramidal neurons had an
apical dendrite that did not reach L1 and had no prominent tuft
(n = 6, soma-to-pia distance: 614--750 lm); L4 spiny stellate
neurons had short mostly asymmetric primary dendrites and
did not show a prominent apical dendrite (n = 7, soma-to-pia
distance: 607--802 lm); L5 slender-tufted pyramidal neurons
had a small apical tuft and few apical oblique dendrites (n = 20,
soma-to-pia distance: 772--975 lm); L5 thick-tufted pyramidal
neurons had a broad apical tuft and more apical oblique
dendrites (n = 22, soma-to-pia distance: 997--1251 lm); L6
pyramidal neurons had apical dendrites that did not reach
beyond L4 (n = 11, soma-to-pia distance: 1269--1617 lm, cf.
Brumberg et al. 2003; Andjelic et al. 2009). According to their
soma depth, the L6 neurons in our sample may be regarded as
L6A neurons (Torres-Reveron and Friedlander 2007). We did
not differentiate different dendritic subtypes of L6 neurons
(Kumar and Ohana 2008; Andjelic et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2009).
Figure 3 shows examples of individual somatic and dendritic
reconstructions representative of the 7 excitatory cell types,
superimposed on VPM (left panels) and POm (right panels)
bouton z-proﬁles. Any overlap of domains of high thalamic
bouton density and dendritic arbors of cortical neurons
indicates that these neurons could receive direct thalamic
input after a sensory stimulus.

were signiﬁcantly different in average VPM innervation
(P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA; Table 1 and Fig. 5), with a peak
for L5 thick-tufted pyramidal neurons (299 ± 99 boutons per
neuron). The mean VPM innervation of L5 thick-tufted
pyramidal neurons was signiﬁcantly higher than VPM innervation of L2 (16 ± 14), L5 slender-tufted (150 ± 50), and
L6 (131 ± 66) pyramidal neurons (P < 0.05, multiple
comparison test, Scheffe´ procedure). There was no signiﬁcant
difference between L3 (222 ± 131), L4 (star pyramidal neurons:
197 ± 46; spiny stellates: 188 ± 60), L5 slender-tufted, and L6
neurons. This shows that, on average, excitatory neurons in
layers 3, 4, 5, and 6 can receive signiﬁcant VPM innervation.
Potential POm innervation was highest for L5 pyramidal
neurons (slender tufted: 269 ± 121; thick tufted: 277 ± 67)
and showed higher variability for the other neuron types (see
Table 1). All excitatory neuron types with the exception of L4
spiny stellates potentially receive at least 60 POm boutons.
We then analyzed the correlation of soma depth and TC
innervation for different neurons of the same type. Total
dendritic length (i.e., the integrals of dendritic z-proﬁles, cf.
Fig. 2) was not found to be signiﬁcantly depth dependent for
any neuron type (open circles in Fig. 5A). When total VPM
innervation per neuron was plotted as a function of pia--soma
distance (open circles in Fig. 5B), however, L3, L5, and L6
pyramidal neurons showed a dependence on soma depth, and 2
patterns emerged: While the innervation of L3 (r = 0.87,
P < 0.01) and L5 thick-tufted (r = 0.70, P < 0.001) pyramidal
neurons increased signiﬁcantly with increasing soma depth,
VPM innervation decreased for L5 slender-tufted (r = –0.46,
P < 0.05) and L6 (r = –0.92, P < 0.0001) pyramidal neurons. For
L5 and L6 neurons, POm innervation also depended on soma
depth (open circles in Fig. 5C): In contrast to VPM innervation,
POm innervation increased with soma depth for L5 slender2294 Thalamic Innervation of a Cortical Column

tufted neurons (r = 0.57, P < 0.01), while it decreased for L5
thick-tufted neurons (r = –0.57, P < 0.01). For L6 pyramidal
neurons, POm innervation, like VPM innervation, decreased
with soma depth (r = –0.75, P < 0.01). These correlations
indicate that, anatomically, there is a high variability in potential
TC input of L3, L5, and L6 neurons, which can be, in part,
explained by the vertical position of the individual neurons in
the cortical column that determines the axodendritic overlap.
Subcellular TC Innervation Domains for 7 Excitatory
Neuron Types
We ﬁnally quantiﬁed potential subcellular TC innervation
domains for each type of excitatory neuron. Figure 6 shows
averaged soma-centered dendritic z-proﬁles (left panels) and
thalamic contact density z-proﬁles (VPM: middle panel, POm:
right panel) of all 7 types of excitatory neurons (for an
illustration of the underlying anatomical overlap, cf. Fig. 3; for
calculation of contact density z-proﬁles, cf. Fig. 4). Each contact
z-proﬁle represents the vertical distribution of potential
thalamic input along the dendritic compartments of a particular
type. The number of potential TC contacts for each cell type,
speciﬁed for the basal dendrites, proximal apical oblique
dendrites, distal apical oblique dendrites, and apical tuft
dendrites is reported in Table 2.
Figure 6 shows that pyramidal neurons in L2 are likely to
receive POm input at their apical tufts and probably lack VPM
input. Pyramidal neurons in L3 are likely to receive strong VPM
input at their basal and apical oblique dendrites, and, to
a smaller degree, distributed POm input at their apical oblique
dendrites and apical tuft. L4 spiny stellate neurons are likely to
receive almost exclusively VPM input. L4 star pyramidal
neurons are likely to receive VPM input at their basal dendrites
and apical oblique dendrites and POm input at their basal

dendrites. L5 slender-tufted pyramidal neurons are likely to
receive VPM input at their apical oblique dendrites. They are
also likely to receive POm input at their basal and apical
oblique dendrites and, to a smaller degree, at their apical tuft.
L5 thick-tufted pyramidal neurons are likely to receive strong
VPM input at their basal dendrites and at their proximal and
distal apical obliques and in addition POm input at the proximal
apical oblique dendrites and at their apical tufts. Finally,
a fraction of L6 neurons is likely to receive VPM input at their
apical oblique dendrites.
In summary, dendritic ﬁelds of all excitatory neuron types
overlap with thalamic boutons. L3 pyramidal neurons, L4 star
pyramidal neurons, and L5 slender-tufted and L5 thick-tufted
pyramidal neurons can all receive direct thalamic input
originating from 2 different thalamic subnuclei.
Subcellular TC Innervation Domains Deﬁne a Subtype
of Thick-Tufted L5B Neurons
We found a small fraction of thick-tufted L5B pyramidal
neurons (n = 4 of 22) that extended a substantial part of their
apical oblique dendrites to L4 (Fig. 7A, right panel for an
example), while the majority of thick-tufted neurons had
virtually no dendrites in L4 (e.g., Fig. 7A, left panel; see
Supplementary Fig. 3 for all L5B reconstructions). Quantitatively, these neurons were identiﬁed by a cluster analysis with
the number of apical oblique dendrites in L4 and the total
dendritic path length in L4 as parameters (Fig. 7B, right panel,
see Materials and Methods). They had more than 4 apical
oblique dendrites and more than 1 mm dendritic path length in
L4 (Fig. 7B, left panel). Because this speciﬁc branching was well
aligned with the VPM projections terminating in L4, this subtype
of L5B neurons had a fourth subcellular TC innervation domain,
which the majority of L5B cells did not show (Fig. 7C vs. D,
Supplementary Table 2; predicted number of TC boutons per
neuron in the L4 innervation domain: 132 ± 72 [n = 4] vs. 29 ±
5.8 [n = 18], P < 0.03; see Materials and Methods for details and
validity of this statistical test).

Neuron Type--Speciﬁc Subcellular Innervation Domains
The analysis of subcellular TC innervation domains on excitatory
cortical neurons (Figs 6--8 and Table 2) revealed highly cell type-speciﬁc innervation patterns. These can be interpreted as follows
(see Figs 6 and 8): TC innervation was ‘‘focal’’ and ‘‘unique’’ (one
subcellular innervation domain, innervation by one thalamic
nucleus) for pyramidal neurons in L2 (POm innervation domain
at the apical tuft), L4 spiny stellate neurons (VPM innervation
domain throughout their entire dendritic ﬁeld), and lower
L6 pyramidal neurons (VPM innervation domain at their apical
oblique dendrites, cf. also Fig. 5B). Pyramidal neurons in L3, L4,
L5, and upper L6 on the other hand showed ‘‘multiple’’ and ‘‘dual’’
TC innervation (2, 3, or 4 subcellular innervation domains,
innervation by 2 thalamic nuclei). For L2 pyramidal neurons,
TC innervation was restricted to a rather broad innervation
domain by POm at their apical tuft, whereas their remaining
dendritic compartments were potentially only sparsely contacted by TC projections at all. Basal and apical oblique dendrites
of L2 pyramidal neurons may be targeted mainly by intracortical
connections (Bannister 2005; Bureau et al. 2006).
Clustered versus Distributed Subcellular TC Innervation
Domains
We quantiﬁed both the total expected TC innervation per
neuron (Fig. 5 and Table 1) and the spatial distribution of TC
innervation along the dendrites of a given neuron (Figs 6--8 and
Table 2). While the ﬁrst method accurately describes the
expected total amount of TC input per neuron, the latter is
better suited to detect clustered innervation domains along the
dendrites of a given neuron type. However, it underestimates
distributed innervation. It is therefore questionable whether
the weak average innervation of L4 spiny stellates by POm
(Figs 6 and 8; cf. Fig. 5C; 22 ± 10 POm boutons total, see
Table 1) and the innervation of L2 pyramidal neurons by VPM
(Figs 6 and 8; cf. Fig. 5B; 16 ± 14 VPM boutons total, see Table 1)
in fact represent signiﬁcant thalamic input to these neurons.
Some L6A pyramidal neurons extend their apical tufts to L5A
where they could receive signiﬁcant POm input (cf. Figs 3, 5C,
6, and 8). This is only evident in the analysis of the total
expected innervation per neuron (Fig. 5C and Table 1; 66 ± 42
POm boutons total), especially for upper L6A neurons (Fig. 5C).
Note that all other types of pyramidal neurons (located in L2-L5) can receive POm input within L1 where all of these types
of pyramidal neurons extend their apical tufts; it is possible that
upper L6 pyramidal neurons, although they do not extend an
apical dendrite to L1 (see also, e.g., Chen et al. 2009), can
potentially still integrate POm and VPM input.

Note: Integrals of the thalamocortical innervation density profiles (as in Table 1), differentiated by
the dendritic domains of each excitatory neuron type. Dendritic domains were defined using the
dendritic length density profiles (see Fig. 2, cf. Supplementary Fig. 3): basal dendrites: below the
soma; apical tuft dendrites: above the first bin of the apical tuft dendritic density peak; the
remaining part of the dendritic density profile was split in half to approximately define proximal

barrel cortex. For this purpose, the dendritic domains of the
neuron types were superimposed with TC bouton domains,
and absolute numbers of TC innervation were estimated. In
previous work, these neurons were shown to respond to
a simple sensory stimulus (whisker deﬂection) in a typespeciﬁc manner (Brecht and Sakmann 2002; Brecht et al. 2003;
Manns et al. 2004; de Kock et al. 2007). The present results
suggest a possible anatomical basis for at least some of the cell
type--speciﬁc responses.

distinguish excitatory cell types. We found, however, that
within the assumed homogeneous class of excitatory thicktufted L5 pyramidal neurons, speciﬁc branching features of the
apical oblique dendrites that were well aligned with the VPM
innervation pattern yielded strongly differing subcellular innervation domains for a few of the neurons (see Fig. 7). This
could suggest subtypes of thick-tufted L5B neurons. Similarly,
L6 pyramidal neurons could be further differentiated by, for
example, the extent of their apical dendrites in L5A or L4,
possibly predicted by their soma locations (Fig. 5B,C). In both
cases, the selectivity of the thalamic projections along the
vertical column axis attaches potential functional relevance
to the purely morphological ﬁnding of variable dendritic
branching patterns. Thus, the predicted TC input patterns
can contribute to a more precise classiﬁcation of excitatory
neurons within the layers of a cortical column.

Estimation of Absolute TC Bouton Numbers per Neuron
For a quantitative interpretation of the TC input to a cortical
column, it was crucial to obtain absolute estimates of the
number of potential TC contacts per excitatory neuron in
a column. These estimates relied on a few anatomical
assumptions, each of which contributes to the uncertainty of
the estimate. The total number of boutons projected from one
VPM barreloid to one cortical column was estimated using the
reported number of neurons in a VPM barreloid (250--300; Land
et al. [1995], expected uncertainty range: 200--300, e.g., Varga
et al. [2002]), the average axonal path length of one VPM
neuron extended in the home column (35 mm, approximate
range: 20--50 mm, Oberlaender, Bruno, and Sakmann, unpublished observations), and the average distance between
boutons on the TC axons (3 ± 0.2 lm, Oberlaender, Bruno, and
Sakmann, unpublished observations; cf. however, 5 lm in

mouse; White et al. 2004). The ratio of excitatory neurons in
a column was assumed to be 85% (Beaulieu 1993; range:
80--90%). All of these assumptions contribute as multiplicative
factors to the estimates of absolute bouton numbers; thus, the
combined uncertainty for all estimates of absolute bouton
numbers is approximately ±30%. In addition, the ratio of
excitatory neurons is inhomogeneous along the vertical column
axis (e.g., Beaulieu 1993). However, compared to the uncertainties in the assumptions about the number of total TC
boutons, this variability in the ratio of inhibitory neurons (range:
10--20% for different cortical layers) is of less signiﬁcance.
We used an estimate of the total axonal path length of the
average VPM neuron extended in the somatotopically aligned
home column (see above, Materials and Methods). VPM
neurons also project to neighboring columns and the septa
between barrels in cortex; these projections can amount to as
much as 40% of the axonal path length (Oberlaender, Bruno,
and Sakmann, unpublished observations). Therefore, the
absolute estimates of the number of potential TC contacts
per excitatory neuron reported here are lower estimates of the
total TC input to a single neuron. To account for TC input from
other than the somatotopically aligned barreloid, the reported
numbers (Tables 1 and 2) would have to be increased by
approximately 10--30% (assuming that dendrites of septal

neurons contribute ~40--50% to the total dendritic length in
barrel cortex, see Meyer et al. [2010] and Materials and
Methods). Thus, approximately half of the additional VPM
projections could target neurons within the home column.

The Number of VPM Boutons per Neuron in Comparison
to Previous Studies
First accounts of TC projections in primary sensory areas
concluded that the primary target of TC axons were neurons in
layer 4 (Lorente de No 1922, 1938, 1992; Jones and Powell
1970; Killackey 1973). Subsequent ultrastructural analysis using
electron microscopy of combined axon degeneration (without
differentiation between VPM and POm) and Golgi staining or
anterograde transporter labeling demonstrated, however, that
also deep L3 pyramidal neurons and L5 and L6 pyramidal
neurons were contacted by TC afferents within L4 (White
1978, 1989; Keller et al. 1985). It was concluded (Peters 1979;
White 1979) that all neurons extending their dendrites to L4
received thalamic input. Furthermore, the fraction of putatively
excitatory (asymmetric) synapses that was made by TC
afferents was estimated to be as high as 18--23% in mouse
barrel cortex (Hersch and White 1981, 1982; White and Hersch
1981; Keller et al. 1985; White 1989), while much lower

Figure 8. Subcellular thalamocortical innervation domains for different excitatory neuron types in a cortical column. Thalamocortical innervation domains calculated by
thresholding the contact z-profiles (cf. Fig. 6) at bouton densities of 5 per bin (effective bin size: 46 lm, cf. Materials and Methods; dark red and dark green for VPM and POm,
respectively) and 10 per bin (light colors). Each neuron type showed a unique combination of subcellular thalamocortical innervation domains (see Discussion).

TC Projections from VPM versus POm
We used the peak bouton density to calibrate VPM and POm
projection densities (see Materials and Methods). This allowed
to quantitatively compare the amount of thalamic projections
converging on cortical neurons from either one or both
thalamic nuclei. We found that the estimated number of VPM
boutons was remarkably similar for L3, L4, and L5 excitatory
neurons (estimated range: 150--299 VPM boutons per neuron;
Table 1 and Fig. 5B). L6 pyramidal neurons were still predicted
to receive 131 ± 66 VPM boutons per neuron, and only L2
pyramidal neurons are predicted to have virtually no VPM input
(16 ± 14). The intertype variability was higher for the number
of POm boutons per neuron type, with L5 slender-tufted (269 ±
121) and L5 thick-tufted (277 ± 67) pyramidal neurons
potentially receiving about 4--5 times as many synapses as the
other pyramidal neurons (range: 57--75). L5 slender-tufted
pyramidal neurons were predicted to be the most densely
POm-innervated neurons, with a synapse distance of 21 lm and
a ratio of POm-occupied spines of 9%. Our data predict that
thick-tufted L5 pyramidal neurons receive equal amounts of TC
input from VPM and POm (with the exception of the putative
subtype that has an L4--VPM domain as described in Fig. 7),
while the TC input to all other cortical neurons is either VPM
dominated (L3, L4, and L6) or POm dominated (L2 and L5
slender tufted).
Comparison with Estimates Derived from Physiological
Measurements
The different patterns of TC innervation reported here are
based on calculating bouton--dendrite overlap proﬁles, making
the simplifying assumption of locally random synaptic connectivity between TC axons and the dendrites of cortical neurons
(Peters 1979; White 1979, 1989; see Shepherd et al. 2005;
Stepanyants and Chklovskii 2005 for a critical account). The
results reported here therefore represent ‘‘potential’’ synaptic
connectivity and provide ﬁrst quantitative bounds on the
amount of TC innervation of cortical neurons. Whether the
overlap regions that we calculated here indeed correspond to
actual synaptic contacts needs to be veriﬁed by, for example,
labeling synaptic contacts simultaneously with markers speciﬁc
for the pre- and postsynaptic compartments or by electron

microscopic methods suitable to image large volumes like
an entire layer of a cortical column (for a review, see
Helmstaedter, Briggman, et al. 2008).
Qualitatively, the fact that, in response to a whisker deﬂection, reliable, short onset latency (8--11 ms) excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) are recorded in all cortical layers
except in L2 (18 ms) (Brecht and Sakmann 2002; Brecht et al.
2003; Manns et al. 2004) renders it likely that the bouton-dendrite overlap domains described here represent indeed
functional TC innervation domains as we found signiﬁcant VPM
innervation for all neuron types except for L2 (Figs 5--8 and
Table 1). The onset latency of the earliest EPSP component in
L3 pyramidal neurons (9.6 ms), for example, is not signiﬁcantly
different from that of the earliest component of EPSPs in L4
spiny stellate neurons (8.0 ms) (Brecht and Sakmann 2002;
Brecht et al. 2003). This argues for signiﬁcant monosynaptic TC
activation of both neuron types, which is in agreement with
our anatomical data (222 ± 44 vs. 188 ± 23 [mean ± standard
error of mean] VPM boutons per neuron, respectively). It is,
however, important to note that high bouton numbers per
neuron or dense innervation domains close to the soma do not
directly imply higher activation since release probability may
be different for different connections (Markram et al. 1998;
Reyes et al. 1998; Reyes and Sakmann 1999) and since
intracellular mechanisms may signiﬁcantly modify the effect
of a single synaptic contact depending on the location along
the dendritic tree (see below).
Previous quantitative estimates of VPM innervation were
based on inferences of VPM convergence onto excitatory
L4 neurons (based on the fraction of connected pairs; Bruno
and Sakmann 2006) and the average number of release sites for
a single VPM--L4 connection (Gil et al. 1999). This suggested
that the maximum possible number of VPM release sites that
could contact a spiny stellate cell is approximately 600. Our
lower bound anatomical estimate of the number of contacts
(~200 VPM boutons per L4 neuron, cf. Table 1) lies well below
this upper bound estimate for the number of release sites. This
could suggest possible multiquantal release at VPM boutons.
More recent anatomical data seem to support the order of
magnitude of approximately 200 VPM boutons per L4 neuron
(Schoonover and Bruno, in preparation).
Recently, the input to cortical excitatory neurons has been
studied using the expression of a light-activatable cation
channel (Nagel et al. 2003) in populations of putatively
presynaptic axons; among these were TC afferences (Petreanu
et al. 2009). It was concluded that L5B pyramidal neurons lack
signiﬁcant POm input in disagreement with the anatomical
predictions presented in this study (Figs 6--8 and Tables 1 and
2). Several reasons may contribute to this discrepancy. Our data
suggest that apical tuft input could be a major factor for the
excitation of L5 thick-tufted pyramidal neurons by POm (25%
of all POm boutons per L5 thick-tufted pyramid; Table 2,
Supplementary Table 2). The detection of apical tuft input is,
however, hard to achieve in L5 thick-tufted neurons given their
low input resistance, the lack of voltage control of distant
dendrites in the setting of a somatic recording, and the strong
attenuation of distally evoked spikes along the dendritic tree
(Larkum et al. 2009). Even for basal dendrites the attenuation of
synaptic input can be substantial (Nevian et al. 2007). In
addition, the contribution of active dendritic mechanisms like
calcium APs to the somatic current signal (Larkum et al. 2009)
is difﬁcult to assess. It remains to be shown by ultrastructural

numbers were obtained for visual cortex (e.g., Garey and
Powell 1971; da Costa and Martin 2009).
Our ﬁndings quantitatively conﬁrm that 1) all neurons in
a column potentially receive substantial TC input (90--580
boutons per neuron) and that 2) the fraction of potential TC
synapses per neuron is at least 17% for spiny stellates in
L4 (range: 4--17% for all excitatory neuron types, see Table 1;
note that this is a lower bound estimate because we did not
calculate TC input from other than the somatotopically aligned
barreloids, see above). However, our data suggest that a substantial fraction of these potential TC synapses is not made
within L4 but in the supra- and infragranular parts of the
TC projections. For example, we estimate only 20--30% of all
VPM boutons on an L5 thick-tufted pyramidal neuron to be
made in L4 (~55 of ~300; Table 2 and Figs 6 and 8, or ~90 of
~300, Supplementary Table 2), while the remaining contacts
would be established mainly in L5. Our data do not support
signiﬁcant monosynaptic VPM input to L1 (reported by Oda
et al. [2004], see, however, Rubio-Garrido et al. [2009]).

Conclusions
The anatomical data suggest, in combination with the
synchrony of APs in VPM cells (Bruno and Sakmann 2006),
2 limiting cases for an ‘‘effective’’ TC excitation of the cortex.
On the one hand, it is based on a focal and dense input to
a compact dendritic compartment, as has been quantiﬁed for
L4 spiny stellate neurons. This neuron type is thought to be the
main recipient of sensory input to a column in somatosensory
cortex (Armstrong-James et al. 1992; Douglas and Martin 2004).
On the other hand, effective excitation in the vibrissal cortex is
also based on a spatially distributed input to several anatomically and electrically well-separated dendritic compartments
(Larkum and Zhu 2002). This is the case for L5 thick-tufted
pyramidal neurons. Here, the effective TC activation relies on
the generation of active dendritic excitation by distributed
synaptic input (Larkum et al. 2001).
In combination with data on functional geometry of TC
connectivity (i.e., paired recordings; Bruno and Sakmann 2006),
the quantitative data on thalamic innervation patterns of the
major excitatory neuron types will serve as a basis for
simulations of the signal ﬂow through a cortical column in
silico (Helmstaedter et al. 2007).

Functional Implications: Capacity for Coincidence
Detection by Pyramidal Neurons
The highest number of potential VPM contacts is received by
thick-tufted neurons in the infragranular layer (L5), whereas
contact density is highest for spiny cells in the granular layer
(Table 1). In vivo recordings of AP responses have shown that
L5 thick-tufted pyramidal neurons respond to a whisker
deﬂection as rapidly as L4 spiny stellate neurons do but, on
average, with a higher number of APs (de Kock et al. 2007).
Thick-tufted pyramidal neurons are sensitive to coincident input
to different dendritic compartments and typically respond with
AP bursts to multilayer synaptic input (Larkum et al. 1999;
Larkum and Zhu 2002). These observations are surprising, given
the fact that input resistance of L5 thick-tufted pyramidal
neurons is considerably lower than that of spiny stellates and
because of the strong attenuation of post-synaptic potentials
(PSPs) along their basal dendrites (Nevian et al. 2007). One
factor that could contribute to the higher responsiveness of
thick-tufted pyramidal neurons is their multiple innervation by
VPM on their basal and apical oblique dendrites, respectively
(Figs 6--8 and Table 2). Our sample contained a subset of cells
that had a dense dendritic domain in L4, putatively enabling in
particular those neurons to integrate VPM input at 2 dendritic
compartments (Fig. 7).
In addition, coincident input to basal and apical oblique
dendrites from VPM and to apical oblique and apical tuft
dendrites from POm could generate bursts of APs, as observed
in vitro and in vivo (Larkum et al. 2001; de Kock et al. 2007;
Schaefer et al. 2007; de Kock and Sakmann 2008). Larkum and
colleagues found that, in distal tuft dendrites of L5 thick-tufted
pyramidal neurons, attenuation of NMDA-mediated spikes is
strong, but they estimated that approximately 100 tuft synapses
can be sufﬁcient to trigger a calcium spike at the apical
initiation zone (Larkum et al. 2009). This is approximately 25%
more than the 68 POm boutons and 12 VPM boutons per tuft
predicted as a lower bound by the present study (Table 2),
indicating that synchronous POm activity could be close to the
threshold of initiating active propagation of distal inputs to the
axon initial segment for integration with proximal input (see
also Larkum et al. 2004). As discussed above, this nonlinear
transmission of apical tuft input to the soma may explain the
substantial discrepancy between our predictions and physiological data based on the activation of, presumably, a few POm
afferents (Petreanu et al. 2009).
A dual TC innervation pattern is also suggested for pyramidal
neurons located in L3. These cells are potentially innervated by
VPM at their basal dendrites and potentially receive input from
POm at their apical tufts in L1 (Figs 6 and 8). L2/3 pyramidal
neurons can generate dendritic spikes and integrate distal and
proximal synaptic input, which, however, only results in brief
‘‘bursts’’ of 2 APs in vitro (Larkum et al. 2007). AP bursts from
L3 pyramidal neurons are in fact infrequent and consist of only
2 APs in in vivo recordings from the anesthetized cortex
(de Kock and Sakmann 2008). In the awake animal, however,
they become more frequent and can consist of 3 APs (de Kock
and Sakmann 2008). This difference in the awake animal could,
for example, result from increased POm activity, which could
be mediated by arousal (Trageser and Keller 2004; Trageser

et al. 2006) or from reduced inhibition at the distal dendrites
(see Larkum et al. 2007). To investigate these potential effects
of TC innervation in vivo, experiments are needed where
L1 excitation in awake animals is measured (Kuhn et al. 2008;
Murayama and Larkum 2009; Murayama et al. 2009).
A dual TC innervation, distributed over multiple dendritic
compartments, is also suggested for slender-tufted pyramidal
neurons in L5. Both their basal and their apical dendrites
overlap with POm bouton domains. The early compound PSP
evoked by a whisker deﬂection also has, however, a short
latency (~10 ms) (Manns et al. 2004). Presumably, the VPM
projections to apical oblique dendrites mediate this early-onset
PSP (Figs 6 and 8). APs in L5 slender-tufted pyramidal neurons
are, however, evoked with a relatively long delay compared
with other layers (de Kock et al. 2007), suggesting that the
early-onset synaptic input is either weak or attenuated by rapid
inhibition. The APs occurring later could then be evoked by
the L4 spiny stellate-to-L5 slender-tufted pyramid pathway
(Feldmeyer et al. 2005; Schubert et al. 2006), which would
represent a disynaptic input from VPM. Slender-tufted pyramidal neurons could then be sensitive to coincident excitation
conveyed by this disynaptic VPM pathway (to their basal and
proximal apical oblique dendrites) and inputs from the POm
pathway that excite their basal and apical oblique dendrites and
the apical tufts in L1. Finally, the excitation of slender-tufted
cells is increased during active whisking (Kerr et al. 2007;
de Kock and Sakmann 2009), suggesting increased input from
VPM and potentially direct input from POm in the awake
behaving condition.

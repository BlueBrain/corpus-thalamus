The risk of neurological diseases increases with age. In WAG/Rij rat model of absence epilepsy, the incidence of epileptic spikewave discharges is known to be elevated with age. Considering close relationship between epileptic spike-wave discharges and
physiologic sleep spindles, it was assumed that age-dependent increase of epileptic activity may affect time-frequency characteristics
of sleep spindles. In order to examine this hypothesis, electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded in WAG/Rij rats successively
at the ages 5, 7, and 9 months. Spike-wave discharges and sleep spindles were detected in frontal EEG channel. Sleep spindles
were identified automatically using wavelet-based algorithm. Instantaneous (localized in time) frequency of sleep spindles was
determined using continuous wavelet transform of EEG signal, and intraspindle frequency dynamics were further examined. It
was found that in 5-months-old rats epileptic activity has not fully developed (preclinical stage) and sleep spindles demonstrated
an increase of instantaneous frequency from beginning to the end. At the age of 7 and 9 months, when animals developed matured
and longer epileptic discharges (symptomatic stage), their sleep spindles did not display changes of intrinsic frequency. The present
data suggest that age-dependent increase of epileptic activity in WAG/Rij rats affects intrinsic dynamics of sleep spindle frequency.

1. Introduction
Sleep spindles are well-known EEG phenomena that reflect
spontaneous rhythmic activity of thalamocortical neuronal
network during non-REM sleep [1–3]. In vivo experiments
demonstrated a close relationship between sleep spindles
and epileptic spike-wave discharges (SWD) [4–6]. SWD
are electroencephalographic (EEG) manifestation of absence
epilepsy, and they are triggered by the cortex, opposite
to sleep spindles, which are known to originate from the
thalamus (reviewed in [7]). In comparison to sleep spindles,
SWD are underlain by more intensive excitation and/or
synchronization processes in thalamocortical network [7–9].

Previously we demonstrated that sleep spindles and SWD
showed different time-frequency characteristics, as measured
in the cortex and thalamus [10].
Intraspindle frequency is an important parameter characterizing intrinsic properties of thalamocortical network
activity [11, 12] with respect to generation of autonomous
oscillations. In healthy human subjects, the frequency of
sleep spindles is known to vary from 10 to 16 Hz (e.g.,
[2, 12, 13]), and in animals (rats and cats) from 7 to 14 Hz
[1, 14]. Recently we compared time-frequency characteristics
of the anterior sleep spindles in nonepileptic Wistar and
epileptic WAG/Rij rats (genetic model of absence epilepsy)
[15] and demonstrated that instantaneous frequency of sleep

2
spindles in symptomatic WAG/Rij rats was constant during a
spindle event, opposite to ascending dynamics of intraspindle
frequency in control Wistar rats. We also found [16] that
∼50% of anterior sleep spindles in WAG/Rij rats (at the age
between 5 and 9 months) appeared in EEG with the frequency
between 8 and 10 Hz (mean ∼9.3 Hz), 20–25% of spindles—
with frequency between 10 and 12 Hz (∼11.4 Hz), and 25–
30%—between 12 and 14 Hz (∼13.4 Hz), whereas an increase
of intrinsic frequency during sleep spindle was found at the
younger age (5 months) and only in ∼9.3 and ∼11.4 Hz sleep
spindles, but not in ∼13.4 Hz spindles. It is well known that
the number and duration of SWD in WAG/Rij rats increase
with age [17–19], although age-dependent changes in sleep
spindles are still uncertain. Considering close relationship
between epileptic spike-wave discharges and physiologic
sleep spindles, it was assumed that age-dependent increase
of epileptic activity may affect time-frequency characteristics
of sleep spindles. In order to examine this hypothesis in
the current study, we compared dynamics of intraspindle
frequency in WAG/Rij rats at the younger age (preclinical
state) and elder (symptomatic) ages, when SWD are fully
developed in EEG.

2. Materials and Methods
Experiments were conducted in six male WAG/Rij rats at the
Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology
RAS and were approved by the Ethical Committee on Animal
Experimentation of this Institution. EEGs were recorded
during three successive sessions at the age of ∼5 months
(from 4.8 to 5), ∼7 months (6.8–7.1), and ∼9 months (8.5–
9). Rats were equipped with metal screw electrodes that
were implanted epidurally at the right hemisphere over the
frontal cortex (coordinates: AP +2 mm and L 2.5 mm relative
to bregma), parietal (AP −2 mm; L 5.5 mm) and occipital
areas (AP −5 mm; L 3 mm) under chloral hydrate anesthesia
(325 mg/kg, 4% solution in 0.9% NaCl). Recordings were
made continuously during a period of 24 hours in freely
moving rats. EEG signals were band-pass filtered between 0.5
and 200 Hz, digitized with 400 samples/second/per channel,
and stored on hard disk. Only frontal EEG data were used
for time-frequency analysis (because sleep spindles showed
maximum amplitude in the frontal channel), while occipital
and parietal EEGs were used to facilitate determining the
state of vigilance, in particular, slow wave sleep.
Sleep spindles and SWD were investigated in frontal EEG
(Figure 1) for the reason that they both displayed amplitude
maximum in this (anterior) area [5, 8, 14, 17, 19]. SWD were
detected visually as a sequence of repetitive high-voltage
negative spikes and negative waves that lasted longer than
1 sec; amplitude of SWD exceeded background more than
three times [5, 17, 18]. The number and duration of SWD
were scored in 6-hour interval during dark phase. Sleep
spindles were recognized in EEG as 8–14 Hz waves with
characteristic waxing-waning morphology and symmetrical
waveform, whose amplitude exceeded background level at
least twice.

Neuroscience Journal
The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was used for
time-frequency analysis of sleep spindles in EEG as recorded
during dark phase. Three to 5 intervals during slow-wave
sleep (duration 15–30 s) per animal in each age group were
extracted. The CWT, 𝑊(𝑠, 𝜏), was obtained by convolving the
EEG signal, 𝑥(𝑡), with the basis function 𝜙0

Sleep spindles were detected automatically using earlier
developed wavelet-based algorithm in frontal EEG in 15–30 s
intervals during slow-wave sleep [15, 16, 20]. Briefly, wavelet
energy 𝑤(𝑡) was measured in the spindle frequency band, 𝐹 ∈

The value of 𝑤(𝑡) was averaged in the time window 𝑇:
⟨𝑤 (𝑡)⟩ = ∫

𝑡+𝑇

𝑡−𝑇

𝑤 (𝑡󸀠 ) 𝑑𝑡󸀠 .

(4)

The best quality of automatic recognition was achieved
when 𝑇 was set to 0.5 s that roughly corresponded to the
averaged duration of a sleep spindle. Finally, the threshold
level of wavelet power, 𝑤𝑐 , was empirically defined and sleep
spindles were identified under condition ⟨𝑤(𝑡)⟩ > 𝑤𝑐 . In
order to determine the end point of sleep spindles, wavelet
power of background EEG was averaged in the frequency
band 𝐹 ∈ (8, 16) Hz over the time period of 10 s, 𝑤0 . The
value of 𝑤0 was compared with the averaged wavelet power
in the same band 𝐹 ∈ (8, 16) Hz, ⟨𝑤(𝑡)⟩. The end point
of sleep spindle was assigned when ⟨𝑤(𝑡)⟩ < 0.25𝑤0 . The
true positive detections of sleep spindles reached 90–95% of
visually selected sleep spindles.
Rapid changes of the dominant frequency during sleep
spindles were explored using “skeletons” of wavelet surfaces
that were constructed based on the previously described
procedure [15, 16]. First, the instantaneous wavelet energy
distribution 𝐸𝑖 (𝑓𝑠 , 𝑡0 ) = |𝑊(𝑓𝑠 , 𝑡0 )|2 was computed for
the time moment 𝑡0 . Second, the function 𝐸𝑖 (𝑓𝑠 , 𝑡0 ) was
examined for the presence of local maxima, 𝐸max,𝑘 . If several
maxima were detected in 𝐸𝑖 (𝑓𝑠 , 𝑡0 ), the highest maximum was
selected and its frequency was considered as the dominant
frequency at the given time moment 𝑡0 . The value of the dominant frequency was used as the initial point in “skeleton.”
In order to plot the full “skeleton” of wavelet surface, the
abovementioned procedure was repeated for the next time

point. Skeletons of wavelet surfaces were constructed in 5 s
time intervals containing sleep spindles.
Nonparametric Friedman’s ANOVA was used for the
statistical analysis of age-dependent changes of measurable
parameters in EEG (with 3 levels of “age,” within-subject
design, repeated measures) and Wilcoxon matched pairs test
for the subsequent post hoc analysis.

3. Results
Epileptic activity in WAG/Rij rats increased with age. The
number of SWD increased in a period between 5 and 9
months of age from 3 to 38 discharges as counted in 6-hour
2
interval (Friedman test, 𝜒𝑁=6,
𝑑𝑓=2 = 6.5, 𝑃 < 0.05), as well
as the total duration of seizure activity as summed in 6 hours
2
(from 34 ± 20 s to 439 ± 281 s, 𝜒𝑁=6,
𝑑𝑓=2 = 8.0, 𝑃 < 0.05). At
the age of 5 months, SWD were completely absent in 4 out of
6 rats, and the rest two animals showed very few discharges
with immature waveform (waxing-winning envelope, low
frequency, and unstable amplitude of spikes, Figure 1). This
implies, first, that spike-wave activity in Moscow’s population
of WAG/Rij rats appeared at the older age as compared to
relatively early development of SWD in native population in
Nijmegen, in which SWD were known to be fully developed
at the age of 5 months [18]. Second, five months of age in
our rats might be considered as a preclinical state of absence
epilepsy.
In total, 115 sleep spindles were automatically selected
in EEG and analyzed in 5-month-old WAG/Rij rats, 117
spindles—in 7-month-old, and 115 spindles—in 9-monthold. Intrinsic frequency dynamics of sleep spindles were
examined using “skeletons” of wavelet surfaces constructed
in the spindle frequency band, 9–14 Hz. It was found that
instantaneous frequency of sleep spindles slightly changed
from the beginning to the end of each sleep spindle event.

Figure 2 demonstrates three examples of sleep spindles as
recorded in one individual at different ages and corresponding wavelet “skeletons.” An increase of dominant frequency
was observed from beginning to the end of a sleep spindle
only at the age of 5 months (ascending frequency dynamics in
the “skeleton” plot in Figure 2(a)), but it was no longer present
at the elder ages (Figures 2(b) and 2(c)).
For the statistical analysis, intraspindle frequency was
examined in wavelet “skeletons” by measuring the instantaneous frequency at the beginning (𝑓start ) and at the end (𝑓end )
of each sleep spindle.
It was found, first, that the value of 𝑓start increased with
2
age (𝜒𝑁=115,
𝑑𝑓=2 = 12.6, 𝑃 < 0.005). Second, the value of 𝑓start
at the age of 5 months was lower than that at the age of 7 and
9 months (pairwise Wilcoxon test, all 𝑃’s < 0.05, Figure 3).
Third, the difference between 𝑓start and 𝑓end significantly
2
changed with age (𝜒𝑁=115,
𝑑𝑓=2 = 11.3, 𝑃 < 0.005). According
to pairwise Wilcoxon test, ascending intraspindle frequency
dynamics, that is, 𝑓start < 𝑓end , were significant only in 5month-old WAG/Rij rats (𝑃 < 0.005), and at the age of 7 and
9 months, the difference between 𝑓start and 𝑓end disappeared
(𝑓start = 𝑓end , Figure 3).

4. Discussion
The current paper demonstrates that intrinsic frequency of
sleep spindles in WAG/Rij rat model of absence epilepsy
changed in parallel to the age-dependent increase of epileptic
spike-wave discharges in EEG. Five-month-old WAG/Rij rats
developed very few SWD with immature waveform; therefore
this age has been considered as preclinical stage. At this
age, intrinsic frequency of sleep spindles increased from
the beginning to the end. Similar elevation of intraspindle
frequency was found previously in nonepileptic Wistar rats at
the age of 7 and 9 months [15]. Therefore, in the present study,
intraspindle frequency dynamics in 5-month-old WAG/Rij

rats were similar to what was previously found in nonepileptic
Wistar [15].
Here it was found that the beginning value of spindle frequency (𝑓start ) in preclinical (5 months old) WAG/Rij rats was
significantly lower as compared to that in older ages (7 and 9
months), when epileptic discharges became more numerous
and epileptic activity became longer. Age-dependent increase
of absence seizures in WAG/Rij rats is well known from
the literature [17–19, 21]. Considering the present findings,
we can add that age-dependent increase of absence seizures
was associated with changes of intraspindle frequency, and
this might be caused by aggravation of epileptic activity
in thalamocortical neuronal network due to more intensive
excitation (hyperexcitation) and/or stronger synchronization
(hypersynchronization) [7–9]. Furthermore, the low start
value of the intraspindle frequency 𝑓start in preclinical (5
months old) WAG/Rij rats might reflect “normal” rhythmic
activity of thalamocortical network.
The current results might shed some light on the
controversial data about interrelation between sleep spindles and SWD [7, 8]. According to the present findings,
time-frequency profile of sleep spindles in presymptomatic
WAG/Rij rats was rather normal (and it was similar to agematched Wistar rats [15]), but it changed in older ages,
when thalamocortical network started producing epileptic
discharges. It can be concluded that qualitative changes of
sleep spindles were associated with quantitative changes in
SWD. It is not surprising, because it is well known that
SWD and sleep spindles share the same thalamocortical
pathways (reviewed in [1, 7]). Our previous study [21] and

the literature [22] indicated that time-frequency properties
of SWD changed with age; more specifically, the frequency of
immature SWD in younger rats was 5-6 Hz and it increased
to 9-10 Hz in older animals. Taken together, both kinds of
thalamocortical oscillations, that is, sleep spindles and SWD,
displayed age-related changes of time-frequency properties.
In order to explain an increase of intraspindle frequency
during sleep spindles in presymptomatic animals, we suggest
the following mechanism. It is well known that sleep spindles result from mutual interactions between glutamatergic
thalamocortical (TC) neurons in specific thalamic nuclei and
GABA-ergic cells in the reticular thalamic nucleus, RTN
(refs in [3]). Neurons in RTN have a propensity to trigger
spindle oscillations and fire in bursts at every cycle, acting
as pacemaker cells. TC cells receive inhibitory synaptic input
from the RTN and produce rhythmic bursts only once in
two to four cycles. Neuronal network mechanism of sleep
spindles includes four processes [1, 23]: (1) initial period—
spindle sequence is initiated by the pacemaker cells in the
RTN; (2) beginning of a spindle—some TC neurons are silent
during the first two-to-four bursts of RTN neurons and do not
return signals to the RTN; (3) the middle part of a spindle—
all TC cells burst synchronously with RTN neurons; (4)
termination of a spindle, which is putatively triggered by the
corticothalamic neurons. Here in presymptomatic animals
we found that the frequency at beginning of a spindle (the
stage 2 of the abovementioned process) was lower than at the
middle and at the end (the stage 3). It seems likely that at the
stage 3, more TC cells are recruited by RTN, and this results
in strengthening of rebound inhibition. Therefore duration

as negative sign that prerequisites development of epileptic
spike-wave discharges.
We believe that our findings would benefit development
of new methods for the early (preclinical) diagnosis of
epileptic diseases based on time-frequency properties of
EEG. Developing of new strategies acting at preclinical stage
(preventing epilepsy in a high-risk group) may be considered
as future directions in research.

Figure 3: Age-dependent changes of the instantaneous frequency
of sleep spindles in WAG/Rij rats as measured at the beginning
of a spindle, 𝑓start , and at the end, 𝑓end . Asterisk indicates that
instantaneous frequency in 5-month-old WAG/Rij rats was lower
than in older ages, and the effect 𝑓start < 𝑓end was significant only in
5-month-old WAG/Rij rats (pairwise Wilcoxon tests, all 𝑃’s < 0.05).

of each oscillatory cycle becomes shorter, and the frequency
of spindle oscillations increased at the end. In symptomatic
animals, the frequency of spindles at beginning (the stage
2) was higher than in presymptomatic animals; therefore,
all TC neurons in symptomatic rats might be recruited by
the RTN already at the beginning of sleep spindles (similar
to the stage 3), and this might lead to the “flattening” of
intraspindle frequency. This putative mechanism ought to
be investigated in the future. In general, our data indicate
that age-dependent development of absence seizures was
associated with “flattening” of intrinsic frequency of sleep
spindles. The present findings may be helpful for a better
understanding of the pathophysiology of absence epilepsy
and its probable correlation with sleep disorders, particularly
with those related to age.
Specific dynamics of intraspindle frequency were also
described in human sleep EEG. Changes of intraspindle
frequency (spectral “chirp”) in humans were investigated with
the aid of Matching Pursuit algorithm [23, 24]. In particular,
Sch¨onwald et al. [24] studied sleep spindles in C3-A2 EEG
channel in healthy subjects and showed the higher proportion
of negatively chirping spindles, suggesting that sleep spindles
in healthy humans tend to decelerate their frequency before
termination. In subjects with moderate obstructive sleep
apnea, there was a decrease in negatively chirping sleep, or
loss of sleep spindle deceleration. This effect was found only
in slow spindles and only in frontal and parietal regions
[25]. In the present study, flattening of intraspindle frequency
dynamics from 𝑓start < 𝑓end in preclinical WAG/Rij rats to
𝑓start = 𝑓end in symptomatic animals might be considered

Continuous wavelet transform was used for time-frequency
EEG analysis of sleep spindles in rats with genetic predisposition to absence epilepsy (WAG/Rij). It was found that
younger subjects at preclinical stage (5 months old) displayed
elevation of intraspindle frequency from the beginning to
the end of sleep spindles, but older subjects with fully blown
seizures (at the age of 7 and 9 months, symptomatic stage)
did not display any changes of intraspindle frequency. This
assumes that age-dependent elevation of epileptic activity
in WAG/Rij rats affects intrinsic dynamics of sleep spindle
frequency.

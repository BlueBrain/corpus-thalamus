SUMMARY

The purpose of this study was to investigate a potential relation between the K-complex
(KC) and sleep spindles of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage II of human sleep.
Using 58 electroencephalogram electrodes, plus standard electrooculogram and
electromyogram derivations for sleep staging, brain activity during undisturbed
whole-night sleep was recorded in six young adults (one of them participated twice).
NREM stage II spindles (1256 fast and 345 slow) and 1131 singular generalized KCs
were selected from all sleep cycles. The negative peak of the KC, the positive peak of the
KC (where applicable), and the prominent negative wave peak of slow and fast spindles
were marked as events of reference. Fast Fourier transform-based time–frequency
analysis was performed over the marked events, which showed that: (a) fast spindles
that happen to coincide with KC are interrupted (100% of 403 cases) and in their place
a slower rhythmic oscillation often (80%) appears; and (b) spindles that are usually
(72% of 1131) following KCs always have a higher frequency (by $1 Hz) than both the
interrupted spindles and the individual fast spindles that are not in any way associated
with a KC. This enhancement of spindle frequency could not be correlated to any of the
KC parameters studied. The results of this study reveal a consistent interaction between
the KC and the sleep spindle during NREM stage II in human sleep.

INTRODUCTION
The second stage of the human non-rapid eye movement
(NREM) sleep is characterized by two major electroencephalogram (EEG) graphoelements: the K-complex (KC) and the
sleep spindle. The KC is a delineated biphasic slow wave,
starting with a negative phase that may or may not be
immediately followed by a positive phase (Amzica and
Steriade, 2002; Colrain, 2005; Hala´sz, 2005). The sleep spindle
is a clearly distinguishable oscillatory rhythm of a waxing and
waning shape (De Gennaro and Ferrara, 2003). Two types of
sleep spindles have been described: fast spindles of a centroCorrespondence: George Kostopoulos, Neurophysiology Unit, Department of Physiology, University of Patras, 26500, Rion, Greece.

parietal dominance and a frequency varying $ 14 Hz; and
slow spindles of a frontal distribution and a frequency varying
$12 Hz (Gibbs and Gibbs, 1964).
Although the KC was ﬁrst described by Loomis et al. (1938)
70 years ago, its functional role is still a debatable issue. The
KC can appear either spontaneously or can be elicited by
external stimuli, is accompanied by autonomic alterations
(Hornyak et al., 1991; Okada et al., 1991; Roth et al., 1956;
Takehuchi et al., 1994; Tank et al., 2003), and may be
followed by arousals; therefore, it is considered by some to
be an arousal reaction. Other investigators argue that it is a
sleep-protecting mechanism, inhibiting arousals and promoting cortical processing (Colrain, 2005). Similarly, since its ﬁrst
description by Loomis et al. (1936), the function of the sleep
spindle also remains undeﬁned. There are data supporting its
role as an arousal inhibitor and thus a sleep preservation

mechanism (Yamadori, 1971). There are also data supporting
a role of spindles in memory consolidation during sleep (Gais
et al., 2002).
The idea of an antagonistic scheme between the KC and the
sleep spindle has progressively developed in literature. Ehrhart
et al. (1981) investigated the occurrence of both EEG phenomena before transient arousals during sleep, and found that
there is a lower incidence of sleep spindles in the 10-s interval
before the microarousal and an increase in KC appearance.
Benzodiazepine administration has been shown to increase
spindle appearance and decrease KCs (Gaillard and Tissot,
1975; Johnson et al., 1976; Kubicki et al., 1987; Naitoh et al.,
1982). Hala´sz (1993) reported a suppression of spindles for
5–15 s following evoked KCs, and so proposed that KCs are
Janus-face responses to arousal inputs, as they combine a slow
wave maintaining the continuity of sleep with an ability of
non-oscillating thalamocortical (TC) circuits to import information. The role attributed to the KC as being the forerunner
of delta waves of slow-wave sleep (SWS) supported an inverse
relation between KCs and sleep spindles, in accordance with
the inverse relationship between delta waves and sleep spindles
(De Gennaro and Ferrara, 2003; De Gennaro et al., 2000). On
the contrary, there are data supporting independent roles for
both KCs and sleep spindles. Church et al. (1978) showed that
the application of auditory stimuli during either the presence
or the absence of a sleep spindle did not inhibit the occurrence
of KCs but, moreover, evoked higher KCs. In addition,
auditory stimuli during spindle bursts produced no signiﬁcant
cardiovascular responses. The KC versus spindle interaction
results of Church et al. (1978) were conﬁrmed by Crowley
et al. (2004), and further complemented by the absence of agerelated eﬀects. Spindle occurrence is increased while spontaneous KCs are reduced throughout the night (Curcio et al.,
2003). Finally, in terms of pacing mechanisms, spindles are
thought to be paced by TC circuits, whereas KCs by intracortical networks, rather independently of the thalamus
(Amzica and Steriade, 2002).
The main objective of this study was to investigate a
potential relation between the KC and the sleep spindle, an
idea derived from the fact that they characterize the same stage
of sleep. More speciﬁcally, the question set was: ÔIf the two
phenomena are somehow related, then upon their coincidence
shouldnÕt one of them inﬂuence one or more characteristics of
the other?Õ. This study diﬀers from past approaches that
investigated the relation between KC and spindles in the
application of event-related techniques on manually selected
and sorted EEG epochs according to prominent features of
those two EEG elements. We distinguished and selected
singular generalized spontaneous KCs, that is, KCs not
immediately preceded or followed by another KC or slowwave activity, distinguishable across the midline electrodes,
occurring spontaneously. We also distinguished and selected
both slow and fast spindles in order to determine which group
interacts with the KC. The event-related methodology was
powered by time–frequency analysis and electrode space
mapping.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects and procedures
Six individuals (one male and ﬁve females) aged between 27
and 33 years (mean age 28.8 ± 2.56 years) volunteered to
participate in this study. One of the subjects participated twice,
to check for reproducibility of sleep features, thus completing a
total of seven nocturnal sleep recordings. All participants were
good sleepers, without any diﬃculties in falling or remaining
asleep during the night. They were all in good health and free
from medication at the time of study. None of the subjects
reported a history of neurological or psychiatric disorder, or
disordered sleep. Subjects kept a 7-day sleep diary, and were
instructed to follow their regular sleep schedule, and refrain
from alcohol and caﬀeine at least 3 and 1 days, respectively,
prior to the experiment. Menstrual phase was not controlled
for in female subjects. All participants read and signed an
informed consent form, which described in detail the procedures and purposes of the study.
Subjects were instructed to arrive at the laboratory $1 h
prior to their usual bedtime, the latter calculated as a 7-day
bedtime average based on their sleep diaries. Each of them spent
one whole night in the laboratory, in an air-conditioned
soundproof temperature controlled dark Faraday-cage room
that was intentionally not monitored to avoid potential sleep
disturbances owing to the feeling of Ôbeing watchedÕ. No
pharmacological substance was used to induce sleep. Before
sleep, 2 min of recording was taking place, during which the
subjects were instructed to keep their eyes closed and relax.
Night sleep recording began after the subjects willingly switched
oﬀ the room lights, as were instructed to do when they would
feel like falling asleep, and ended with their spontaneous wake
up in the morning. Electrophysiological signals were monitored
in an adjacent room and overnight communication with the
subjects was established vocally through a microphone–speaker
console system. In the morning, all subjects reported to have
had a comfortable and undisturbed sleep.
Recording
All-night sleep was recorded using 58 EEG tin electrodes
according to the extended international 10–20 system (FP1,
FPZ, FP2, F3A, F4A, F7, F5, F3, F1, FZ, F2, F4, F6, F8, C5A,

P5, P3, P1, PZ, P2, P4, P6, T6, CB1, P3P, P1P, PZP, P2P, P4P,
CB2, O1, OZ, O2) using an electrode cap (ElectroCap International, Eaton, OH, USA), that provided inter-electrode spacing of $4.5 cm. EEG electrode inputs were ear lobe referenced
and grounded over the FZA position. A bipolar derivation of
oblique electrooculogram was used to detect eye movements,
for which electrodes were placed 1 cm above the right outer
cantus and 1 cm below the left outer cantus, and a bipolar
EMG from the upper masseter muscle was used to track
muscle tone changes. Impedance of all electrodes was kept
below 10 kOhms for most of the night. All electrophysiological

parameters were AC recorded, ampliﬁed at a total gain of
1000, band-pass ﬁltered at 0.05–500 Hz and digitized through
an 16-bit resolution A ⁄ D converter, which provided an
accuracy of 0.084 uV ⁄ LSB, at a sampling frequency of
2500 Hz by a Synamps system (Neuroscan, Charlotte, NC,
USA), and stored on hard disk. The 50-Hz notch ﬁlter was not
applied during recording. Subject movements during sleep
were detected by a sensitive motion detector placed over the
bed area that produced a 2-s Transistor-Transistor Logic
signal every time movement occurred. The motion detectorÕs
signal was recorded as an external trigger and was stored along
with the electrophysiological signals as an event channel.
Scoring and event selection
Sleep staging was performed by visual inspection according to
the standard criteria of Rechtschaﬀen and Kales (1968).
Scoring was further aided by the collation of a Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT)-based hypnospectrogram, that is, the wholenight FFT-based time–frequency plot for 0.05–45 Hz with a
step frequency of 0.05 Hz. Continuous scoring was performed
rather than epoch-based scoring to obtain a precise match
between the derived hypnogram and the hypnospectrogram
(Fig. 1). This was achieved by examining a 20-s EEG epoch
and marking on it any intra-epoch changes (stage transitions
or brief microarousals) with $1 s. Microarousals were scored
according to the guidelines of the ASDA Report (1992). Note
that the hypnogram was formed with a step of only 1 s. The
cumulative duration of microarousals was within normal limits
(Table 1), and much shorter than the graphics compression of
the hypnogram in Fig. 1 may imply.
In Table 2, we present the incidence and average peak
frequency values of the basic rhythms that were observed in
this study for every subject.
The KC was identiﬁed – based on standardized criteria of
the AASM Visual Scoring Task Force (2007) as well as those

of the DGSM Task Force (2006) – as a > 500-ms welldelineated negative sharp wave usually followed by a positive
phase that stands out of the EEG background (Fig. 2a,b). In
this study, singular (without another KC or slow-wave activity
immediately preceding or following) generalized (distinguishable in the EEG all across the midline electrodes) spontaneously occurring KCs from only NREM stage II periods of the
whole-night sleep of our subjects were selected. For the needs
of this particular study, KCs were further categorized as
KCXÀ X0 Xþ , where XÀ 2 f0; 1g and denotes the absence (0) or
existence (1) of a spindle interrupted by the KC, X0 2 f0; 1g
and denotes the absence (0) or existence (1) of an oscillation
during the negative phase of the KC, and Xþ 2 f0; 1gand
denotes the absence (0) or existence (1) of a spindle starting
during the descending negative and the positive phase of the
KC (see raw data images of Table 3). KCs immediately
preceding microarousals and awakenings during sleep, as well
as KCs followed by alpha or delta waves, were excluded from
this study.
The sleep spindle was identiﬁed as a > 500-ms train of
$11–16-Hz waves. In this study, two types of sleep spindles
were further identiﬁed as slow and fast spindles according to
the deﬁnitions of Gibbs and Gibbs (1964). Fast spindles
(>13 Hz) exhibit a symmetric bilateral distribution over
centro-parietal areas, while slow spindles (<13 Hz) exhibit a
similarly bilateral distribution frontally and are absent or
signiﬁcantly diminished in the centro-parietal and posterior
areas (Figs 3 and 4). All spindles, both slow and fast, were
selected from only NREM stage II periods of the whole-night
sleep of our subjects. Posterior alpha rhythm was derived from
the eyes-closed relaxed awareness presleep recording.
Analysis
Manual cursor marking oﬀered by Scan software (Neuroscan,
Charlotte, NC, USA) was used to create event channels.

NREM stage II epochs from the whole-night sleep recording
and free of any movement and other artifacts were selected,
and precise time-markers were placed over the events under
study. In total, four kinds of events were visually marked and
used for further analysis: (a) the peak of the negative phase of
the KC; (b) the peak of the positive phase of the KC (where
applicable); (c) the peak of the maximum in amplitude negative

wave of the fast spindle; and (d) the peak of the maximum in
amplitude negative wave of the slow spindle. For all markers,
the peak was marked over the record of the Cz electrode,
where fast spindles are prominent, except for the slow spindlesÕ
marker that was positioned over the record of the Fz electrode
where slow spindles stand out.
Event-related data were further processed by a custom-made
Matlab-based (The Mathworks, Natic, MA, USA) software
suite developed at the Neurophysiology Unit. FFT-based
event-related time–frequency analysis was performed for each
selected event within a time-window centered (time = 0.00) at
the marked event, from 0.05 to 20 Hz at a step of 0.05 Hz. In
particular, slow as well as fast spindles were analyzed in a timewindow of )1.00 to 1.00 s, the negative peak of the KC was
coarsely analyzed in a time-window of )2.00 to 2.00 s, and the
positive peak of the KC was analyzed in a time-window of
)0.50 to 0.50 s. Coarse analysis resulted in averaging of the
time–frequency plots (Fig. 2d) for all samples for each
category of events. Moreover, the EEG related to the negative
peak of the KC (time = 0.00) was ﬁnely FFT-based time–
frequency analyzed in three equal and symmetrical timewindows, the ﬁrst covering the time interval of )1.50 to 0.00 s,
the second )0.75 to 0.75 s, and the third 0.00–1.50 s. The ﬁne
analysis was performed for each of the marked samples in
order to obtain, from each of the three time intervals, the peak
frequency value, and the power spectral density (PSD) of the
KC-interrupted spindle, the oscillation within the KC, and the
post-KC spindle, respectively, where applicable depending on
the KC KCXÀ X0 Xþ type. PSD values appear as the dB

was calculated by epoching and FFT of the 2–3-min presleep
recording. Scalp mapping of the recorded data was performed
by the use of the Green-function-based multiquadric interpolation method described by Sandwell (1987), after baseline
correction of all channels. No ﬁlter was applied to the
processed electrophysiological data. All frequency and PSD
values were measured over the Cz electrode, unless otherwise
stated.
RESULTS
KCs
A total of 1131 KCs were accumulated from NREM stage II
periods in seven whole-night EEG recordings of six subjects
(one subject slept twice to control for the constancy of sleep
architecture and brain rhythm characteristics) using the
criteria described in section ÔMaterials and methodsÕ. The time
and space distribution as well as the frequency content of the
studied KCs were similar to the ones already described in
literature (Colrain, 2005; De Gennaro et al., 2000; Hala´sz,
200), that is, a more than 500-ms wave of signiﬁcant amplitude
($50–400 uV) with a prevalence of the negative peak over the
frontal areas (Fig. 2a–c). The positive peak of the KC samples
exhibited a dominant distribution over the central and anterior
parietal areas (Fig. 2b,c).

Sleep spindles
Individual spindles, that is, spindles not coinciding with KCs
or other prominent EEG features, in total 1601 (345 slow
spindles and 1256 fast spindles), were studied throughout all
NREM stage II epochs of the seven whole-night sleep
recordings. In conﬁrmation of the previously described
distinction (De Gennaro and Ferrara, 2003; Schabus et al.,
2007; Urakami, 2008), sleep spindles extracted from the sleep
recordings of this study were either slow (of mean frequency
12.02 ± 0.66 Hz and maximal distribution over the frontal
and prefrontal electrodes) or fast (of mean frequency
14.15 ± 0.84 Hz and maximal distribution over the central
and anterior-parietal electrodes), as can be seen in Figs 3 and
4. Notably, both slow and fast sleep spindles compared with
the EEG background were accompanied by a decrease in EEG
power at frequencies 2–4 Hz (see averaged spectral graphs of
Fig. 4).
Post-KC spindles are higher frequency spindles
Sleep spindles appeared right after the negative peak of KC
(reaching maximum within 1 s from the negative peak of the
KC, that is, during the late part of the negative and ⁄ or during
its positive phase) in 814 ⁄ 1131 (71.97%) of the times KCs were
observed. Although not precisely time-locked to the KC, we
will call these spindles Ôpost-KC spindlesÕ to distinguish them
from Ôsporadic spindlesÕ appearing at random times, without
being preceded or followed by KCs. Post-KC spindles had the

Exemplary EEG traces (top), average TFAs (middle) and frequency statistics (bottom). [The peak frequencies of the rhythms that concern this study, that is, pre-KC, the oscillation during the
negative phase of the KC (intra-KC) and the post-KC spindles appear clustered according to the type of KC. The last column shows the mean frequency values across subjects. The raw data
images show the KCXÀ X0 X þ categorization: X_ stands for the absence (0) or existence (1) of a spindle interrupted by the KC, X0 stands for the absence (0) or existence (1) of an oscillation during
the negative phase of the KC, and X+ stands for the absence (0) or existence (1) of a spindle triggered during the descending negative and positive phase of the KC. The spectral images [for
frequencies 0.05 Hz (top) to 20 Hz (bottom), for a time interval of ± 2 s from the negative peak of the KC] are taken from 179 KCs of the second night of Subject 4Õs sleep. In the last column, the
raw data and spectral images are both averages from the same subject. Values are means ± SD, unless otherwise indicated.

oscillating. In every case, the development of spindles was
interrupted by KCs. The observation of a complete stop in
100% of the cases and the shorter duration on average of these
spindles compared with the sporadic ones of the same subject
make a coincidental termination of spindles unlikely and allow
us to consider it as interruption. Of course, the terms

sleep spindle (Fig. 5b). By Ôintra-KC oscillationÕ we want to
note that we had no evidence of this oscillation before or after
the negative phase of the KC. It seems to characterize most
KCs (874 ⁄ 1131, Table 3: KC010, KC011, KC110 and KC111),
regardless of whether the KCs occur alone (532 ⁄ 708, Table 2:
KC010 and KC011) or during the development of fast spindles
(322 ⁄ 403, Table 2: KC110 and KC111). The probability of KCs
being followed by spindles does not seem to depend on
whether the KC is crowned by this short rhythmic oscillation

spindle. Per subject averaging of the KC111 time–frequency

by a short rhythm before a new spindle of higher frequency
appeared was observed globally on the scalp (Fig. 6). The
frequency of the post-KC spindles was found to be signiﬁcantly (P < 0.00001, paired t-test) higher than the frequency
of the fast pre-KC spindles.
The power relation between pre- and post-KC spindles was
also investigated. Table 4 shows the mean PSD values for
every subject that participated in this study, from which it is
clear that the average power relation of the pre- and post-KC
spindles varied across subjects. In two of our sleep recordings
(subjects 1 and 6), the power of post-KC spindles was higher
than the power of pre-KC spindles; in two (subjects 2 and 3)
the power of post-KC spindles was lower than the power of
pre-KC spindles; and in the rest of our recordings (subjects 4
and 5) the power of the two was kept at the same level (also see
Fig. 5, compare d–f).
Relationships between KCs, spindles, and related rhythms
To pursue these ﬁndings further, a table of rhythms (TOR) was
formed for each subject, denoting the peak frequency of each
characteristic brain oscillation and the diﬀerent types of

spindles were systematically categorized (Table 2). The posterior alpha rhythm, produced under conditions of relaxed
awareness, and the two types of sleep spindles are reported for
each subject. We added to the TOR the phenomena that are
the object of this study, that is, the peak frequencies of the preKC spindles, of the rhythmic oscillation appearing during the
negative phase of the KC, and of the post-KC spindles, derived
from all the accumulated KCs. It is worth noting the relatively
consistent frequency means of the above-mentioned rhythms
for subject 4 whose sleep was recorded twice. Presenting data
from each subject in this TOR reveal that the hereby-described
small but robust and consistent eﬀects of KCs can be detected
in spite of relatively larger diﬀerences of the mean values in
each subject (i.e. fast spindles frequency range from 12.65 to
15.10 Hz).
From the TOR, it can also be noted that: (a) the frequency
of the posterior alpha rhythm is always lower than that of the
slow sporadic spindles; (b) the frequency of the intra-KC
oscillation appearing during the negative phase of the KC is
always lower than the frequency of both the posterior alpha
rhythm and slow spindles; (c) the pre-KC spindles are in
congruence with sporadic fast spindles; (d) the frequency of the
Ó 2010 European Sleep Research Society, J. Sleep Res., 20, 57–72

Human NREM stage II K-complexes and spindles
post-KC spindles is always higher than the frequency of both
fast sporadic and pre-KC spindles. In addition, note the
signiﬁcantly higher proportion of KCs followed by spindles
(814 ⁄ 1131, 71.97%) in comparison with KCs preceded by
spindles (402 ⁄ 1131, 35.54%).
The relations between the investigated rhythms are schematically depicted in the diagrams of Fig. 7. Fig. 7a–c shows a
robust relationship between the frequency of sporadic fast
spindles, pre-KC spindles and post-KC spindles, for each of
the seven sleep recordings. As Fig. 7b shows, subjects with
relatively higher frequency of sporadic spindles also had
relatively higher frequency post-KC spindles. More speciﬁcally, not only is it shown that the higher the frequency of the
sporadic fast spindles (and thereby the frequency of the preKC spindles) the higher the frequency of the post-KC spindles,
but also that the amount of mean frequency increase is
consistent (thus creating the balanced oﬀset of the regression
line) irrespective of the mean frequency of the pre-KC spindles.
Fig. 7d shows that the latter robustness does not apply
amongst slow and fast spindles. In Fig. 7e, the intra-subject
pre-KC versus post-KC spindles relationship is shown for all
seven sleep recordings. Thus, the ability of spindles oscillating
at a higher frequency after the KC is not only shown as a mean
diﬀerence between evoked and spontaneous fast spindles, but
is also observed in each and every one of the 238 cases of
individual KCs preceded by spindles and followed by new
ones.
As can be noted in Fig. 7a and Table 2, the frequency of fast
spindles tends to characterize subjects, that is, it seems to vary
more between than within subjects; the span of the mean
frequency for each subject (from 12.65 Hz in subject
5–15.10 Hz in subject 4Õs ﬁrst night and 14.90 Hz second
night) is greater than 2 SD in each subject. For this reason, we
compared all parameters of this study in each subject as well as
in total, and graphically displayed results for each individual
subject. The mean results of comparisons reported have been
similarly observed in each and every subject with regards to
frequency of spindles (Table 2), but not with regards to their
power (Table 4).
To investigate the frequency increase of post-KC spindles in
more detail, we separated the pre-KC spindles of every subject
into two groups; the ﬁrst group comprising of pre-KC spindles
of frequency that fall below the mean fast spindle frequency
(lower frequency group), and the second group of those that
exceed the mean (higher frequency group) of each subject. The
analysis showed that the post-KC spindles following the lower
frequency group exhibited a signiﬁcantly higher (P < 0.005,

t-test)

increase
(1.60 ± 0.68 Hz,
11.33 ± 3.31%) than those that followed the higher frequency
group (0.74 ± 0.22 Hz, 5.24 ± 1.55%). Thus, we concluded
that interruption of lower frequency fast spindles is associated
with a higher frequency increase post-KC than the interruption
of higher frequency fast spindles. The latter adheres to the
existence of a ceiling in spindle frequency increase (and thereby
spindle frequency), which is diﬀerent for each individual
subject.

We believed to determine whether the phenomenon of the
higher frequency of post-KC spindles had some speciﬁc
relationship to KC features, and we categorized the selected
KCs according to several criteria. First, we clustered KCs
according to the KCXÀ X0 Xþ type, as can be seen from the
indicative images of Table 3. For each KC type, the mean
frequency of the pre-KC spindles, the KC oscillation of the
negative phase and the post-KC spindles were once more
calculated, as shown in Table 3. By focusing on the four KC
types that are related to post-KC spindles (KC001, KC011,
KC101, and KC111), one can easily see that the higher post-KC
spindle frequency is a common feature. More speciﬁcally, postKC spindle frequency values were higher by an average of
1.21 ± 0.10 Hz (8.70 ± 0.71%) with respect to those of the
respective pre-KC spindles, regardless of the fact that the
majority of the accumulated KCs (KC001 + KC011 = 577,
51.01%) were not preceded by spindles but, on the contrary,
they were followed by them. When KCs occurred after the
appearance of fast spindles (403 ⁄ 1131, 35.63%), spindles
invariably (100%) stopped for at least the duration of the
rising phase of the KC and were replaced (322 ⁄ 403, 79.9%) by
a lower frequency short rhythm of $ 8.82 ± 1.20 Hz (see raw
data of Fig. 5b, and spectral data of Fig. 5c,d). Following this
and during the falling phase of their negative phase, a new
spindle sequence was evoked in 238 ⁄ 403, 59.05% of the cases.
This is a signiﬁcantly (P = 0.0009, paired t-test for the seven
sleep recordings) smaller percentage compared with the total
cases of KCs that are followed by spindles (815 ⁄ 1131,
72.06%). Apparently, the precedence of spindles decreases
the probability of new spindles following the KC (from
72.06% to 59.05%). Hence, there was no case of a spindle
running uninterrupted during a KC. Only 21.04% of the total
KCs (Table 3, KC101 and KC111, total 238 ⁄ 1131) were both
preceded and followed by spindles, and in every one of these
cases the spindle following was of higher frequency than the
one preceding, so it is most likely to be a diﬀerent event.
Then, aiming to explore a potential dependency of the
described eﬀects on the shape or on a particular phase of the
KC, we clustered KCs according to their distinguished
recorded features, that is, the amplitude of the negative and
the positive peak. For each of the abovementioned features, we
ranked all accumulated KCs per subject. Then we selected the
highest and lowest 25% of the ranked KCs from every subject,
waveform-averaged and performed time–frequency analysis on
them, as shown in Fig. 8a–d. In all cases, the elevation of postKC spindle frequency was evident. The mean frequency
increase in the 25% of KCs with high negative phase peak
for all subjects was 0.95 ± 0.25 Hz, in the 25% of KCs with
low negative phase peak was 1.01 ± 0.22 Hz, in the 25% of
KCs with high positive peak was 0.93 ± 0.16 Hz, and in the
25% of KCs with low positive phase was 1.00 ± 0.62 Hz. To
complement the results, we selected from every subject all KCs
whose positive phase was hardly distinguishable and therefore
was not marked according to section ÔMaterials and methodsÕ
(Fig. 8e). Even when the positive phase was virtually absent,
the post-KC spindles had an average frequency increase of

hardly distinguishable positive phase (n = 21). The blue and red vertical lines mark the negative and positive peaks of KCs, respectively. None of
these KC features pertains to the generation of higher frequency post-KC spindles (or to the blockage of coinciding pre-KC spindles). All data
shown were derived from the clustering of 139 KCs from subject 6.

0.84 ± 0.20 Hz. In addition note that amplitude sorting of
both the negative and the positive KC phase (even when the
latter is hardly distinguishable) showed that the topographical
characteristics did not vary consistently with the KC recorded
size (see averages of waveform and topography of Fig. 8).
Finally, we investigated whether the occurrence of post-KC
spindles is aﬀected by the occurrence of the distinctive positive
phase of the KC. From all subjects, we grouped 811 ⁄ 1131
(71.71%) KCs with prominent positive phase, and 320 ⁄ 1131
(28.29%) with hardly distinguishable positive phase. Of the
former group, post-KC spindles occurred at a relatively high
proportion of 74.10% (601 ⁄ 811), and in the latter group at an
also high and comparable proportion of 66.56% (213 ⁄ 320). It
therefore appears that the higher frequency of post-KC
spindles is not related to the size or the relative prominence
of the KCÕs positive phase.
DISCUSSION
Detailed analysis of spontaneous singular and generalized KCs
occurring during NREM stage II of whole-night undisturbed
sleep resulted in three main observations: (a) the sleep spindle
is blocked upon accidentally coinciding KC; (b) during the
blockage, an intra-KC oscillation appears instead; and (c) the
spindles appearing with high probability after the negative
peak of the KC – not time-locked to the KC – have a
signiﬁcantly higher frequency than both pre-KC fast spindles
as well as sporadic, non-KC-related, fast spindles. The latter
increase in spindle frequency was highly correlated to the mean
frequency of both the pre-KC spindles and the sporadic fast
spindles (Fig. 7), while it seemed to be by a maximum
frequency. For every subject all spindle frequencies (sporadic
slow and fast, pre- and post-KC spindles) are kept within
relatively narrow individual ranges, despite the relatively wider
inter-subject variation. Spindle power did not necessarily
increase after the KC. Clustering all selected KCs according
to the above observations showed that all related combinations (KC001, KC011, KC101, and KC111) exhibited in the
immediate post-KC period a similar statistically signiﬁcant
increase in spindle incidence and spectral frequency. The same
happened with clusters of KCs with relatively higher or lower
amplitude of their negative or positive phases, or even KCs
without a positive phase. Finally, the probability of KCs being
followed by spindles does not seem to depend on whether the
KC is crowned by the short oscillation at $ 8.8 Hz or not
(72% in both). Overall, we found no KC feature that could
predict either the spectral frequency increase or the incidence
of spindles following the KC better than any others. In all
categories, higher frequency spindles occurred after the passing
of the KC at a similarly high level of probability. It should be
noticed that all conclusions of this study are limited to
the prominent type of KCs peaked by unblinded sampling
but according to the strict criteria fully described in
section ÔMaterials and methodsÕ; they may not necessarily
generalize to all KCs appearing in other sleep stages besides
NREM stage II.

In spite of the evidence for independence of spindles from
KCs (reviewed in section ÔIntroductionÕ), the most frequent
clustering of the two graphoelements in the timeframe of the
Cyclic Alternating Pattern (Terzano et al., 1985) is impressive.
It is often stated that spindles Ôride on KCsÕ or Ôconstitute a
part of the KCÕ (Blum and Rutkove, 2007). In addition, the
positive phases of KCs are associated to population burst
discharges in layer 5 and 6 pyramidal neurons, which project
to the thalamus (Amzica and Steriade, 1998). Such a strong
corticothalamic input could possibly discharge reticular
nucleus (RE) neurons and thereby trigger spindles (Buzsaki,
2006). We have clariﬁed and quantiﬁed this tendency to
coincide in time, showing that ongoing spindles stop upon KCs
for their duration and a new spindle usually appears at the
half-second interval following the completion of the negative
component of a KC. This study strongly supports the
independence of spindles incidence from a preceding KC by
means of distinguishing, presenting and analyzing separately
all the possible combinations of sequential events ⁄ rhythms
appearance in association to the KC (KC000–KC111, Table 3),
despite the fact that some combinations appear more often
than others. If KCs and spindles were not independent
phenomena of sleep, at least one of the four combinations
(that is, KC0X0, KC0X1, KC1X0 and KC1X1) would be obsolete.
However, this independence of incidence concerns the generation mechanisms of the KC and the sleep spindle. We have
shown in this study that when the two phenomena coincide,
there is a clear interaction between the two.
Sleep spindles rhythm is initiated in c-aminobutyric acidergic thalamic RE neurons, which impose onto TC neurons
rhythmic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, thus de-inactivating a low-threshold Ca2 + current, which promotes burst
ﬁring. This is transferred to the cortex where it induces
rhythmic excitatory postsynaptic potentials, the electrical
generators of the EEG spindles. Cortical excitation on both
RE and TC neurons helps synchronize, spread and maintain
the spindle rhythm (Buzsaki, 2006; Steriade and McCarley,
2005). The fact that the ongoing spindling activity is invariably, abruptly and completely blocked upon KC coincidence,
the higher spectral frequency and the high incidence of
spindles after the negative phase of the KCs are all phenomena
that could be understood in the context of the down–up states
of the slow frequency (<1 Hz) cortical oscillation, where the
succession of down and up states reﬂects a hyperpolarizing–
depolarizing sequence (Amzica and Steriade, 1998; Cash et al.,
2009; Steriade et al., 1993). To the extent that we currently
understand the mechanisms of bistability of neocortical
networks, it can be surmised that the slow oscillation is an
emergent network property of neocortical neurons (Buzsaki,
2006). Scalp-recorded KCs are considered to reﬂect the
neuronal synchrony associated with the down–up depolarization shift (Amzica and Steriade, 1998), and the up state
triggers spindles. The fast transition from silence to population activity represents a self-organized criticality, the very
nature of which may allow subcortical stimuli (sensory or
homeostatic) to interrupt and reverse either the down or up

70

V. Kokkinos and G. K. Kostopoulos

state. It is therefore conceivable that in our KC1XX types
(Table 3) an up state carrying spontaneously occurring spindles was interrupted by an endogenous arousal stimulus,
which in turn induced a new down–up shift carrying a KC,
and often a new spindle. The higher frequency of the new
spindle can then be attributed to a depolarization of TC
neurons, which facilitates their rebound ﬁring a few milliseconds earlier than before. In turn, this depolarization of TC
neurons could be attributed to either an enhanced corticothalamic input at the beginning of the up state or by the
subcortical input that brought about the down–up shift in the
ﬁrst place.
Although both cortical and subcortical eﬀects on the
thalamus are possible, we consider the later as better explaining our data, as: (a) RE neurons produce spindles only when a
dampening of brainstem activity allows it and that in arousal
spindles are blocked when inputs from the brainstem and basal
forebrain hyperpolarize and so decouple the synaptic networks
of RE (Steriade and McCarley, 2005); (b) KCs may be
considered as a complex sleep-protecting reaction to arousing
stimuli in the frame of a highly dynamic balance between
hypnagogic and arousing tendencies in NREM stage II
(Hala´sz, 2005). It is therefore conceivable that a brief arousing
stimulus may trigger a KC and at the same time block spindles
by a brainstem inhibitory action at the RE level, upon the
depolarizing rebound of which a new spindle rhythm of higher
frequency is produced. This explanation would be compatible
with both the observed higher frequency of spindles occurring
immediately after a KC (in each subject faster than the fast and
never slow) and the high probability of the post-KC appearing
sleep spindles, yet none of the latter correlating with a
particular feature of the KC.
Another ﬁnding that requires explanation is the appearance
during the negative peak of the KC of a short-lasting rhythm
of a narrow frequency range (8.88 ± 1.20 Hz). It seems to
characterize most KCs, regardless of whether the KCs occur
alone (75%) or they occur during the development of fast
spindles (80%). Although TC neurons have the ability to
produce oscillations in the theta ⁄ alpha frequency (Hughes and
Crunelli, 2007), these rhythms are not a particular feature of
stage II NREM sleep, but rather characterize arousals and
partially NREM stage I. While human SWS rhythmic activity
in the 12–15-Hz spindle frequency range becomes grouped
during the slow oscillations, theta (4–8 Hz) and alpha (8–
13 Hz) band activities do not display such dynamics (Mo¨lle
et al., 2002). The short oscillation we observed during KCs,
which appeared to cover a narrow range at the border of these
two rhythms, may therefore not relate to either of them.
Moreover, we showed (Table 2) that this intra-KC oscillation
always had lower frequency than the posterior alpha. Its
appearance was not correlated with the appearance of spindles
either before or after the KC (Table 3). To our knowledge, this
short rhythm has not been observed with other sleep slow
waves, like delta. Along with the interaction of the KC with
spindles, the revealing of an oscillation riding on the KC
negative phase supports the view that the KC is a complex

multifaceted phenomenon, whose secrets are still unveiled
seven decades after its ﬁrst description.
Our data enhance the impression that fast and slow spindles
are distinct features of stage II sleep. We conﬁrm (Anderer
et al., 2001; Gibbs and Gibbs, 1964; Himanen et al., 2002;
Zeitlhofer et al., 1997; Zygierewicz et al., 1999) the frontal
predominance and slower frequency compared with the
centro-parietal predominance and faster frequency, as well as
the relatively higher incidence of the fast spindles (De Gennaro
and Ferrara, 2003). In addition, their respective mean spectral
frequencies do not appear to co-vary in individual subjects
(Fig. 7d). Most crucially, the spindles following KCs were
never of the slow type, but actually faster than the fast ones
observed in each and every subject.
It is not yet known whether the diﬀerent characteristics of
slow spindles are due to diﬀerent TC circuits (Anderer et al.,
2001) and ⁄ or longer hyperpolarization of TC neurons. More
frontal slow spindles are found in the ﬁrst sleep cycle when
sleep pressure is assumed to be highest and hyperpolarization
of their generators is considered to be deepest (Himanen et al.,
2002). Sleep pressure is determined both by homeostatic and
circadian factors (Borbe´ly, 1982), and it is diﬃcult to decipher
their inﬂuence on spindles frequency. Also, our data were
pooled from all sleep cycles and we certainly had many very
fast spindles in the ﬁrst cycle of sleep. However, if fast spindles
are postulated to occur in instances of relatively lighter sleep
compared with the slow ones, the even faster spindles we found
to follow KCs may indicate that following the KC there is a
short window of time (0.5–2 s) of even lighter sleep than before
the KC. This would be in line with the proposed arousing
stimulus as a more likely explanation of all the eﬀects we
observed.
The frequency variation of sleep spindles provides a handle
to the study of TC pacing mechanisms, and our ﬁnding of even
faster spindles following KC calls for a multidimensional
approach that would consider brain location and sleep
macrostructure (sleep stages and cycles) as well as microstructure (interaction between concurrent events). Such an
approach would help further understand the two roles so far
recognized for spindles: the gating of information processing
and thus protecting the sleeper from disturbing stimuli
(Buzsaki, 2006); and participation in oﬀ-line learning (Gais
et al., 2002). Spontaneous spindles or TC stimuli in the spindle
frequency have been shown to induce sustained depolarization
of cortical neurons, enhancement of cortical excitability lasting
several minutes and Ca2 + entry in the dendrites (Steriade and
McCarley, 2005). All these eﬀects are frequency dependent,
and learning a visuomotor task has been linked to an increase
of fast rather than slow spindles in the cortical areas involved
in the learning (Tamaki et al., 2009). Therefore, the observation of even higher frequency spindles could be relevant to
brain plasticity and memory consolidation mechanisms.
Finally, in the realm of pathophysiology, TC mechanisms
elaborating sleep spindles have been implicated in the development of EEG spike and wave discharges underlying absence
seizures (evidence reviewed in Kostopoulos, 2000). A gating

function in these discharges has been alternatively ascribed to
KCs (Amzica and Steriade, 2002; Hala´sz, 2005). Some
information on combining the above hypotheses to explain
absence seizures may be given by the observed eﬀects of KCs
on spindles.

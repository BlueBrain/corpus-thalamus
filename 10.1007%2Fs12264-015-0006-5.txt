Abstract Rebound depolarization (RD) is a response to
the offset from hyperpolarization of the neuronal membrane potential and is an important mechanism for the
synaptic processing of inhibitory signals. In the present
study, we characterized RD in neurons of the rat medial
geniculate body (MGB), a nucleus of the auditory thalamus, using whole-cell patch-clamp and brain slices. RD
was proportional in strength to the duration and magnitude
of the hyperpolarization; was effectively blocked by
Ni2? or Mibefradil; and was depressed when the resting
membrane potential was hyperpolarized by blocking
hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN)
channels with ZD7288 or by activating G-protein-gated
inwardly-rectifying K? (GIRK) channels with baclofen.
Our results demonstrated that RD in MGB neurons, which
is carried by T-type Ca2? channels, is critically regulated
by HCN channels and likely by GIRK channels.

Introduction
Neuronal rebound depolarization (RD) is a voltage
response to the offset from hyperpolarization of the
membrane potential [1, 2] and often results in the firing of
action potentials when sufficiently robust. RD can be
evoked by inhibitory synaptic stimuli in vivo [3] or
hyperpolarizing current injection in vitro [4, 5]. In the
central auditory system, RD has been recorded in the
inferior colliculus [6], superior paraolivary nucleus [7, 8],
thalamic reticular nucleus [9] and medial geniculate body
(MGB) [10, 11]. RD has important functional implications
in auditory information-processing. In the superior
paraolivary nucleus, RD is known to be involved in
encoding sound rhythms [7]. In the inferior colliculus, RD
has been proposed to play an important role in encoding
features of sounds, including duration and temporal
selectivity [12, 13].
The MGB is an important nucleus of the auditory thalamus. In the rat MGB, 99% of the neurons are glutamatergic [14, 15] and receive inhibitory inputs mainly from
the inferior colliculus and the thalamic reticular nucleus
[16–20]. The inhibitory inputs are distributed across the
dorsal and ventral parts of the MGB and evoke inhibitory
postsynaptic potentials [16, 21] which can hyperpolarize an
MGB neuron sufficiently to produce a robust RD [22–24].
Although RD is a prominent feature of MGB neurons [4,
5], its detailed physiological characteristics have not been
described. The purpose of the present study was to

characterize RD using the whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique in brain slices.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Wistar rats (aged 15–22 days, male or female) were used. All
procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee at the University of Science and Technology of
China. Slices containing the MGB were prepared using a
procedure similar to that described previously [21, 25].
Briefly, the rat was decapitated and the brain was rapidly
removed and submerged in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal
fluid (ACSF) containing (in mmol/L) 129 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.2
KH2PO4, 1.3 MgSO4, 20 NaHCO3, 2.4 CaCl2, 3 HEPES, and
10 D-glucose at pH 7.3–7.4 (osmolarity: 300–310 mOsm/
kg). The ACSF was continuously bubbled with 95% O2 and
5% CO2. The caudal portion of the cerebrum, embracing the
right and left hemispheres, was separated by two coronal cuts
in the midbrain and the forebrain. The brain was sectioned in
the horizontal plane into 300-lm slices using a vibrating
microtome (DTK-1000, Dosaka, Kyoto, Japan). The slices
were immersed in oxygenated ACSF in a holding chamber
for at least 1 h at 28 °C before electrophysiological
recording.
Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Recording
Slices containing the MGB were transferred from the holding chamber to a recording chamber (TC-344B, Middlesex
County, MA), in which oxygenated ACSF at 34 °C was
circulated at 3 mL/min. MGB neurons were visualized under
an upright microscope (FN1; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped
with a digital CCD camera using a 409 water-immersion
objective (FN1, Nikon) and infrared-differential interference

optics (Fig. 1B). For whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we
used an HEKA EPC-9 amplifier and PatchMaster software
(HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht (Pfalz), Germany). Signals
were filtered at 2.9 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Electrodes
for whole-cell patch-clamp recording were prepared
from borosilicate capillaries with a two-stage vertical puller
(PC-10, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). The electrode was filled
with internal solution containing (in mmol/L): 130 K-gluconate, 2 MgCl2, 5 KCl, 0.6 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP,
and 0.3 Na-GTP. The pH was adjusted to 7.2–7.4 with KOH
(1 mol/L) and the osmolarity was 280–300 mOsm/kg. The
resistance of patch electrodes was 4–6 MX. The liquid
junction potential was calculated at *15 mV and was not
corrected. RD was evoked by a hyperpolarizing step current
in current-clamp recording mode. Unless otherwise indicated, tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 lmol/L) was added to the bath to
eliminate rebound spikes and facilitate the measurement of
RD properties. The location of neurons under recording
relative to MGB divisions was visually identified by referring to the Paxinos and Watson atlas (4th edition).
Pharmacology
Mibefradil was prepared at a stock concentration of
3 mmol/L and stored at -20 °C. It was used within
3 months and diluted to a final concentration from 3 to
10 lmol/L on use. When NiCl2 (100 lmol/L) was applied,
KH2PO4 was not added to the ACSF to prevent precipitation. BaCl2 (100 mmol/L), NiCl2 (100 mmol/L), baclofen
(3 mmol/L), Tertiapin-Q (200 lmol/L), TTX (1 mmol/L),
and 4-ethylphenylamino-1,2-dimethyl-6-methylaminopyrimidinium chloride (ZD7288; 50 mmol/L) were prepared
as stock solutions (91000) and diluted in ACSF on use. All
drugs were from Sigma-Aldrich Inc., (St. Louis, MO),
except TTX (Hebei Aquatic Science and Technology
Development Co., Qinhuangdao, China) and Tertiapin-Q
(Tocris Cookson, Bristol, UK).

Data Analysis
Quantitative characterization of the RD properties amplitude, area, peak latency, and rise slope was similar to that
described previously (Fig. 1C) [6, 7]. The RD amplitude
was defined as the peak voltage over the resting membrane
potential and the latency as the time from the release of
hyperpolarization to the peak of RD. All the amplitudes over
the resting membrane potential were defined as the RD area
(Fig. 1C). The rise slope of the RD was measured between
10% and 90% of the peak amplitude. All analyses and figures were made using Clampfit 10.0 (Axon, Sunnyvale, CA)
and OriginPro 8.0 (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA). All data
are presented as mean ± SE. Student’s t test (paired, onetailed) was used for analysis of the effects of adjusting the
resting membrane potential. One-way or two-way repeated
measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction was used to analyze differences within
groups. If two-way RM-ANOVA resulted in a significant
main effect or a significant interaction, a one-way RMANOVA with Bonferroni correction was performed for
pairwise comparisons. P \ 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Pearson’s correlation was used to determine
whether the correlation between RD properties and another
variable was significant.

certain range. With a hyperpolarizing current 205 ms in
duration, the normalized RD amplitude gradually increased
from 54.71 ± 15.08% to 96.78 ± 2.64% (Pearson:
r = -0.79, n = 18, P \ 0.01) and the normalized RD area
from 48.45 ± 10.91% to 85.53 ± 3.01% (Pearson:
r = -0.74, n = 18, P \ 0.01) as the current magnitude
increased from -40 to -300 pA (Fig. 3A, C, and E). In
contrast, the normalized RD latency decreased from
274.60 ± 26.37% to 123.87 ± 7.51% (Pearson: r = 0.61,
n = 18, P \ 0.01) (Fig. 3A, C, and E). When the injected
current was -40 pA, the normalized RD amplitude gradually increased from 3.57 ± 1.11% to 94.03 ± 6.35%
(Pearson: r = 0.91, n = 34, P \ 0.01) and the normalized
RD area from 0.10 ± 1.47% to 95.68 ± 11.13% (Pearson:
r = 0.92, n = 34, P \ 0.01) as the current duration
increased from 25 to 685 ms (Fig. 3B, D, and E). In contrast, the normalized RD latency decreased from
455.39 ± 61.00%
to
202.84 ± 14.23%
(Pearson:
r = -0.84, n = 34, P \ 0.01) (Fig. 3B, D, and E). However, the amplitude, area and latency reached a plateau
when the magnitude or duration of hyperpolarization was
large enough (Fig. 3C–E). Under these experimental conditions, most MGB neurons (76.43%) had RD with
amplitudes ranging from 25 to 35 mV (Fig. 2C).
RD Was Blocked by Ni21 or Mibefradil

Results
The Strength of RD was Proportional
to the Magnitude and Duration
of Hyperpolarization
The neurons from which we recorded were from the ventral
and dorsal parts of the MGB (elliptical region in Fig. 1A).
None of the neurons with a stable resting membrane potential
(Vrest; more negative than -52 mV) fired spontaneously.
There was no significant difference in the Vrest between neurons in the ventral and dorsal MGB (dorsal:
-59.06 ± 0.56 mV, n = 36; ventral: -58.41 ± 0.74 mV,
n = 22, P [ 0.05), which is consistent with the findings of
Bartlett and Smith [5]. Action potentials were evoked by a
robust RD (Fig. 2A). In most cases, an MGB neuron exhibited
various patterns of rebound discharge ranging from a single
spike to complex firing following strong hyperpolarization
(Fig. 2A). These spikes were eliminated by 1 lmol/L TTX
and only five neurons (3.18%, 5/157 cells) in the presence of
TTX still showed a rebound spike, which was presumably a
high-threshold activated Ca2? spike (Fig. 2B) [10].
We quantitatively characterized RD in response to
hyperpolarizing currents of various magnitudes and durations and found that the strength of RD was proportional to
the magnitude and duration of hyperpolarization within a

123

To confirm the ionic basis of RD in MGB neurons, we
tested the actions of Ni2? and Mibefradil, blockers of lowvoltage-activated (T-type) Ca2? channels. Ni2? almost
eliminated RD as shown by the dramatic drop in RD
amplitude (29.24 ± 1.04 vs 3.68 ± 0.67 mV, n = 10,
P \ 0.01), the drop in RD area (2.23 ± 0.17 vs
0.49 ± 0.12 mV*s, n = 10, P \ 0.01) and the increase in
RD latency (80.55 ± 8.32 vs 286.77 ± 33.12 ms, n = 10,
P \ 0.01) following its application (Fig. 4A, B).
Mibefradil, a specific blocker of T-type Ca2? channels,
had a similar inhibitory effect on RD as shown by the drop in
amplitude (30.24 ± 1.06 vs 6.22 ± 1.03 mV, n = 16,
P \ 0.01) and area (2.96 ± 0.21 vs 0.69 ± 0.10 mV*s,
n = 16, P \ 0.01), and the increase in latency
(143.76 ± 14.17 vs 283.86 ± 29.66 ms, n = 16, P \ 0.01)
following its application (Fig. 4C, D). The blocking effects
of Ni2? and Mibefradil indicated that the RD in MGB
neurons is carried by T-type Ca2? channels.
RD Was Depressed by ZD7288
We showed that 50 lmol/L ZD7288 blocked the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN)
channels in MGB neurons (Fig. S1). The blockade of HCN
channels depressed the RD (Fig. 5A). With a hyperpolarizing current at -80 pA, ZD7288 decreased the RD

amplitude from 97.41 ± 1.10% to 48.60 ± 9.53% (P \
0.01), decreased the area from 94.21 ± 1.52% to 56.29 ±
11.14% (P \ 0.01), decreased the rise slope from
104.21 ± 5.75% to 63.29 ± 13.66% (P \ 0.05), and
increased the latency to the peak from 108.71 ± 1.80% to
361.35 ± 45.91% (P \ 0.01) (n = 25, Fig. 5B).
The blockade of HCN channels also hyperpolarized the
Vrest (-57.92 ± 0.71 vs -63.38 ± 1.03 mV, n = 25, P \
0.01) (Fig. 5D) and increased the input resistance
(372.94 ± 20.05 vs 435.15 ± 30.86 MX, n = 25, P \
0.05) (Figs. 5E and S2A). Because the ZD7288-induced
depression of the RD was significantly correlated with the
ZD7288-induced hyperpolarization of Vrest (Fig. S3A–C),
we investigated whether RD was suppressed by the
hyperpolarized Vrest. We found that the regulatory effects
of ZD7288 on RD properties (except the latency) were
reversed when the otherwise hyperpolarized membrane
potential by ZD7288 was adjusted back to the control level
by injecting positive current (Fig. 5A, C). Our data indicated that HCN channels regulate RD properties mainly
through changing the Vrest.

(Fig. 6D) and increased the input resistance from
394.94 ± 29.95 to 466.04 ± 50.33 MX (n = 18, P \
0.01) (Figs. 6E and S3B) in MGB neurons. Since RD was
sensitive to the Vrest (Fig. 5C), we then investigated the role
of Kir channels in the regulation of RD.
We found that blockade of Kir channels by Ba2? significantly changed the properties of RD in MGB neurons
(Fig. 6A and B). With a hyperpolarizing current at -80
pA, application of Ba2? decreased the amplitude (98.29 ±
1.49% vs 90.45 ± 1.72%, P \ 0.01) and the latency to the
peak (106.14 ± 1.38% vs 81.11 ± 3.10%, P \ 0.01), but
increased the area (93.47 ± 3.07% vs 106.71 ± 4.55%,
P \ 0.05) and the rise slope (92.02 ± 2.26% vs 203.37 ±
23.67%, P \ 0.01) (n = 27, Fig. 6B). Moreover, the area,
rise slope and latency of RD were significantly correlated
with Ba2?-induced depolarization of the Vrest (Fig. S4A–
C).
We found that the regulatory effects of Ba2? on the
amplitude and rise slope of RD were reversed if the
otherwise depolarized membrane potential was adjusted
back to the control level by injecting a negative current
(Fig. 6A, C). However, the area and the latency to the peak
of RD did not fully recover when the membrane potential
was adjusted back to the control level.

RD Was Regulated by Ba21
Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels play an
important role in maintaining the normal Vrest of neurons
[26]. Ba2? at micromolar concentrations is a relatively
specific blocker of Kir channels [27, 28]. We found that
100 lmol/L Ba2? depolarized the Vrest from
-58.66 ± 0.62 to -54.12 ± 0.66 mV (n = 31, P \ 0.01)

Activation of G-Protein-Gated Kir Channels
Depressed the RD
We then investigated the role of G-protein-gated Kir
(GIRK) channels, a subfamily of Kir channels, in RD. The

c-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB) receptor, which is
expressed abundantly in MGB neurons [26, 29], activates
GIRK channels through the intracellular G-protein pathway
[30]. We found that the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen
drastically depressed RD (Fig. 7). With a hyperpolarizing
current at -120 pA, baclofen decreased the amplitude
(96.73 ± 1.22% vs 10.68 ± 5.75%, P \ 0.01), the area
(93.87 ± 4.41% vs 7.53 ± 3.21%, P \ 0.01) and the rise
slope (94.34 ± 4.23% vs 8.46 ± 3.86%, P \ 0.01).
Baclofen also increased the latency to peak
(104.88 ± 1.61% vs 361.45 ± 52.48%, P \ 0.01)
(n = 10, Fig. 7B). These effects were reversed to a large
extent by Tertiapin-Q (200 nmol/L), a GIRK channel
blocker, indicating that the activation of GIRK channels
depresses RD (Fig. 7).

Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that RD in the MGB
is robust and is carried by T-type Ca2? channels (Figs. 2,
4). The magnitude, time course, and kinetics of RD were
proportional in strength to the magnitude and duration of
hyperpolarization (Fig. 3). Novel findings are that HCN
channels (Fig. 5), and likely GIRK channels (Fig. 7), regulate RD mainly by changing the Vrest.

blocked by Ni2? or Mibefradil, blockers of T-type Ca2?
channels (Fig. 4). This finding is consistent with previous
studies in other brain areas, including the hippocampus
[31], inferior colliculus [6], cerebellum [32, 33], and
superior paraolivary nucleus [7, 8]. The detailed mechanism underlying RD generation is associated with the
unique kinetics of T-type Ca2? channels (Fig. 8). When an
MGB neuron is at the Vrest, a large portion of T-type Ca2?
channels are in an inactivated state [34–36]. When a neuron is conditioned by a hyperpolarizing current, these
channels are de-inactivated and ready for activation. Following the offset of hyperpolarization, the recovery of the
membrane potential from the hyperpolarized state to the
resting state activates T-type Ca2? channels to cause a
depolarizing overshoot above the Vrest, namely RD.
The characteristic profiles of RD in the MGB are shaped
by the kinetics, expression, and development of T-type
Ca2? channels. First, a hyperpolarizing current with a
longer duration and larger magnitude de-inactivated more
T-type Ca2? channels. As a result, the RD was proportional
to the duration and magnitude of the hyperpolarizing current (Fig. 3). Second, RD was robust with a mean amplitude
of 29.81 mV and an area of 2.68 mV*s in the presence of
2.4 mmol/L extracellular Ca2? (Fig. 4C, D). At this Ca2?
concentration, the membrane potential can be brought
to about -40 mV, which is sufficient to induce rebound
spikes. The robustness of RD could partly be attributed to
the high density of expression of T-type Ca2? channels in
the soma and dendrites of thalamic relay neurons [37–39].
Third, RD can be recorded in most MGB neurons in young
animals (P15–22). The prevalence of RD is in agreement

Fig. 8 Schematic showing how HCN channels and Kir channels
mediate RD. Activation of HCN channels allows influx and activation
of Kir channels (including GIRK channels) allows efflux of cations,
which results in a depolarized or hyperpolarized membrane potential
(Vrest). When Vrest is normal or depolarized, T-type Ca2? channels are
inactivated and are de-inactivated by a hyperpolarizing current. The

HCN Channels Regulate RD Mainly by Changing
the Resting Membrane Potential
HCN channels have a high level of distribution in different
types of neurons in the MGB [42, 43]. Because of masking
interference from Kir channels, we seldom recorded the sag
phenomenon in MGB neurons. Our data demonstrated that
HCN channels play an important role in the generation of
RD in MGB neurons, which is consistent with previous
studies in other brain regions, such as the hippocampus and
superior paraolivary nucleus [7, 31]. We further showed
that HCN channels regulate RD by changing the Vrest,
because blockade of these channels hyperpolarized the Vrest
to depress RD (Fig. 5C).
The increase in membrane resistance by blocking HCN
channels (Fig. 5E) enhanced the efficiency of the hyperpolarization. Although more T-type Ca2? channels were
de-inactivated when the HCN channels were blocked, the
hyperpolarization of the Vrest (offset of hyperpolarization)
impeded the activation of T-type Ca2? channels (Fig. 8).
Besides the effects of the hyperpolarized Vrest, the
increased input resistance did not induce a significant
facilitation of RD (Fig. 5C), indicating that the increase in
input resistance has little effect on RD under our
conditions.
It is worth noting that there is an interaction between
HCN channels and T-type Ca2? channels. Activation of

offset of the hyperpolarization activates T-type Ca2? channels to
generate RD. When the Vrest is hyperpolarized, T-type Ca2? channels
are de-inactivated. The channels remain de-inactivated in the
presence of and following offset of the hyperpolarizing current and
RD is thus depressed. Dashed horizontal line indicates normal Vrest.

HCN channels depolarizes the membrane potential to
facilitate the activation of T-type Ca2? channels. In turn,
the increase of intracellular Ca2? induced by T-Ca2?
channels can increase the level of the cyclic adenosine
monophosphate to upregulate the activation of HCN
channels [44, 45]. This interaction plays a physiological
role in the generation of burst firing in single thalamocortical neurons and the oscillatory activity of neuronal networks in the thalamus [45–50].

Kir Channels Regulate RD by Changing the Resting
Membrane Potential
We showed that Kir channels play an important role in
maintaining the membrane potential in MGB neurons
(Fig. 6D), which is consistent with previous studies [11,
51]. We suggest that the activation of Kir channels regulates
RD by both hyperpolarizing the Vrest and decreasing the
input resistance in MGB neurons. Our results showed that
blockade of Kir channels by Ba2? depolarized the Vrest and
relatively facilitated the RD in MGB neurons (Fig. 6B).
Adjusting the depolarized Vrest to the control level did not
completely recover the increased RD, indicating that the
increased membrane resistance was also involved in the
facilitation of RD in MGB neurons (Fig. 6C). Increased
input resistance de-inactivated more T-type Ca2? channels
and the depolarized Vrest activated more of them, which
manifested as a facilitation of the RD (Fig. 8).
There is a high level of expression of GIRK channels,
which are one of the subfamilies of Kir channels, in MGB
neurons [52–54]. Activation of GIRK channels using the
GABAB receptor agonist baclofen suppressed RD
(Fig. 7). Since the GABAB receptor is a G proteincoupled receptor, its activation by baclofen triggers a
cascade of signals targeting a number of downstream
receptors or channels, including the GIRK channel. Our
results showed that the inhibitory effects of baclofen on
RD were not completely reversed by blocking GIRK
channels (Fig. 7B), suggesting that the activation of
GIRK channels contributes to the suppression of RD but
there are other possibilities. For example, GABAB
receptors may mediate cyclic adenosine monophosphate
synthesis to reduce the HCN current [55].
In light of the role of GIRK channels in modulating RD
properties, other factors that regulate the activity of GIRK
channels may also affect RD. Studies have shown that
acidification, intracellular phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and the concentration of Na? and Mg2? directly
influence the activation of GIRK channels [56–58].
Neurotransmitters,
such
as
acetylcholine
and
5-hydroxytryptamine, may modulate RD by activating
GIRK channels [59, 60].

Functional Implications of RD in the MGB
RD, as a particular form of the postsynaptic membrane
potential response to inhibitory presynaptic inputs, can
transform inhibitory synaptic inputs into excitatory outputs.
The MGB plays an important role in gating the transmission of auditory information [3, 61–63] and one of the
obligatory functions of MGB neurons is integrating excitatory and inhibitory signals from the inferior colliculus
and auditory cortex [19, 64, 65]. Thus, RD is important for
MGB neurons to integrate information. Moreover, RD
causes a strong Ca2? influx, which gates a series of
downstream Ca2?-dependent activities [66, 67], such as the
activation of Ca2?-activated K? channels.
As noted above, a robust RD means activation of
abundant T-type Ca2? channels, which can depolarize the
membrane potential. Sufficient depolarization activates
voltage-dependent Na? channels and is expressed as
rebound burst firing. RD and rebound burst firing in MGB
neurons are involved in the relay and processing auditory
information. First, burst firing acts as an effective relay and
amplifying signal in vivo [68–71]. Burst firing performs
better signal detection [70, 72], effectively relays auditory
information in a non-linear input–output manner, regulates
the frequency selectivity of MGB neurons [70, 73, 74], and
may be involved in the generation of oscillations [75, 76].
Second, RD and rebound spikes may be directly responsible for neuronal off-responses [8, 77, 78], which are
shown by MGB neurons [79, 80]. Although the physiological implications of off-responses are unknown, they
may be associated with the direction of motion of a sound
source, gap detection, and the temporal integration of
duration information [8, 81, 82]. Thus, the regulatory
mechanism of RD in the present study may provide a hint
as to how intracellular signals modulate neuronal information processing in MGB neurons.

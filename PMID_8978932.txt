ABSTRACT: The present study evaluated the occurrence, distribution, and number of GABAergic neurons in the thalamus of
different mammalian apecies (bat, mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit,
cat, monkey, humans), by means of light microscopical immunoenzymatic localization of GABA or of its biosynthetic enzyme
glutamic acid decarboxylase and by ultrastructural immunogold
detection of GABA. Our data demonstrated that: 1) GABAergic
local circuit neurons were detected in the thalamic visual domain in all the species analyzed, whereas in other thalamic nuclei their presence and number varied among species; 2) the
number of GABAergic local circuit neurons progressively increased in the dorsal thalamus of species W-th more complex
behavior; 3) the presence of local circuit neurons conferred a
similar intrinsic organization to the dorsal thalamic nuclei, characterized by complex synaptic arrangements; 4) in the reticular
thalamic nucleus, whose neurons were GABA-immunoreactive
in all the examined species, the cellular density decreased from
the bat to humans. Theae findings strongly suggest that thaIamic GABAergic local circuit neurons are not directly related to
the ability to perform specific sensorimotor tasks, but they are
likely to reflect an increasing complexity of the local information
processing that occurs at thalamic level. Copyright @ 1997

a relatively short distance from the parent cell body within the
boundaries of the thalamic nucleus of origin, and dendritic
shafts, and appendages that contain synaptic vesicles. The morphological distinction between these two cell types has been
confirmed in the thalamus by combined electrophysiological
and morphologicrd studies using intracellular injections of dyes
[1,12,35,37,52,62,63 ]. These studies confirmed the hypothesis
that the two types of thalamic neurons have different and selective electrophysiological properties [47,59]. Further studies
based on imrnunocytochemical methods demonstrated that projection neurons in the dorsal thalamus use an excitatory amino
acid as a neurotransmitter [47,48], while local circuit neurons
use the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-atninobutyrric acid
(GABA) [3,10,18,39,46,51,55]. All the electrophysiological
and neuroanatotnical data are, therefore, in accordance in demonstrating that the projection neurons provide an excitatory output and the local circuit neurons are the main source of intrathalamic inhibition. Ultrastructural studies provided evidence
that the presence of GABAergic local circuit neurons adds complexity to the synaptology and circuitry of the thalamus and,
therefore, to its functional properties [19,44,45,55].
Local circuit neurons are not the only elements devoted to
inhibition in the dorsal thalamus: the GABAergic neurons of the
reticular thalamic nucleus (Rt), an embryological derivative of
the ventral thalamus, also project to the dorsal thalamic nuclei in
all mammalian species [13,14,18,23,27,54].
GABAergic local circuit neurons, however, are not present
in all the thalamic nuclei of different mammalian species: they
are very numerous in almost all the dorsal thalamic nuclei of
primates and carnivores, but are virtually absent in rodents,
with the exception of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LG)
[2,3,14,15,50]
The discrepancy among different species regarding the occurrence, distribution, and number of GABAergic thalamic local
circuit neurons raises the question as to whether they could be
considered a marker of thalamic complexity. The hypothesis that
local circuit neurons increase in number in parallel with the complexity of the mammalian brain was originally formulated by
Cajal [4,5] and followed by other authors [16,42]. More recently, Penny et al. [39,40] studied the distribution and quantity
of GABAergic local circuit neurons in the thalamus of four spe-

INTRODUCTION
The dorsal thalarnus contains two morphologically and functionally distinct classes of neurons: the relay neurons, which
project outside the thalamus, and the local circuit neurons,
whose axons do not leave the thalamic nucleus in which they
reside. The distinction between the two types of thalarnic neurons was introduced by Marchi in 1887 [26], who described
for the first time short-axoned neurons, named Golgi type II
cells, and long-axoned neurons, named Golgi type I cells, and
was then established by Cajal [4,5]. Golgi type I or projection
neurons are characterized by a large- or medium-sized perikaryon and an axon that does not give out collateral branches
within the thalamus, whereas Golgi type II or local circuit neurons have a small perikaryon with an axon largely ramifying at

cies of mammals: opossum (a marsupial), rabbit (a lagomorph),
cat (a carnivore), and galago (a prosimian), and readapted the
hypothesis originally formulated by Cajal.
The aim of this work was to reevaluate the occurrence and
distribution of GABAergic neurons in the dorsal thalamus and
Rt in selected species representative of the mammalian phylogenetic tree. Data obtained by immunocytochemical experiments
using an antiserum against GABA or against its biosynthetic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were complemented
with similar data reported in the literature regarding other species
representative of different phyla. In addition, we evaluated the
relationship between the ceII density in Rt and the occurrence of
local circuit neurons in the dorsal thalamic nuclei. The immunocytochemical study was complemented by ultrastructural data.
Although a reevaluation of mammalian taxonomy is still in
progress, the phylogenetic tree reported in Fig. 1 reflects the current opinion on this issue [11,33]. In this regard it is worth mentioning that a report based on molecular biology data recently
questioned the classification of the guinea pig as a rodent and
suggested that it represents a separate evolutionary lineage from
myomorph rodents, such as the rat and mouse [11]. The occurrence of GABAergic local circuit neurons in the ventrobasal
complex (VB ) of guinea pig, and the consequent complex synaptic organization of this nucleus [55] support this hypothesis.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Different mammals were used for this study: bat (n = 2),
mouse (n = 2), rat (Wistar, n = 4), guinea pig (n = 3), and
rabbit (n = 1). Under deep anesthesia (chloral hydrate 4~o; 1
ml/ 100 g body weight) all animals were intracardially perfused
with a solution of saline followed by either a mixed solution of
2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 (PB ) or with a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in PB for GABA or GAD immunolocalization, respectively. The brains were cut, using an Oxford Vibratome, in 50
pm-thick coronal or horizontal sections. Data from the cat and
cynomolgous monkey were obtained from material prepared for
previous studies [3,51]. For GABA immunocytochemistry
(ICC), serial akernate sections through the rostrocaudal extent
of the thalamus were preincubated for 1 h in phosphate-buffered
saline pH 7.6 (PBS), containing 107. normal goat serum (NGS)
and 0.2% Triton X-1OO, incubated overnight in a rabbit polyclonal anti-GABA serum (Sigma) diluted 1:10,000 in PBS containing 19. NGS and 0.27. Triton X-100. After repeatedly rinsing
in PBS, the sections were incubated for 1 h in biotinylated goat
antirabbit IgGs (Vector) diluted 1:200 in PBS with IYo NGS,
rinsed in PBS, and incubated for 1 h in avidin–peroxidase complex (ABC kit, Vector) diluted 1:100 in PBS. After rinsing in
PBS and in 0.05 M Tns-HCl buffer (pH 7.6), sections were
reacted in a fresh solution of 0.05’70diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB, Sigma) and 0.002% H*O2in Tris-HCl for 5–
10 rein, washed in Tris-HCl buffer, and then mounted on gelatincoated slides, dehydrated, and coverslipped.
For GAD ICC, sections were processed as described above,
using a preincubation in 10Yonormal rabbit serum (NRS) with
0.2Y0 Triton X-1OO and an overnight incubation with a sheep
polyclonal anti-GAD serum (kindly provided by Dr. D. Schmechel, Duke University, Durham, NC) diluted 1:1000 in PBS with
1% NRS and 0.2% Triton X-1OO.After rinses in PBS and 1 h
incubation in biotinylated rabbit antisheep IgGs, the reaction was
detected using the avidin–biotin–peroxidase protocol and DAB
as chromogen.
Two human brains, obtained from patients, who died at the
Istituto Nazionale Neurologico “C. Besta” for diseases, not in-

volving the central nervous system, were also analyzed. Brains
were fixed by immersion in a 11’?ZO
formalin solution after autopsies performed 24–36 h postmortem. CoronaI sections of the
human thalami were then processed for the immunolocalization
of GAD following the previously described protocol.
Controls for the specificity of the immunolabeling were carried out on sections incubated with rabbit nonimmune serum for
GABA ICC and with sheep nonimmune serum for GAD ICC.
The substitution of primary antiserum with preimmune serum
abolished the immunoreactivity. Sections adjacent to those processed for ICC were counterstained with 1’ZO
thionin and used for
the cytoarchitectonic study.
Neurons positive for GAD or GABA immunostaining will be
referred to as GABAergic cells [53]. The distribution of GABAor GAD-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the thalamus of different
animals was charted using an X-Y plotting computerized system
connected to the microscope stage by means of transducers. The
cytoarchitectonic boundaries of the thalamic nuclei were identified on the adjacent thionin-stained sections and drawn on the
charts by means of a projection microscope.
After charting, the immunoreacted sections were lightly counterstained with thionin to enable recognition and measuring of
labeled and unlabeled cells.
A quantitative evaluation of the number of GABA-ir or GADir neurons was performed on sample sections of different animals, by counting with a 40x objective only labeled and unlabeled neurons with the nucleolus in the plane of the section. The
areas of both GABAergic and unlabeled neurons showing the
nucleolus in the plane of sections were calculated by means of
an appropriate imaging computer program (Immagini e Computer, Milan, Italy).
In each animal species four parameters were considered: 1)
percentage of GABAergic neurons in different thalamic nuclei;
2) GABAergic/non GABAergic neurons size ratio: this parameter was obtained by dividing the mean area of immunostained
cells by the mean area of unlabeled neurons. Only the ratio between the area of labeled and unlabeled cells was reported to
minimize the error due to the different procedures. Measurements
were made according to the procedure followed by Penny et al.
[40] to compare our experiments with those reported in this previous study. Data concerning this parameter in the human thalamus are not reported, because it appeared that the shrinkage of
thalamic projection neurons was more pronounced than that of
GAD-ir cells, presumably due to the fixation by immersion. 3)
Rt/thalamus ratio: this parameter was obtained by dividing the
area of the Rt by the area of the dorsal thalamus at different
rostrocaudal levels, and expressed as a percentage. The measurements of the dorsal thalamic and Rt areas were made on projection drawings of unreacted thionin-stained sections, sampled at
different levels of the anteroposterior extent of the thalamus. The
sections were selected so that a similar level, based on cytoarchitectonic recognition of the thalamic nuclei, was analyzed in
all the animals. 4) Neuronal density within the reticular thalamic
nucleus: this parameter was evaluated by plotting and counting
cells within the boundaries of the anteroposterior extent of Rt, in
immunoreacted and thionin-stained sections, sampled at three
levels (rostral, intermediate, and caudal pole) through the nucleus. The neuronal density (Nd) was evaluated as a ratio between the mean area of Rt (mARt) and the mean number of
counted cells in the nucleus (mNc), and expressed as Nd =
mARt/mNc.

then observed and photographed with a Jeol T8 or Zeiss 902
electron microscope. Controls for postembedding immunolabeling were performed as previously described [55]. The background labeling was very low, so that no statistical analysis of
the distribution of gold particles for the identification of labeled
profiles had to be performed.
RESULTS
In the following description of the distribution of GABAergic
neurons in the dorsal thalamus, we used the term medial geniculate mucleus (MG) to indicate both the magnocellular and parvocellular parts, lateral geniculate nucleus (LG) to indicate both
the ventraf and dorsal parts, and ventrobasal complex (VB ) to
indicate both the ventroposterolateral and ventroposteromedial
nuclei.

Virtually all the Rt neurons were labeled with the anti-GAD
serum (Fig. 2A). In the dorsaf thalamus, including the MG, only
few scattered GABAergic neurons (less than 1%) were present,
but in the LG, 20’7.of the neurons were immunopositive for GAD
(Figs. 3A and 4).
Immunostained puncta, interpreted as axon terminals, were
observed throughout the dorsal thalamus. The morphology and
size of GAD-ir and of unlabeled cells were similar, as shown by
the finding that the ratio between the areas of GABAergic neu-

rons and the areas of projection neurons (GABAlnonGABA ratio) was 0.85 (Fig. 5).
The Rt/ThaIamus ratio was 10.3770 and the cellular density
in Rt was 1157 neurons/mm2 (Figs. 6 and 7A).
Rat and Mouse
All the Rt neurons were stained with the GABA or GAD
antisera in the rat and mouse (Figs. 2B and 8A). The distribution
of GABAergic neurons in the dorsal thalamus was similar in both
animal species and the highest proportion of GABAergic neurons
outside the Rt was observed in the LG, where GABA-positive
neurons accounted for 15–2.(Mo of the total neuronal population
(Figs. 3B and 4). GABAergic neurons were less than 1% in the
other thalamic relays and in the intralaminar nuclei (Fig. 8B ).
Stained puncta were present throughout the dorsal thalamus with
regionaI and internuclear differences similar to those previously
described [2,3,38].
The GABA/non-GABA ratio was close to 0.8 for both species (Fig. 5); the Rt/thalamus ratio was 10.12% in the rat and
10.31% in the mouse. The cellular density in Rt was 700 neurons/
mmz in the rat and 1087 neurons/mmz in the mouse, closer to
that of the bat than to that of the rat (Figs. 6 and 7B ).
Guinea Pig
The main concentration of GABA-ir cells was found within
Rt, where all the neurons of the nucleus were labeled (Fig. 8C).
In the dorsaf thalamus the highest proportion of GABA-ir neurons was found in the LG, where they represented 20T0 of the
total neuronaf population (Figs. 3C and 4). In VB, GABA-ir

neurons were also present, and these cells accounted for 14~oof
the total neuronal population (Figs. 4 and 8D). Only few scattered GABA-ir neurons (approximately 1%) were present in the
remaining dorsal thrdamic nuclei. The neuropil of these nuclei
was different from that observed in the VB and LG: large and
small GABA-ir puncta were found in the VB and LG, while the
other thalamic nuclei contained only small ir puncta [55].
The size of GABAergic cells was smaller than that of non
GABA-ir cells and the GABAlnon-GABA ratio was 0.53, lower
than that observed in the bat, mouse, and rat (Fig. 5). The Rt/
thalarnus ratio was 11.89%, with a cellular density in Rt of
435.11 cells/mm2 (Fig. 6).

Rabbit
All the neurons of the Rt were GAD-ir. In the dorsal thalamus,
the main concen~ation of GAD-ir neurons was found in the LG,
where they represented 25Y0 of the total neuronal population,
whereas only 18% of VB neurons were GAD-ir (Fig. 4). In all
the other dorsal thalamic nuclei GABAergic neurons accounted
for less than 1% of the neurons.
The GABAergic neurons represented a distinct class of small
cells, in agreement with the finding that the GABAlnon-GABA
ratio was 0.6 [40] (Fig. 5). The Rt/thalamus ratio was 11.98Y0,
with a cellular density in Rt of 246.26 cells/mm2 (Fig. 6).

Cat and Monkey
VirtuaIIy all the cells of Rt were labeled with GAD or GABA
antisera in both species (Fig. 2C and D). All the dorsal thalamic
nuclei displayed GABAergic neurons. In the sensory nuclei,
such as the VB and LG, and in the motor nuclei, such as the
ventral anterior (VA) and ventrolateral (VL) nuclei, labeled
neurons accounted for approximately 24–27Y0 and 27–33% of
the total neuronal population in the cat and monkey, respectively (Fig. 4). The neuropil staining varied considerably from
one nucleus to another, but no territory of the thalamus was
devoid of GABA-ir fibers and terminals as reported in previous
studies [3,15,22,30,50].
GABA-ir neurons in the various thakunic nuclei displayed a
remarkable degree of uniformity with regard to shape and size.
GABAergic cells were smaller than the unlabeled neurons, resulting in a GABAlnonGABA ratio of 0.5 and 0.4 in the cat and
monkey, respectively (Fig. 5). In the cat, the Rt/thalamus ratio
was 12.35~0 and a great decrease of the neuronal density in the
Rt (51.12 cells/mm2) was observed with respect to the previously
considered species (Figs. 6 and 7C). In the monkey, the Rt/
thalamus ratio was 8.2% and the neuronal density in the Rt was
39.7 cells/mm2, remarkably lower than in the other mammals
investigated in the present study (Figs. 6 and 7D).
Humans
Virtually all the Rt neurons were GAD-ir (Fig. 2E).
GABAergic neurons were present in all the dorsal thalamic
nuclei and th-eyrepresented 40?0 of the total neuronal population
in primary sensory relays and motor-related nuclei (Fig. 4).
As mentioned previously, although GAD-ir cells appeared
considerably smaller than projection neurons, the GABA/
nonGABA ratio was not evaluated because of the different
shrinkage of the two types of neurons, probably due to the fixation procedure.
The Rt/thalamus ratio was 10.72’7.,similar to that of the other
mammals investigated. The Rt neurons were very scattered
within the boundaries of the nucleus, so that the cellular density
in the Rt, 30.7 cells/mm2, was the lowest observed in all the
examined mammals (Fig. 6).

GABAergic neurons were detected in the LG nucleus of all
the mammalian species analyzed in the present study. Several
previous ukt-astructural investigations have shown that the synaptic organization of the LG is similar in different species due to
the presence of vesicle-containing dendritic appendages of GABAergic neurons [20,27–29,34,55].
In the present study, the ultrastructural analysis was performed only in the VB and Rt, where the light microscopic analysis showed interspecies differences regarding the presence and
density of GABAergic neurons.
In the Rt of the examined species (guinea pig, rat, and cat),
GABA labeling was found in cell bodies, dendrites, and presynaptic axonal terminals making symmetric synapses (Fig. 9A, C,
E, and F). OnIy in the cat Rt some of the GABA-ir vesiclecontaining profiles were postsynaptic to unlabeled asymmetric
terminals or to other GABA-ir profiles (Fig. 9E, F). The unlabeled terminals making asymmetric synapses were similar in the
rat, guinea pig, and cat.
On the contrary, the synaptic organization of VB was similar
in the guinea pig and cat, and it was more complex in these
species than in the rat. In the rat VB, GABA labeling was exclusively present in axonal terminals with heterogeneous size and
shape making single or multiple symmetric synapses on unlabeled cell bodies and dendrites (Fig. 9B). GABAergic terminals
of this kind were found also in the VB of the guinea pig and cat,
but in these species GABA labeling was also present in several
vesicle-containing dendrites engaged in complex synaptic arrangements, similar to those described in LG, with other GABAir profiles or with unlabeled terminals making asymmetric synapses and classifiable as SR (small, with round vesicles) or LR
(large with round vesicles) (Fig. 9D, G). In the rat VB, SR and
LR terminals were never presynaptic to vesicle-containing profiles (Fig. 9B).
DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates that the intrathalamic networks of different mammals were arranged through modifications in the number and distribution of GABAergic neurons.
In our experiments, the labeling observed with the anti-GABA
and with the anti-GAD sera were similar, in agreement with previous reports [40,53,61], and this rules out the possibility that
methodological problems could have influenced our findings.
The present data raise a number of questions on the basic
features of thalamic organization.
1. Are Thalamic Local Circuit Neurons Related to Functional
Specialization?
GABAergic neurons occur in the LG of ancestral mammals,
and their number in this nucleus increases in species where local
circuit neurons are present also in other dorsal thalamic nuclei.
Penny et al. [40] investigated the distribution of GABAergic
neurons in the thalamus of the opossum, a marsupial that originated in the early Mesozoic and belongs to an early stage of
mammalian evolution. The opossum is a nocturnal scavenger,
whose behavior is more associated with movement and smell
than with visual acuity, yet the only dorsal thalamic nucleus endowed with a significant number of GABAergic neurons was the
LG. In the bat, a placental chiropter and nocturnal flying echolocating animal, in agreement with the data reported by Wirier et
al. [61], we found that 20Y0of the neurons of the rudimental LG
were GABAergic, whereas the comparatively large MG lacked
GABAergic neurons. Also in the rat and mouse, 20% of neurons

in LG were GABAergic, despite the rudimental visual system of
these nocturnal rodents. Conversely, VB, which is essential for
the vibnssal specialization of nocturnal rodents, was found to
lack GABAergic neurons, consistently with previously published
data [2,6,38,54]. These findings point out a dissociation between
the behavioral needs of these animals and the occurrence of GABAergic cells in the LG, and strongly suggest that thalamic local
circuit neurons are not directly related to the ability to perform
specific sensorimotor tasks.
Moreover, in the rabbit, guinea pig, cat, monkey, and humans
GABAergic neurons are present also in other thalamic relay nuclei besides the LG. In the thalamus of the rabbit, a lagomorph
that appeared in the Paleocene, prior to the origin of carnivores
and prosirnians, as well as in that of the guinea pig, GABAergic
neurons were detected only in VB [40,55]. On the other hand,
in carnivores (cat) and primates (monkey, man) GABAergic
neurons increase in number and become widely distributed in all
the dorsal thalamic nuclei [3,10,13,15,21,22,25,30–32,39,44–
46,50,5 1]. The ultrastructural organization of the nuclei containing GABAergic neurons differs from that of the nuclei devoid of
local circuit neurons (see below), and it is likely to reflect an
increasing complexity of the local information processing that
occurs at thalamic level.
Finally, in ancestral species cell bodies were uniform in size,
while in recent mammals GABAergic cells were smaller than
projection neurons [40].

2. Does the Thalamic Synaptic Arrangement Rejlect the
Presence of Local Circuit Neurons?
As mentioned previously, the synaptic organization of the
LG (the thalamic nucleus that consistently contains GABAergic neurons in mammals) is known to be very similar in
different animal species [20,27–29,34]. Also, in the VB the
synaptic organization was similar in all the species endowed
with GABAergic neurons, such as the guinea pig, cat, and
monkey [36,45,55 ] and much more complex than that of the
dorsal thalamic nuclei lacking GABAergic interneurons (e.g.,
VB of the rat [7], VL and the thalamic paraventricular nuclei
of the guinea pig [55]). In all the thalamic nuclei in which
they are present, GABAergic local circuit neurons typically
possess dendritic varicosities containing synaptic vesicles that
are engaged in complex synaptic arrangements [17,34,36,45].
These dendritic varicosities (also called presynaptic dendrites) can be presynaptic to conventional dendrites of relay
neurons and postsynaptic to GABA-negative axonal terminals
with asymmetric specialization, such as the LR terminals
(identified as ascending excitatory afferents, [7,8,45]) or the
SR terminals (identified as descending corticothalamic afferents, [7,45]) or to GABA-ir profiles [36]. A large proportion
of the contacts established by GABAergic local circuit neurons occurs, therefore, via presynaptic dendrites that have
been proposed to act as a separate synaptic unit [43]. In par-

neurons (asterisks) are surrounded by several GABA-positive puncta (arrows) in the VB of rat (B), whereas GABA-positive neurons (arrowheads) are present only in the VB of guinea pig (D). Scale bars: A = 20 #m; B = 50 #m; C and D = 100 #m.

ticular, GABAergic presynaptic dendrites are ideally placed
to mediate feed-forward inhibition because they are often involved in triadic synaptic arrangements with sensory afferents
(LR terminals) and thalamocortical relay cells [36].
On the basis of these major structural differences, it is reasonable to assume that the physiological properties of VB are
different in species containing GABAergic local circuit neurons
with respect to species lacking them.
3. 1s There a Relationship Between the GABAergic Rt Neurons
and the GABAergic Local Circuit Neurons in the Dorsal
Thalamus?
All the dorsal thahtmic nuclei of mammals receive inhibitory
inputs from the Rt. This nucleus, which contains a relatively ho-

mogeneous collection of GABAergic neurons, can be considered
the common system of GABAergic thalamic inhibition, as it is
present in all the mammals so far investigated, as well as in reptiles [41].
GABAergic terminals deriving from Rt neurons are morphologically similar in different thalamic nuclei and animal species
and are widely distributed on the cell bodies and dendrites of
dorsal thalamic neurons [7,23,36]. Furthermore, the activity of
Rt cells is believed to be coordinated within the nucleus through
the presence of local axon collaterals [54,63] and, at least in the
cat and monkey, through dendrodendritic synapses [9,60].
Rt receives a major input from collaterals of thalamocortical
and corticothalamic axons and it sends back an inhibitory input
to thalamic relay neurons. Because of these connections, Rt takes
part in a negative feed-back system that controls the transmission

of information from the thalamus to the cortex and may also play

a role in seIective attention [19,56,59]. Thus, the functional role
played by Rt is different from that played by GABAergic local
circuit neurons, which in the dorsal thalamic nuclei have been
implicated in mechanisms that modulate the quality, rather than
the quantity, of the information transmittedto the cortex [49].
Interestingly, although the ratio between the Rt area and the
area of the dorsal thalamus is fairly constant in all the species
examined in our study, we found a progressive decrease in the
ceIlular density of Rt from the bat to humans, that seemed to
parallel the numerical increase of intrathalamic GABAergic local
circuit neurons (Fig. 10). On this basis, it can be hypothesized
that, with the increase in the number of local circuit neurons in
the dorsal thalarnus, the Rt role becomes more focused in the
regulation of sleep–waking cycle, andJor in acting as internal
thalamic pacemaker, rather than in direct thalarnic inhibition
[56-58]. Alternatively, the decrease in the Rt cellular density
may simply be a consequence of the general increase in brain
volume in the examined species as it is not accompanied by a
variation in the morphology of Rt neurons [24].

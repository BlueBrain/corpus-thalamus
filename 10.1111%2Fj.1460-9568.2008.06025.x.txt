Abstract
The majority of studies investigating responses of thalamocortical neurons to tactile stimuli have focused on the whisker
representation of the rat thalamus: the ventral–posterior–medial nucleus (VPM). To test whether the basic properties of
thalamocortical responses to tactile stimuli could be extended to the entire ventrobasal complex, we recorded single neurons from the
whisker, forepaw and hindpaw thalamic representations. We performed a systematic analysis of responses to stereotyped tactile
stimuli ) 500 ms pulses (i.e. ON–OFF stimuli) or 1 ms pulses (i.e. impulsive stimuli) ) under two different anesthetics (pentobarbital
or urethane). We obtained the following main results: (i) the tuning of cells to ON vs. OFF stimuli displayed a gradient across neurons,
so that two-thirds of cells responded more to ON stimuli and one-third responded more to OFF stimuli; (ii) on average, response
magnitudes did not differ between ON and OFF stimuli, whereas latencies of response to OFF stimuli were a few milliseconds longer;
(iii) latencies of response to ON and OFF stimuli were highly correlated; (iv) responses to impulsive stimuli and ON stimuli showed a
strong correlation, whereas the relationship between the responses to impulsive stimuli and OFF stimuli was subtler; (v) unlike ON
responses, OFF responses did not decrease when stimuli were moved from the receptive field center to a close location in the
excitatory surround. We obtained the same results for hindpaw, forepaw and whisker neurons. Our results support the view of a
neurophysiologically homogeneous ventrobasal complex, in which OFF responses participate in the structure of the spatiotemporal
receptive field of thalamocortical neurons for tactile stimuli.

Introduction
The ventrobasal complex, which is composed of the ventral–
posterior–lateral nucleus (VPL) and ventral–posterior–medial nucleus
(VPM) of the thalamus, receives tactile information from the entire
surface of the body (Wall & Dubner, 1972; Welker, 1973). Tactile
stimuli produce excitatory inputs on thalamocortical neurons of the
ventrobasal complex through lemniscal projections (Andersen et al.,
1964) and indirect inhibitory inputs through the thalamic reticular
nucleus (Scheibel & Scheibel, 1966; Minderhoud, 1971; Houser et al.,
1980). The balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs therefore
shapes the responses of thalamocortical neurons to tactile stimuli.
The rat represents a particularly convenient animal model with
which to investigate the responses of thalamocortical neurons to tactile
stimuli. In fact, unlike that of other species, the rat ventrobasal
complex is composed only of purely sensory excitatory cells without
interneurons (Saporta & Kruger, 1977; Barbaresi et al., 1986; Harris &
Hendrickson, 1987). In addition, the rat trigeminal system offers an
elegant spatial paradigm, the whisker pad, for investigating thalamoCorrespondence: Dr J. Aguilar, as above.

cortical tactile responses. For this reason, the great majority of rat
studies have focused on the trigeminal thalamus, the VPM (CastroAlamancos, 2004). However, the extent to which the rat ventrobasal
complex can be considered anatomically and neurophysiologically
homogeneous (Emmers, 1965; Peschanski et al., 1984) is not
completely clear.
The principal aim of the present work was to compare thalamocortical responses to tactile stimuli across hindpaw neurons, forepaw
neurons and whisker neurons, recorded under two different anesthetics (urethane or pentobarbital). Previous studies have typically used
either impulsive stimuli, i.e. stimuli of short duration (£10 ms) that
produce a simple response (Armstrong-James & Callahan, 1991;
Friedberg et al., 1999; Canedo & Aguilar, 2000; Castro-Alamancos,
2002; Khatri et al., 2004; Aguilar & Castro-Alamancos, 2005; Hirata
et al., 2006; Higley & Contreras, 2007; Li & Ebner, 2007), or ON–
OFF stimuli, i.e. stimuli of longer duration (‡100 ms) that produce a
more complex response, called an ON–OFF response (Simons &
Carvell, 1989; Nicolelis et al., 1993; Kyriazi et al., 1994; Nicolelis &
Chapin, 1994; Ghazanfar et al., 2001; Brecht & Sakmann, 2002;
Bruno et al., 2003; Minnery et al., 2003; Timofeeva et al., 2003;
Temereanca & Simons, 2004). Relatively little attention has been
devoted to OFF responses (Kyriazi et al., 1994; Brecht & Sakmann,
2002; Minnery et al., 2003). Here we performed a systematic
comparison between ON responses, OFF responses and impulsive

Materials and methods
Animals and surgery
All animal experiments described here conformed to the International Council for Laboratory Animal Science, European Union
regulation 86 ⁄ 609 ⁄ EEC, and were approved by the Ethical
Committee for Animal Research of Hospital Nacional de Paraple´jicos (Toledo, Spain). Data were obtained from 13 male rats (250–
350 g). Animals were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital
(50 mg ⁄ kg) or with intraperitoneal urethane (1.5 g ⁄ kg). These
anesthetics were chosen because of their well-established use for
studying the receptive ﬁeld properties of thalamocortical neurons in
the rat. Once the anesthesia had taken complete effect, animals were
placed in a stereotaxic frame (SR-6R; Narishige Scientiﬁc Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). Lidocaine 2% was applied over body
surfaces in contact with the frame and over the area of the
incision. The skin of the head was softly removed from the top of
the skull, and a large craniotomy was performed on the right side of
the midline [AP ¼ 1 to )4; L ¼ 1–4; atlas of Paxinos & Watson
(1986)] in order to facilitate access to the somatosensory thalamus
(Fig. 1A). Small incisions were made in the dura mater to permit
the placement of recording electrodes into the brain. In order to
prepare the whiskers for stimulation, the whisker pad was cut at
1 cm from the skin. The temperature of animals was kept constant
at 36.5 °C with an automatically controlled heating pad.

Electrophysiology
Extracellular single-unit recordings were obtained from the rat
thalamus using tungsten electrodes with 4 MW impedance
(TM31C40KT of WPI, Inc., Sarasota, FL, USA). An additional
electrode was inserted in the somatosensory cortex for continuously
recording electroencephalograph signals, which were used to monitor
the effect of anesthesia (Fig. 1B). The level of anesthesia was kept
constant at stage III-3 (Friedberg et al., 1999) throughout the course of
the experiments by applying supplemental doses when required (1 ⁄ 4
of original doses for both anesthetics). The experiments were
performed under a predominant frequency of cortical electroencephalograph of 3–4Hz (Fig. 1B, bottom), which represents a less
synchronized state as compared to the deeper anesthesia levels
characterized by rhythmic bursts at lower frequencies (Fig. 1B, top). If
rhythmic bursts were detected during the experimental protocol, the
stimulation protocol was aborted. Stage III-3 is a rather stable state in
which thalamocortical neurons display relatively large (i.e. multiwhisker or multidigit) receptive ﬁelds. At deeper levels of anesthesia,
thalamocortical neurons display minimal receptive ﬁelds (e.g. only
one whisker), and therefore the neural responses lose much of their
spatiotemporal complexity (Friedberg et al., 1999). At lighter levels of
anesthesia, animals display spontaneous whisker movements, and
thalamocortical neurons increase the size of their receptive ﬁelds and
the spatiotemporal complexity of their responses (Friedberg et al.,
1999), which become maximal in activated states (Aguilar & CastroAlamancos, 2005) and in awake animals (Nicolelis & Chapin, 1994).
Stage III-3 therefore offers good experimental conditions for consistently recording neurons through long stimulation protocols and for
retaining at least part of the spatiotemporal complexity that characterizes the responses of thalamocortical neurons.

All recordings were ampliﬁed and ﬁltered (1 Hz to 3 kHz) using a
modular system composed of a preampliﬁer, ﬁlter and ampliﬁer
(Neurolog; Digitimer Ltd). Analog signals were converted into digital
data at a 20 kHz sampling rate and with 16-bit quantization using a
CED Power 1401 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK)
controlled by Spike2 software (v5.03; Cambridge Electronic Design).
Signals were stored in the hard disk of a PC for subsequent analysis.
Thalamic single-unit recordings were obtained from the VPM and
VPL (AP ¼ )2.3 to )4; L ¼ 2–4; D ¼ 5–7) (Fig. 1A). We studied
the responses to whisker stimulation for VPM neurons and responses
to cutaneous stimulation in forepaw or hindpaw for VPL neurons.
Each experiment consisted of one or two electrode tracks and between
one and three recording sites per track, depending on the time required
to isolate good neurons and to achieve the suitable physiological
conditions. Once a neuron was isolated, the ﬁrst step was to identify
the body region (whiskers, forepaw, or hindpaw) where a slight touch
with a paintbrush produced a consistent cellular response. The VPM is
located dorsal and medial in the somatosensory thalamus, and the VPL
is located just behind, more ventral and lateral, making a small curve
from lateral to medial around the VPM base (Fig. 1A). Moving down
the electrode into the somatosensory thalamus, it was possible to
isolate neurons with receptive ﬁelds located in the whiskers, in the
forepaw, and ﬁnally in the hindpaw (Emmers, 1965; Waite, 1973a;
Vahle-Hinz & Gottschaldt, 1983).
At the majority of recording sites (n ¼ 24 sites), only a single
neuron was isolated. The signal-to-noise ratio was veriﬁed to be >10,
considering the peak of the spike as signal and the standard deviation
of the background as noise. At some recording sites, it was possible to
isolate either two single neurons (n ¼ 7 sites) or three single neurons
(n ¼ 1 site). The signal-to-noise ratio was always >10 for the ﬁrst
neuron and >5 for secondary neurons (Fig. 1C). Discrimination
between neurons was meticulously achieved with off-line analysis,
using voltage threshold methods and spike-sorting protocols in a
complementary way, after digitally bandpass ﬁltering the signals
between 300 Hz and 3 kHz (Fig. 1C). Overall, we recorded and
discriminated a total of 41 well-isolated neurons. The quality of
single-neuron recordings was checked throughout the experiments in
order to keep the signal-to-noise ratio and the physiological conditions
as stable as possible. The total recording time for each single neuron
ranged between 1 h and 3 h.

Tactile stimulation
Once a neuron was isolated and classiﬁed as VPM, forepaw VPL or
hindpaw VPL, the protocols for tactile stimulation were applied. First,
we located the receptive ﬁeld center, deﬁned as the whisker or
cutaneous area that consistently elicited the response with greater
magnitude (number of spikes ⁄ stimulus) and shorter latency (Aguilar &
Castro-Alamancos, 2005). In all cells (n ¼ 41), we applied an
ON–OFF stimulation protocol, which consisted of a set of 100 stimuli
of 0.5 Hz frequency and 500 ms duration, delivered to the receptive
ﬁeld center of each cell. Whiskers were stimulated in their preferred
direction along the dorsal–ventral axis (Lee et al., 1994; Friedberg
et al., 1999). The dorsal–ventral preferred direction was empirically
estimated with a hand-held probe before the stimulation protocol.
In a subset of cells (n ¼ 32), we also applied a stimulation protocol
with impulsive stimuli, which consisted of a set of 100 stimuli of
0.5 Hz frequency and 1 ms duration, again delivered to the receptive
ﬁeld center of each cell. Thus, impulsive stimuli were delivered to the
same whisker or to the same cutaneous area used for ON–OFF stimuli
in each cell. Note that ON–OFF stimuli and impulsive stimuli

represent two extremes of the same stimulation pattern: trains of
square pulses with long pulse duration (500 ms) or with short pulse
duration (1 ms), respectively. In other words, an impulsive stimulus is
a very short ON–OFF stimulus.
In a further subset of cells (n ¼ 12), we also applied the ON–OFF
stimulation protocol to a responsive surround location, i.e. an adjacent
whisker or an adjacent digit.
All stimuli were generated using a Master8 electrical stimulator
(A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel) with an ISO-Flex stimulus isolator
(A.M.P.I.). Electrical pulses were delivered to a custom-made
piezoelectric sensor attached to a rigid tungsten bar (0.5 mm in
diameter, 2.5 cm long, with the tip curved at 90° for 5 mm). The
piezoelectric sensor transduces electrical pulses into mechanical
movements, whose range depends on the voltage. We used a voltage
of 90 V, which imposed a ﬁnal vertical movement of 0.5 mm to
the tungsten bar. The tungsten bar was situated manually under
microscopic control (Leica M300; Leica Microsystems) just a few
micrometers over, but never touching, the whisker or the cutaneous
area selected previously. Because even in deeply anesthetized
conditions thalamocortical neurons can consistently respond to
somatosensory stimuli at frequencies of 1 Hz (Castro-Alamancos,
2002; Aguilar & Castro-Alamancos, 2005), the frequency of 0.5 Hz
was conservatively chosen to avoid adaptation. The output of the
Master8 stimulator was sent to the CED Power 1401 and recorded in
Spike2 together with the signals in order to trigger the subsequent data
analysis.

Data analysis
Data analyses were based on two main measures extracted from the
peristimulus time histograms of single-neuron responses: the response
magnitude, calculated as the averaged number of spikes ⁄ stimulus,
and the response latency, calculated as the time interval between the
onset of the stimulus and the onset of the neural response. The
latency of OFF responses was calculated from the offset of the
stimulus pulse. Peristimulus time histograms were estimated with a
1 ms bin size. We also introduced a dimensionless index, ON–OFF
tuning, which is a magnitude index that quantiﬁes how much a cell is
tuned to ON stimuli as compared to OFF stimuli. It was deﬁned as
RMON ⁄ (RMON + RMOFF), where RMON indicates the magnitude of
response to ON stimuli and RMOFF indicates the magnitude of
response to OFF stimuli, both expressed in spikes ⁄ stimulus. Finally,
we estimated the spontaneous ﬁring rate of each neuron by averaging
the spikes per unit time in a 200 ms window before each ON
stimulus, before each OFF stimulus, and before each impulsive
stimulus, to compare the neurophysiological states of neurons and to
conﬁrm the stability of recordings across stimulation protocols. All
measures were exported to Matlab (version 6.5; The Mathworks) for
statistical analysis.

responses of neurons to ON–OFF stimuli and to impulsive stimuli.
First, we investigated whether the magnitudes of impulsive responses
were different from the magnitudes of ON responses or from the
summed magnitudes of ON responses and OFF responses, using
paired t-tests. Second, we veriﬁed the hypothesis of the magnitudes
and latencies of impulsive responses being correlated with the
magnitudes and latencies of ON responses and OFF responses, using
the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient. Finally, we tested whether the
ON–OFF tuning could be used to predict the preference of a neuron, in
terms of response magnitude, to ON stimuli as compared to impulsive
stimuli. To this end, we tested whether the ON–OFF tuning correlated
with the ratio between the magnitude of response to impulsive stimuli
and the magnitude of response to ON stimuli, again using the Pearson
correlation coefﬁcient.

Spatial structure of ON–OFF responses

We compared the responses to impulsive stimuli between neurons in
different representations of the ventrobasal complex (VPM, forepaw
VPL, hindpaw VPL) and between different anesthetics (pentobarbital
or urethane), using the same anova design previously described for
ON–OFF responses. We then performed three analyses to compare the

main factor was the anesthetic, with two levels: pentobarbital or
urethane.

Results
ON responses
We recorded a total of 41 well-discriminated single neurons from the
rat somatosensory thalamus responding to tactile stimuli. The
spontaneous ﬁring rate of neurons calculated immediately before
ON stimuli was 1.9 ± 2.8 Hz and was not signiﬁcantly different
(unpaired t-test, P ¼ 0.33) between neurons recorded under pentobarbital anesthesia (n ¼ 22) and neurons recorded under urethane
anesthesia (n ¼ 19). Almost all neurons (39 of 41) were excited by
ON stimuli (Fig. 2). Response magnitudes and latencies are reported
in Table 1. Response magnitudes were similar between hindpaw
neurons, forepaw neurons, and whisker neurons (anova, P ¼ 0.32),

but were greater in neurons recorded under pentobarbital anesthesia
(1.81 ± 0.89 spikes ⁄ stimulus) than in neurons recorded under urethane anesthesia (1.21 ± 0.52 spikes ⁄ stimulus; anova, P ¼ 0.0393).
Response latencies were shorter in whisker neurons than in forepaw
neurons, and shorter in forepaw neurons than in hindpaw neurons
(anova, P ¼ 0.00002), which is consistent with the expected
differences in the time required to reach the brainstem from the
different stimulation sites. Latencies of response to ON stimuli did not
differ between neurons recorded under pentobarbital anesthesia and
neurons recorded under urethane anesthesia (anova, P ¼ 0.89).

OFF responses
The spontaneous ﬁring rate of neurons calculated immediately before
OFF stimuli was 2.8 ± 3.2 Hz and was not signiﬁcantly different
between neurons recorded under pentobarbital anesthesia and neurons
recorded under urethane anesthesia (unpaired t-test, P ¼ 0.27). Most
neurons (32 of 39) were excited by OFF stimuli (Fig. 2). Response
magnitudes and latencies are reported in Table 1. Again, magnitudes
of response to OFF stimuli were similar between hindpaw neurons,
forepaw neurons, and whisker neurons (anova, P ¼ 0.99). Response
magnitudes tended to be greater in neurons recorded under pentobarbital anesthesia, but the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant
(anova, P ¼ 0.14). Similarly to the latencies of response to ON
stimuli, the latencies of response to OFF stimuli were shorter in
whisker neurons than in forepaw neurons, and shorter in forepaw
neurons than in hindpaw neurons (anova, P ¼ 0.00002). Latencies of
response to OFF stimuli tended to be longer under pentobarbital
anesthesia than under urethane anesthesia, but again, the difference did
not reach signiﬁcance (anova, P ¼ 0.0764).

ON–OFF tuning
Overall, 66% of neurons were tuned to ON stimuli, and the
remaining 33% of neurons (13 of 39) were tuned to OFF stimuli.
Importantly, we found neurons tuned to OFF stimuli across the
entire ventrobasal complex: ﬁve of 15 hindpaw neurons, four of 16
forepaw neurons, four of eight whisker neurons. Statistical analysis
showed that the ON–OFF tuning was distributed similarly across
neurons recorded under pentobarbital anesthesia (0.66 ± 0.26) as

than the total number of neurons because some neurons had identical latencies or magnitudes.

(r ¼ 0.95, P < 0.000001). The correlation between ON and OFF
latencies was consistent for hindpaw neurons (r ¼ 0.75, P ¼ 0.0046),
forepaw neurons (r ¼ 0.61, P ¼ 0.0271), and whisker neurons
(r ¼ 0.96, P ¼ 0.0006) (Fig. 3A).

Comparisons between ON responses and OFF responses
The spontaneous ﬁring rate calculated immediately before OFF stimuli
was signiﬁcantly greater than the spontaneous ﬁring rate calculated
immediately before ON stimuli (paired t-test, P ¼ 0.0025). When we
compared OFF responses to ON responses, response magnitudes were
not signiﬁcantly different between ON and OFF stimuli (paired t-test,
P ¼ 0.30), whereas latencies of response to OFF stimuli were
signiﬁcantly longer than those in response to ON stimuli (paired
t-test, P ¼ 0.00002) (Fig. 2), both under pentobarbital anesthesia
(paired t-test, P ¼ 0.0004) and under urethane anesthesia (paired
t-test, P ¼ 0.0035). The difference between the latency of OFF
responses and the latency of ON responses was more evident under
pentobarbital anesthesia (3.6 ± 2.8 ms) than under urethane anesthesia
(1.0 ± 1.1 ms; paired t-test, P ¼ 0.0158).
Magnitudes of response to OFF stimuli and to ON stimuli displayed
a weak but signiﬁcant correlation (Pearson, r ¼ 0.43, P ¼ 0.0138).
Latencies of response to OFF stimuli and to ON stimuli were strongly

Impulsive responses
In a subset of 32 neurons, we also studied the responses to impulsive
stimuli. All neurons responded to impulsive stimuli. Response
magnitudes and latencies are reported in Table 1. The analysis of
impulsive responses conﬁrmed the results obtained with ON
responses. Response magnitudes were similar between hindpaw
neurons, forepaw neurons, and whisker neurons (anova, P ¼ 0.23),
but were greater in neurons recorded under pentobarbital anesthesia
(1.71 ± 0.58 spikes ⁄ stimulus) than in neurons recorded under urethane anesthesia (1.23 ± 0.52 spikes ⁄ stimulus; anova, P ¼ 0.0316).
Response latencies were shorter in whisker neurons than in forepaw
neurons, and shorter in forepaw neurons than in hindpaw neurons
(anova, P < 0.00001). Response latencies did not differ between
neurons recorded under pentobarbital anesthesia and neurons recorded
under urethane anesthesia (anova, P ¼ 0.49).

responses
The spontaneous ﬁring rate calculated immediately before impulsive
stimuli was not different from the spontaneous ﬁring rate calculated
immediately before ON stimuli (paired t-test, P ¼ 0.96). The
comparison between impulsive responses and ON–OFF responses
revealed that the average magnitudes of response to impulsive stimuli
were much smaller than the sum of magnitudes of response to ON and
OFF stimuli (paired t-test, P < 0.00001), being instead remarkably
similar to the magnitudes of response to ON stimuli alone (paired
t-test, P ¼ 0.44). Indeed, magnitudes of response to impulsive stimuli
correlated well with the magnitudes of response to ON stimuli
(Pearson, r ¼ 0.76, P < 0.00001). This was true for hindpaw neurons
(r ¼ 0.91, P ¼ 0.00001), forepaw neurons (r ¼ 0.64, P ¼ 0.0342),
and whisker neurons (r ¼ 0.94, P ¼ 0.0006) (Fig. 3B). The tight
relationship between impulsive stimuli and ON stimuli was corroborated by the strong correlation between their response latencies
(Pearson, r ¼ 0.98, P < 0.00001). Again, this was true for hindpaw

neurons (r ¼ 0.94, P < 0.00001), forepaw neurons (r ¼ 0.93,
P ¼ 0.00004), and whisker neurons (r ¼ 0.93, P ¼ 0.0009)
(Fig. 3C).
Magnitudes of response to impulsive stimuli were also weakly
correlated with the magnitudes of response to OFF stimuli (Pearson,
r ¼ 0.37, P ¼ 0.0388), which revealed a more subtle relationship
between impulsive responses and OFF responses. We found that in six
of six neurons that did not respond to OFF stimuli (hindpaw n ¼ 3,
forepaw n ¼ 2, whisker n ¼ 1), the magnitudes of response to
impulsive stimuli were smaller than the magnitudes of response to ON
stimuli (Fig. 4A), with a difference of 0.62 ± 1.16 spikes ⁄ stimulus
(paired Wilcoxon, P ¼ 0.0313). Conversely, in all remaining neurons,
the magnitudes of response to impulsive stimuli were, on average,
slightly greater than the magnitudes of response to ON stimuli
(Fig. 4B), with a difference of 0.05 ± 0.20 spikes ⁄ stimulus (one-sided
paired t-test, P ¼ 0.0375). Overall, the ratio between the magnitude of
response to impulsive stimuli and the magnitude of response to ON
stimuli was negatively correlated with the ON–OFF tuning (Pearson,
r ¼ )0.47, P ¼ 0.0057). This means that neurons displaying few or

no OFF responses (ON–OFF tuning close to 1) responded more to ON
stimuli than to impulsive stimuli, whereas neurons displaying
predominant OFF responses (ON–OFF tuning closer to 0) responded
equally or even more to impulsive stimuli than to ON stimuli (Fig. 4).

Spatial structure of ON–OFF responses
In a subset of cells (hindpaw n ¼ 4, forepaw n ¼ 7, whisker n ¼ 1),
we recorded the responses to ON and OFF stimuli delivered to a
responsive surround location (either an adjacent whisker or an
adjacent digit). As expected, magnitudes of response to ON stimuli
signiﬁcantly and consistently decreased when the stimulus location
was moved from the receptive ﬁeld center to a responsive surround
location (paired t-test, P ¼ 0.0007). Conversely, the average magnitude of response to OFF stimuli did not signiﬁcantly change when the
stimulus location was moved from the receptive ﬁeld center to the
surround location (P ¼ 0.94). Consequently, the ON–OFF tuning
signiﬁcantly decreased when the stimulus location was moved from
the receptive ﬁeld center to the surround location (one-sided paired
t-test, P ¼ 0.0280) (Fig. 5).

urethane anesthesia, suggesting that under both anesthetics the state of
the thalamocortical system in our experimental conditions was
between the typical quiescent anesthetized state (0.28 Hz) (Aguilar
& Castro-Alamancos, 2005) and activated states obtained by
decreasing the level of anesthesia (2.9 Hz) (Aguilar & CastroAlamancos, 2005), or active states in awake animals (2.7 Hz)
(Fanselow & Nicolelis, 1999). We did ﬁnd two interesting, probably
related, differences between pentobarbital and urethane in the neural
responses to the stimuli: (i) magnitudes of response to ON stimuli and
to impulsive stimuli were greater in the pentobarbital group than in the
urethane group; and (ii) the difference between the latency of OFF
responses and the latency of ON responses was greater under
pentobarbital anesthesia than under urethane anesthesia. These effects
can probably be explained by the direct action of pentobarbital on
thalamocortical neurons (Wan & Puil, 2002), possibly rendering lowthreshold calcium currents easier to activate than under urethane
conditions. All other results did not differ between pentobarbital and
urethane anesthesia, suggesting that both anesthetics offer good and
comparable experimental conditions for studying the spatiotemporal
structure of thalamocortical responses. This is important because
urethane is normally preferred in acute experiments, but only
pentobarbital can be used in chronic experiments.

Discussion
Neurophysiological homogeneity of the ventrobasal complex
The main objective of this work was to test the neurophysiological
homogeneity of the ventrobasal complex by studying the responses of
thalamocortical neurons to ON, OFF and impulsive stimuli. We
observed essentially the same magnitude ⁄ latency response structure
for hindpaw neurons, forepaw neurons, and whisker neurons. The only
exception was the expected latency gradient from whisker to forepaw
to hindpaw neurons, due to the different times required to reach the
brainstem from the different stimulation sites. This neurophysiological
homogeneity between the VPM and VPL might seem surprising,
given the striking peripheral difference between the discrete whisker
pad and the continuous skin. VPM neurons, however, are speciﬁcally
tuned to precise angles of whisker deﬂection (Waite, 1973b; Simons &
Carvell, 1989), which makes the problem of deﬁning the principal
whisker of a VPM neuron and its preferred direction a continuous
search problem, as complex as deﬁning the receptive ﬁeld center of a
VPL neuron. The physiological equivalence between the VPM and
VPL is anatomically supported by the existence of angular tuning
maps in thalamic barreloids (Timofeeva et al., 2003): different angles
on the whisker pad correspond to different spatial coordinates within a
VPM barreloid, just as different locations on the skin correspond to
different spatial coordinates within a VPL cluster in the ventrobasal
complex. The neurophysiological homogeneity of the ventrobasal
complex validates the rat trigeminal system as a general model for
tactile processing, and is important for extending the knowledge
gained in VPM studies to the VPL when studying thalamocortical
reorganization after peripheral lesions (Miki et al., 2000; Zhao et al.,
2006) or spinal cord injury (Gerke et al., 2003; Hains et al., 2005,
2006; Hubscher & Johnson, 2006).

Thalamocortical responses with different anesthetics:
pentobarbital vs. urethane
To test the possible dependence of our results on the anesthetic used in
the experiments, we performed a detailed comparison between
pentobarbital and urethane anesthesia. The average spontaneous ﬁring
rate of our neurons (1.9 Hz) did not differ between pentobarbital and

Comparison between responses to ON stimuli, OFF stimuli
and impulsive stimuli
By comparing the responses to ON stimuli, OFF stimuli and impulsive
stimuli delivered to the center of the neurons’ receptive ﬁelds, we
obtained the following main results.
The ON–OFF tuning displayed a gradient across neurons, so that
some cells responded more to ON stimuli, and other cells responded
more to OFF stimuli. It is tempting to speculate that the ON–OFF
tuning could actually represent a one-dimensional projection of a
bidimensional (or even tridimensional) tuning curve. In other words,
thalamocortical neurons would be tuned to speciﬁc stimulus directions, thereby extending the angular tuning observed in the VPM
(Waite, 1973b; Simons & Carvell, 1989; Timofeeva et al., 2003;
Bruno & Sakmann, 2006) to the entire ventrobasal complex. The
gradient of ON–OFF tuning could also provide an effective mechanism to distribute somatosensory information across thalamocortical
neurons within individual clusters (VPL) or barreloids (VPM).
On average, response magnitudes were not signiﬁcantly different
between ON and OFF stimuli, whereas latencies of response to OFF
stimuli were longer, but by no more than few milliseconds, than those
to ON stimuli. Furthermore, the spontaneous ﬁring rate of neurons was
higher immediately before OFF stimuli than immediately before ON
stimuli, suggesting that with long pulses (e.g. 500 ms), neurons can
reach a slightly depolarized state when recovering from the postexcitatory inhibition triggered by ON stimuli and mediated through the
reticular nucleus (Pinault, 2004). This interpretation is conﬁrmed by
data from ongoing experiments in our laboratory using intracellular
recordings in the ventrobasal complex under the same stimulation
protocol (unpublished data). These observations are consistent with
the idea that OFF responses are generated by direct synaptic input,
possibly sustained by nonsynaptic mechanisms such as slow lowthreshold calcium currents (Kyriazi et al., 1994; Brecht & Sakmann,
2002; Minnery et al., 2003).
Latencies of response to ON and OFF stimuli were highly
correlated. This covariability is particularly appealing from a coding
perspective, as it neurophysiologically supports the idea that latency
codes based on spike-timing precision, well studied in cortex (Panzeri

386 J. Aguilar et al.
et al., 2001; Foffani et al., 2004), can be extended from the
representation of ON stimuli (Ghazanfar et al., 2000) to the
representation of continuously varying stimuli (Sosnik et al., 2001;
Montemurro et al., 2007).
Responses to impulsive and ON stimuli were highly correlated,
both in magnitude and latency, whereas the relationship between the
responses to impulsive stimuli and those to OFF stimuli was subtler,
so that impulsive responses represented a highly sublinear sum of ON
responses and OFF responses. ON–OFF stimuli and impulsive stimuli
therefore capture complementary aspects of the dynamic of thalamocortical responses to tactile stimuli.

Spatial structure
Thalamic receptive ﬁelds are remarkably large, especially during
information-processing states (Nicolelis & Chapin, 1994; Rivadulla
et al., 2003; Aguilar & Castro-Alamancos, 2005). Our results show
that the spatial structure of OFF responses does not parallel the spatial
structure of ON responses; namely, OFF responses do not consistently
decrease ) as ON responses do ) when stimuli are moved from the
center of a neuron’s receptive ﬁeld to a responsive surround location
(an adjacent whisker or an adjacent digit). This suggests that receptive
ﬁelds for OFF stimuli have a different spatial shape than those for ON
stimuli. From a functional perspective, the higher spatial precision of
ON responses could be critical for determining exactly where a
stimulus started, whereas the lower spatial precision of OFF responses
could provide a distributed signal of when a stimulus ended. From a
computational perspective, the different shape of receptive ﬁelds for
OFF responses as compared to those for ON responses could be
exploited to encode dynamic features of peripheral stimuli into
spatiotemporal patterns.

Conclusion
In summary, this work offers a systematic analysis of the responses of
hindpaw, forepaw and whisker thalamocortical neurons to stereotyped
tactile stimuli under two different anesthetics. Our results support the
view of a neurophysiologically homogeneous ventrobasal complex, in
which OFF responses participate in the structure of the spatiotemporal
receptive ﬁeld of thalamocortical neurons for tactile stimuli.

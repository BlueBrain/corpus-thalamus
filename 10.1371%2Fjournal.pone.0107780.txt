Abstract
Inhibitory interneurons (INs) in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) provide both axonal and dendritic GABA output to
thalamocortical relay cells (TCs). Distal parts of the IN dendrites often enter into complex arrangements known as triadic
synapses, where the IN dendrite plays a dual role as postsynaptic to retinal input and presynaptic to TC dendrites. Dendritic
GABA release can be triggered by retinal input, in a highly localized process that is functionally isolated from the soma, but
can also be triggered by somatically elicited Ca2+-spikes and possibly by backpropagating action potentials. Ca2+-spikes in
INs are predominantly mediated by T-type Ca2+-channels (T-channels). Due to the complex nature of the dendritic
signalling, the function of the IN is likely to depend critically on how T-channels are distributed over the somatodendritic
membrane (T-distribution). To study the relationship between the T-distribution and several IN response properties, we here
run a series of simulations where we vary the T-distribution in a multicompartmental IN model with a realistic morphology.
We find that the somatic response to somatic current injection is facilitated by a high T-channel density in the soma-region.
Conversely, a high T-channel density in the distal dendritic region is found to facilitate dendritic signalling in both the
outward direction (increases the response in distal dendrites to somatic input) and the inward direction (the soma responds
stronger to distal synaptic input). The real T-distribution is likely to reflect a compromise between several neural functions,
involving somatic response patterns and dendritic signalling.

involved in synaptic plasticity [17] and exocytosis [18,19]. Tchannels play an important role in a variety of cells [7,10,20].
Here, we study their role in neurons of the lateral geniculate
nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. Thalamocortical neurons (TCs)
and local interneurons (INs) in the LGN both display T-channel
mediated bursting [8,15,21]. Thalamic burst firing is thought to be
involved in generating oscillatory brain activity during periods of
sleep and generalized epilepsy [8,22,23]. In the LGN, burst firing
has also been found to play a role during awake visual processing
[24,25].
Experimental studies have pointed in somewhat different
directions regarding how T-channels are distributed on the
dendrites of TCs [26–31]. The lack of consensus inspired a
computational study which, rather than striving towards a direct
prediction of the actual distribution of T-channels, explored the
consequences that various T-channel distributions (T-distributions)
would have for the response properties of TCs [32]. It was
concluded that the propensity of the TC to elicit bursts of APs is
highest if the T-channels predominantly are localized in the
proximal dendrites. However, the study considered only somatic
responses to somatic current injections, and it is uncertain to which
degree the conclusions would hold for realistic, synaptic input [33].
Furthermore, it is conceivable that the subcellular distribution of

Introduction
A single neuron may contain a dozen or more different types of
ion channels, including the traditional AP-generating Na+- and
delayed-rectifier K+-channels and different types of Ca2+-channels.
The way each type of ion channel is distributed over the
somatodendritic membrane affects many aspects of neuronal
function [1–5]. The functional advantage of a specific subcellular
ion-channel distribution may depend on the morphology of the
specific neuron, and on its role within the signalling network [1].
In the case of Ca2+-channels, the subcellular distribution may also
impact on Ca2+-entry, which can trigger second messenger
cascades that are important for a variety of cellular processes
[6–9].
We focus in this paper on T-type Ca2+-channels (T-channels).
T-channels typically activate when neurons are depolarized from
relatively hyperpolarised resting potentials. Activation may lead to
the generation of low-threshold Ca2+-spikes, which in turn can
trigger bursts of action potentials (APs) [7,10]. Also T-channels
located in the dendrites can contribute to these bursts [11,12]. In
addition, dendritic T-channels are likely to amplify synaptic
responses [13,14], can provide a Ca2+ source for Ca2+-activated
K+-channels [15,16], and have been found in some cases to be

ion channels may be important also for neural properties other
than the somatic response generation.
The literature is also inconclusive regarding the T-distribution
in INs. An experiment using Ca2+-imaging techniques suggested a
density that increases linearly with distance (d) from the soma [26]
in the proximal dendrites (0 mmvdv60 mm). In this dendritic
region, the amplitudes of [Ca2+]-transients due to T-currents were
found to increase linearly with distance from soma. The findings
were interpreted in favour of a predominantly dendritic localization of T-channels [8,26]. A distal location of T-channels has
found some indirect support in other experimental observations
[8]. However, in a more recent experiment, based on genetic
markers, no correlation was found between the local diameter of
the dendrite and the expression of T-channels [29]. Given that the
dendritic diameter tends to decrease with distance from soma,
especially in the proximal region, these findings were taken to
indicate that T-channels were uniformly distributed, i.e., have the
same density over the whole somato-dendritic membrane [29]. To
our knowledge, no study has yet explored the relationship between
the T-distribution and the response properties of INs in a
systematic manner.
INs have longer and thinner dendrites than TCs, and are less
electronically compact [34,35]. The functional consequence of the
T-distribution can therefore be expected to be more critical in INs
than in TCs. It is also likely to be more complex, as INs can
provide GABA release both from axonal and dendritic terminals.
Distal IN dendrites often form so called triadic synapses with axons
of retinal ganglion cells and dendrites of TCs [36–39]. At these
sites, the IN dendrite is both postsynaptic to retinal input and
presynapic to TCs. To add to this complexity, GABA release from
the IN terminals in these triads may be triggered in several ways:
either directly by local synaptic input from the retina, in a process
that is functionally decoupled from the IN soma [38,40–42], or
when the IN soma elicits Ca2+-spikes [43], and possibly also by
backpropagating APs [43,44]. Hence, the complex function of INs
depends on the somatic firing properties as well as the two-way
communication between the soma and distal dendritic sites, both
of which are potentially influenced by the T-distribution.
In this work, we investigate how the distribution of T-channels
(T-distribution) affects a set of functionally important response
properties of INs, namely the somatic generation of regular APs
(R1), the backpropagation of APs into distal dendrites (R2), the
somatic generation of bursts of APs (R3), the spread of Ca2+-spikes
into distal dendrites (R4), and the integration of synaptic input
onto distal dendrites (R5). For all the response properties (R1-R5),
our research question is essentially the same: assuming that we
have a predefined amount of T-channels at our disposition, how
should we distribute the T-channels over the somatodendritic
membrane if the objective is to optimize for the respective
properties? To answer this question, we use a previously developed
multicompartment model of an LGN IN [45]. We run simulations
using six adapted versions of this model, each having a different Tdistribution, and compare their performance with respect to
response properties (R1-R5).
The simulations, presented in the Results section, show that
some of the response properties (R1 and R3) are facilitated by a Tdistribution biased towards the proximal dendrites, whereas others
(R2, R4, R5) are facilitated by a T-distribution biased towards the
distal dendrites. In the Discussion we comment on these findings,
and argue that the real T-distribution likely reflects a trade-off
between several functional properties, rather than being optimized
for a single function. Finally, the Methods section contains
technical details concerning the computational model.

Results
We explored the effect of the distribution of T-channels (Tdistribution) on the following neural properties, R1: somatic,
regular AP-firing R2: backpropagation of APs into distal
dendrites, R3: somatic burst firing, R4: dendritic Ca2+-spikes,
and R5: synaptic integration.
All simulations were performed on a multicompartment model
of INs (adapted from [45]). The model was built using a realistic
morphology based on a 3D-reconstruction of a mouse interneuron
(Fig. 1A). It included standard Hodgkin-Huxley type Na+ and
direct rectifying K+-channels for AP generation, in addition to the
T-type Ca2+ channels. The model was presented in six versions,
each characterized by a different T-distribution (Fig. 1B), namely
(i) the soma-distribution, Dsoma (red), where all T-channels were in
the soma, (ii) the proximal-distribution, Dprox (yellow), where Tchannels were clustered in the proximaldendritic region and in the
soma, (iii) the uniform-distribution, Duni (blue), where T-channels
were uniformly distributed over the membrane, (iv) the middledistribution, Dmid (cyan), where T-channels were clustered in
dendritic regions halfway between the soma and the distal
dendrites, (v) the linear-distribution, Dlin (green), where the
density of T-channel increased linearly with distance from soma,
and (vi) the distal-distribution, Ddist (magenta), where T-channels
were clustered in distal dendrites. The T-channel distributions
were normalized so that all model versions had the same total
number of T-channels (see Methods section for further details).
Of the included distributions, Dprox , Duni and Dlin are the most
likely candidates for representing the real distribution. Duni was in
accordance with experimental data based on genetic markers [29],
whereas both Dprox and Dlin were in close agreement with
experimental data based Ca2+-imaging [26]. In both Dprox and
Dlin , the T-density increased in a linear or close-to-linear fashion
for the first 60 mm of the dendrites like in the experiments. With
Dlin , the initial linear trend was extrapolated to the full dendritic
tree whereas Dprox , modelled with a Gaussian function, peaked at
d~60 mm and decreased gradually with greater distances from the
soma. Both experimental studies indicated a non-zero density of
T-channels in both the soma and dendrites (at least in the
proximal dendrites) of INs [26,29]. In the current computational
study, Dmid and Ddist had a T-density close to zero in the soma,
whereas Dsoma had a T-density of zero in the dendrites. These
models are therefore unlikely to represent the real distributions,
but were included in the study to explore the extreme limiting
cases.

Model properties
It has been suggested that IN firing under physiological
conditions is predominantly controlled by synaptic input to the
proximal dendrites [39]. In our simulations, IN responses (i.e., in
the membrane potential, Vm ) were instead evoked with somatic
current injections, as this enabled us to compare our results with
experimental literature using current-clamp recordings [15,43,45].
Experimentally, it has been found that activation of 1-4 synapses
can evoke somatic excitatory post-synaptic current (EPSC)
amplitudes between 30 and 600 pA in INs [43]. In all simulations
presented in the following, the stimulus amplitude was within this
physiologically realistic range. The IN model was able to
qualitatively reproduce the two major types of response characteristics that have been observed in the IN, namely, 1) regular APfiring, characterized by a steady stream of action potentials and 2)
burst firing, characterized by bursts of APs that ride atop Ca2+spikes [15,23,43,45–47].

conductances to zero (Fig. 2B, dashed lines). The Ca2+-spikes
successfully invaded the dendritic arbor of the INs (Fig. 3B), as in
[43].
A broad range of stimulus amplitudes and different Tdistributions produced qualitatively similar responses to those
shown in the representative examples in Figs.2 and 3. These
response patterns and their dependence on the T-distribution are
further analyzed below.

A prolonged current injection with a relatively low amplitude
(ilong v50 pA) evoked an initial phase of rapid AP-firing, followed
by slower, regular AP-firing (Fig. 2A). The response to the
prolonged stimulus resembled that observed experimentally [45–
47]. Single APs successfully backpropagated into the distal
dendrites of the IN (Fig. 3A), as has also been seen in experiments
[43,44]. A brief current injection with high amplitude
(ibrief w180pA) evoked a pronounced burst of APs (Fig. 2B).
The response to the brief stimulus resembled that observed
experimentally in [43]. The burst rode atop a Ca2+-spike mediated
by T-channels [15,23,45]. The Ca2+-spike could be seen in

propensity to fire regular (non-burst) APs (R1), we counted the
number of regular APs elicited during the last 700 ms of the
(1000 ms) stimulus period (we started the count 300 ms after the
stimulus onset to make sure that the neuron had settled into
regular AP-firing). For example, a stimulus ilong of amplitude 36
pA gave a count of 4 regular APs in that time range with Ddist
(Fig. 2A-iii).
When the experiment was repeated for different stimulus
amplitudes and T-distributions, we obtained the input/output (I/
O)-curves in Fig. 2C. For all T-distributions, the regular AP-firing
rate increased with stimulus amplitude, with slopes of around 4
APs/pA (this corresponds to about 5-6 Hz/pA, as we counted in a
700 ms period). In a previous modelling study, we showed INs are

iii)) were as good as identical. AP-backpropagation was also very
similar in the different distributions. In all cases, the AP
experienced a broadening and a decrease in amplitude upon its
propagation away from the soma.
Fig. 4 summarizes AP-backpropagation in three different
dendritic branches, and for all T-distributions. Fig. 4(A–C) shows
the AP-amplitude (Vpeak ) as a function of distance from the soma
in three different branches (Fig. 1A). The panels (A–C) in Fig. 4
represent the different branches, while the six curves in each panel
represent different T-distributions. The exact evolution of the AP
amplitude will depend on complex morphological features of the
branching dendrites. We do not explore this in further detail here,
but focus solely on how AP-propagation is influenced by Tdistribution.
The exact shape of the attenuation profile depends on branchspecific morphological features of the interneuron (see Fig. S3 for a
detailed explanation). Despite morphological variation between
the branches (compare panels A–C), AP propagation followed the
same general trend. In the proximal dendrites, the AP amplitude
decreased monotonically with distance from soma, from about
26.7 mV in the soma to between 210 mV and 215 mV at a
distance of around 140mm from the soma. At intermediate
distances 100mmvxv400mm, Vpeak varied between 215 and
0 mV. In the distal dendrites xw500mm, the AP amplitude
increased with distance from soma, reaching an amplitude
between 8 and 16 mV at the end point.

likely to possess modulatory mechanisms that would reduce the AP
firing rate [45]. As no modulatory mechanisms were included in
our current model, it generally showed a higher AP-firing
frequency than that observed experimentally in INs, where I/Ocurves typically have slopes that vary from about 0.2-0.5 Hz/pA
[45,47] and up to about 3Hz/pA [46]. We do not believe,
however, that the high AP-firing rates obtained with our model
would influence our results regarding the role of T-channels.
Regardless of the value used for stimulus amplitude ilong , the
highest firing rate was consistently achieved with Dsoma and Dprox ,
while Dlin and Ddist gave the lowest firing rate. This indicates that
regular somatic firing of regular APs is facilitated by having Tchannels in close proximity to the soma.
Successful AP-backpropagation does not depend on Tdistribution. In the following simulations, the same current

injection ilong ~36pA was used in all simulations of AP-propagation to evoke regular AP-firing. We studied the effect of the Tdistribution on the backpropagation of a single, regular AP (R2).
In order to circumvent any distortion effect that might be related
to the initial Ca2+-spike, we focused on the last AP in the series of
regular APs (obtained by using the prolonged stimulus protocol)
and observed its propagation along different dendritic branches.
Fig. 3A shows, in selected segments along a single branch, how
the amplitude and shape of the (last) single AP evolved as it (back-)
propagated from the soma towards the distal dendrites. The

density of CaT channels increases in distal dendrites.

A comparison between Vpeak -curves for each individual branch
(A–C) shows that the T-distribution had a relatively small impact
on Vpeak . Also, there was no trend in how the T-distributions
influenced the local Vpeak . For example, Ddist gave the lowest
Vpeak at the endpoint of one branch (Fig. 4A), and the highest
Vpeak at the endpoint of another branch (Fig. 4C). We conclude
that the T-distribution had no clear effect on the shape and
amplitude of backpropagating APs.

case, however, where another set of initial parameters was used
(see Fig. S5), Duni was observed to be slower than all the other
distributions in branch 3.

Bursts and Ca2+-spikes
In this section, we study burst firing, evoked here with a brief
(10 ms) current injection in the soma (Fig. 2B-iv). During the
bursts, the AP amplitude varied, a phenomenon observed both
experimentally and in previous modelling studies [15,45]. We here
focus on the effect of the T-distribution on the burst (R3), the
magnitude of the Ca2+-spike, and the way that the Ca2+-spike is
conveyed to distal dendrites (R4). For a quantitative measure of
the effect of the T-distribution on the burst for a given stimulus, we
use the number of APs riding the crest of the low-threshold Ca2+spike (Fig. 2B).

the propagation speed of APs (R2). The time at which AP-peak
value is reached (tpeak ) in a given segment is plotted as a function of
distance from the soma in branches 1–3 (Fig. 4(D–F)). In all
branches, backpropagating APs took consistently less time to reach
dendritic endpoints when the T-density was high in those regions
(Dlin and Ddist ). In general, backpropagation took longer when the
T-density was low in the distal regions (Dsoma and Dprox ). In one

amplitude. As the area under the response curve depends on both
these aspects, we reasoned that it represented a functionally
relevant quantification of the magnitude of the Ca2+-spike.
In all model versions, the Ca2+-spike area increased with
increasing stimulus injection, but approached saturation and
increased little when ibrief was increased beyond 300 pA (Fig. 5D).
Interestingly, the T-distribution that gave the biggest Ca2+-spike
response, depended on the stimulus injection. For a relatively weak
stimulus (ibrief ~100pA), Ddist gave the biggest response area. For
stimuli at intermediate strength (ibrief ~200pA), Dsoma and Dprox
gave the biggest response area. Finally, for strong stimuli
(ibrief ~300pA), Duni , Dmid and Dlin gave the biggest response
area. We do not go further into the details of this, but we make use
of this analysis below, when we study how the Ca2+-spike is
conveyed from the soma to distal dendrites.

elicited during a burst (R3) as a function of the stimulus amplitude,
for all the different T-distributions. For strong current injections
(ibrief w250pA), the number of APs in the burst tended to saturate
beyond a certain stimulus amplitude. This suggests that the Tdistribution sets an upper limit to the the number of APs that can
be elicited by somatic bursts, and thus elucidates the fundamental
role of T-channels in burst generation. The effect of the Tdistribution on the bursts was similar to that observed for regular
AP-firing. Above a certain stimulus amplitude (ibrief w200pA), we
consistently observed that the model versions with T-channels
close to the soma (Dsoma and Dprox ) elicited the bursts with the
highest number of APs. Qualitatively similar results have been
found previously, in a computational study of TCs [32] where the
somatic bursting propensity was also found to be facilitated by a
high T-density in the proximal dendritic region.
We conclude that the propensity of the soma to elicit bursts of
APs (as well as regular APs) is facilitated by a T-distribution biased
towards the soma-region. These findings were not unexpected. As
the stimulus injection was applied to the soma, it seems reasonable
that a high density of T-channels in the proximity of (or in) this
compartment would boost the local response.
Effect of T-distribution on somatic Ca2+-spikes. It is
known that Ca2+-spikes can trigger dendritic GABA-release in
INs, even when AP-firing is suppressed by the Na+-channel
blocker TTX [43]. GABA-release triggered by Ca2+-spikes has
been found to have a longer duration compared to the (axonal and
possibly dendritic) GABA-release triggered by single APs [43].
This implies that the Ca2+-spike has an important functional role
beyond that of mediating bursts of APs, and motivated us to
conduct a further study of the Ca2+-spike in isolation.
In the following simulations (Fig. 5), the Na+ conductance was
therefore set to zero so as to suppress the APs in the burst. Brief
current injections then evoked Ca2+-spikes. In order to gauge the
effect of the T-channels on the response, we compared the somatic
voltage response of the different model distributions with the
response obtained when no T-channels were included in the
model (referred to as the null-distribution, black line).
Simulations were run for different stimulus amplitudes. In all
cases (Fig. 5A–C), the brief stimulus caused an initial peak in Vm
after 10 ms. After stimulus offset, Vm initially started to decay
towards the resting potential (Vrest ). However, the relatively slow
activation of the T-channels gave rise to an inward T-current
which interfered with the passive decay. To describe the observed
responses, we make a distinction between full and partial Ca2+spikes. When the T-current proceeding from the stimulus was
strong enough to evoke a second, post-stimulus depolarization,
and thus a second local maxima in Vm at some point after the
stimulus offset (tw10 ms), we considered that we had a full Ca2+spike. Full Ca2+-spikes were, in all T-distribution models, evoked
only for strong stimulus amplitudes (Fig. 5C). For weaker stimulus
amplitudes (Fig. 5A–B), only a subset of the distributions elicited
full Ca2+-spikes. For example, with ibrief ~100pA, only Ddist
elicited a full Ca2+-spike (Fig. 5A). For the other distributions, the
T-current merely slowed down the decay of Vm towards the
resting potential, compared to what we would expect from a
purely passive response. We refer to this kind of T-channel
mediated response as partial Ca2+-spikes.
For a quantitative measure of the magnitude of the Ca2+-spike,
we chose to use the area under the response curve. This was partly
practically motivated as, e.g., a quantification in terms of the peak
amplitude could not be defined in the case of partial Ca2+-spikes.
However, as we know that Ca2+-spikes trigger dendritic actions
distinct from that of single APs [43], these actions likely depend on
the time-course of the depolarization, and not only the peak

T-distribution affects the way somatic Ca2+-spikes are
conveyed to distal dendrites. Next, we investigated the

influence of the T-distribution on how well somatically elicited
Ca2+-spikes were conveyed to distal dendritic sites (R4). In the case
of AP backpropagation, it was clear that the AP originated in the
soma, and then propagated towards the distal dendrites (Figs. 3
and 4). The time-aspect of dendritic Ca2+-spikes was more
complex. As T-channels have much slower kinetics than Na+channels, T-channels over the entire dendritic tree had overlapping activation time, and contributed simultaneously to the
generation of Ca2+-spikes. In the case of Ca2+-spikes, it would
therefore not be appropriate to speak of propagation. For instance,
for Ddist , the Ca2+-spike reached its peak value earlier in the distal
dendrite than in the soma, although the current injection was
applied to the soma (Fig. 3D). We did not explore the time-aspect
of Ca2+-spikes further, but from now on focus on their magnitude.
In Fig. 6A–C, we have plotted the Ca2+-spike magnitude as
function of the distance from soma in three different branches.
The local magnitude of the Ca2+-spikes depended on two factors:
(i) the proximity to the injection site, and (ii) the local T-density.
The first factor (i) explains the results obtained with Duni (blue
line). In that case, the Ca2+-spike-magnitude decreased with
distance from soma, almost in parallel to how the passive response
obtained with the null-distribution decreased with distance (black
line). In case of Dsoma and Dprox (red and yellow lines), the Ca2+spike-magnitude decreased more steeply with distance from soma,
due to the additional effect (ii) of decreasing T-density. In case of
Ddist or Dlin (purple and green lines), the second factor (ii)
dominated over the first (i), and the Ca2+-spike response
magnitude increased with distance from the soma, giving a
maximum value at dendritic endpoints, where the T-density was
highest. Finally, in case of Dmid (cyan line), the Ca2+-spike
response magnitude was either highest in the soma (Fig. 6(A,C)),
where the stimulus was applied, or around 300mm from the soma,
where the T-density was highest (Fig. 6B). For distances greater
than 300mm from the soma, the Ca2+-spike-magnitude decreased
slowly with distance from soma.
Next, we explored how the trends identified in Fig. 6A–C
depended on the amplitude of the somatic current injection. As we
were mainly interested in how Ca2+-spikes were conveyed to
dendritic endpoints, i.e., the typical locations of triadic synapses,
we limited the analysis to explore the Ca2+-spike-magnitude at the
tips of the three dendritic branches (Fig. 6D–F). The trends that
we identified in Fig. 6 A–C were robust for all stimulus injection
above a certain threshold (ibrief w200pA). Below this threshold,
the Ca2+-spike-magnitudes were quite similar in all model
versions, except in Ddist , where the Ca2+-spike had a high
amplitude in the distal dendrites, even for very weak stimuli
(ibrief v100pA). However, we recall from Fig. 5 that, for

well defined peaks in Vm . We therefore regard the results obtained
with stimuli above 200 pA as most relevant for our study of Ca2+spikes.
We conclude that, for brief somatic current injections strong
enough to evoke full Ca2+-spikes in all model versions, the Ca2+spike-magnitude in the tips of the dendrites was facilitated by
having a high distal density of T-channels (Dlin and Ddist ). Similar
results were found when we used another parametrization (P1) of
the model (Figs. S5–S7).

the local, dendritic response. When all the T-channels were in the
soma, the local dendritic EPSP to the synaptic input had a peak
amplitude of about -20 mV (Fig. 7A). A non-zero T-density in the
distal dendrite significantly prolonged the duration of the local
EPSP-response at the synaptic site (Fig. 7B–D). A similar role for
dendritic T-channels has been proposed in an earlier, general
computational study [48].
The propagation of the EPSP towards the soma is summarized
for all six distributions in Figs. 8A–C, which show how the peak
amplitude of the signal vary with distance from the soma in 3
different branches. While the duration of the EPSPs (Fig. 7) varied
with different T-distributions, their amplitudes at the synaptic sites
were similar. The attenuation profiles of the signals as they
propagated towards the soma were similar in appearance except
for Dlin and Ddist . In the case of Ddist especially, there was a
significant boost in the response partly caused by the presence of
T-channels along the way. We note here that the signal boost is far
more significant in branches 1 and 3 than in branch 2, showing
that it is affected not only by the distribution of the T-channels,
but also by morphological features. Branch 2 has fewer
ramifications (i.e. smaller membrane area) and thus fewer Tchannels in the distal regions than branches 1 and 3 where the
signal is given an additional boost as a result of backpropagation
from nearby dendritic branches. This explains the smaller
difference between the linear and the distal distribution for this
particular branch. In fact, when we used another parametrization
P1 (see Methods), Dlin turned out to be more efficient than Ddist
for this branch (see Fig. S9).

Synaptic integration
Finally, we investigated the impact of the T-distribution on
synaptic integration (R5). Excitatory postsynaptic potentials
(EPSPs) were evoked by a AMPA synapse inserted at the end
points in one of the three branches (1, 2 and 3 in Fig. 1A). The
synapse was adapted to experimental data for AMPA-synapses on
thalamocortical relay neurons [41], and is described in further
detail in the Methods section. To isolate effects due to T-channels,
the sodium conductance was blocked. However, qualitatively
similar results were obtained when the sodium conductance was
not blocked (Figs. S1 and S2).

Due to the low-pass filtering properties of the dendrites, the
most enduring EPSPs experienced the least attenuation during
propagation. This is apparent in Fig. 8D–F, which shows EPSPamplitude in the soma as a function of the synaptic strength. The
general trend was that the EPSP amplitude in the soma was higher

maximized by having a high local T-density boost the signal before

gave rise to a higher regular AP-firing rate (R1) and a higher
number of APs in a burst (R3). On the other hand, a high Tdensity in the distal dendrites facilitated the conveyance of somatic
signals to distal dendrites, by increasing AP propagation speed
(R2) and increasing the voltage deflections evoked in distal
dendrites by somatic Ca2+-spikes. Interestingly, a high distal Tdensity also facilitated the somatic integration of distal synaptic
input(R5). Thus, there was an asymmetry in the signalling between

Ca2+ Channel Distribution in Geniculate Interneurons

Below we revisit the response properties (R1-R5) and comment
on their putative importance for the function of INs, and the
degree to which we may expect the T-distribution to be a key
factor in controlling them. We also discuss the possible impact of
some of the ion channels that were not included in our model
[15,45,47,49] on these properties.

away from the proximal region towards the distal dendrites
(Fig. 2). On the other hand, differences in burst shapes between
INs and TCs may also be explained by differences in total Tconductance and T-channel kinetics [21]. In fact, characteristics of
IN bursts and the numbers of APs therein tend to vary quite
significantly between different INs [15,49]. It is therefore difficult
to use a quantitative comparison between the simulated bursts in
Fig. 2 and experimentally observed bursts to deduce the most
likely T-distribution.
Somatic burst firing may also depend on ion channels not
included in this study. Ca2+-activated non-selective cation
channels (iCAN ), for example, have been found to prolong the
duration of bursts in INs, and in some cases evoke plateaupotentials [15]. As iCAN in INs is thought to be activated
predominantly by Ca2+ entering through T-channels [15], its
presence could serve to amplify T-channel mediated effects, and
make the functional consequences of the T-distribution even more
pronounced. A hyperpolarization-activated non-specific cation
channel (ih ) has been identified in INs [45,55]. ih has been found to
contribute to the generation of rebound bursts [45], i.e., bursts that
the IN elicit when it is released from holding potentials far more
hyperpolarized than the resting potential. However, due to the
strong hyperpolarizations required to activate ih [45], it is unlikely
that ih would be active in the situations that we studied in the
current work.
Although most studies have indicated that burst firing in INs is
predominantly mediated by T-channels [8,15,21,23,26,46,49],
one experiment has observed bursts that could be abolished by the
appliance of the L-type Ca2+ channels blocker nimodipine [43],
suggesting that these Ca2+-spikes and bursts were mediated by iL .
Nimodipine has also been found to have a strong impact on
dendritic GABA-release [43,56], and post-synaptic NMDAresponses [57] in INs suggesting that iL may have several
functional roles in INs that may overlap with those of T-channels.
The bursts observed in [43] were evoked by brief (10 ms) stimulus
injections to the soma, and showed a striking similarity (in terms of
amplitude, duration and number of APs) to the bursts that we
obtained in our simulations when we used the same stimulus
protocol (compare Fig. 2 with Fig. 1 in [43]). In our study, bursts
were a robust response feature, generated by T-channels that were
modelled with activation kinetics based on experimental data from
INs [21,45]. This raises questions regarding the distinct roles of Tchannels and iL for IN signalling. Bursts mediated by iL also seem
to somehow challenge the high depolarization required for iL
activation in previous experiments [26,49]. A potential resolution
to these apparently conflicting findings could be that nimodipine
also interacts with T-channels, and that some of the effects of
nimodipine appliance can be ascribed to the suppression of Tchannel mediated activity. Experimental evidence that nimodipine
may act on T-channels is sparse, but a nimodipine-induced
reduction of T-channel activity has been demonstrated in neurons
of the lateral dorsal nucleus of the thalamus [58]. We do not know
if this is a plausible hypothesis in INs, but rather wish to pose it as
an open question to the research community.

R1: Somatic, regular AP-firing
It seems unlikely that the T-distribution should be adapted to
yield a certain regular AP-firing rate in INs. In our simulations, the
increase in firing rate gained from changing between the two
extreme T-distributions (from Ddist to Dsoma ) could also be
achieved with a relatively small (20%) increase in the stimulus
amplitude, suggesting that the AP-firing rate could be controlled
by any depolarizing current. Based on general knowledge of neural
firing properties, we would expect it to chiefly be controlled by
Na+- and K+-channels [50]. Ca2+-dependent afterhyperpolarization currents may also be involved in reducing the IN firing rate
[45].
Several other membrane mechanisms (not included in the
current model) may also affect the AP-firing rate. For example, Ltype Ca2+ channels (iL ) have been shown to activate through
depolarizations positive to -35mV [26,49]. This suggests that they
should predominantly open during AP firing. Ca2+ influx through
iL could then provide a source for activation of Ca2+-dependent
afterhyperpolarization channels (iAHP ), which could reduce the
AP-firing frequency in thalamic neurons [45,51].

R2: Backpropagation of APs into distal dendrites
We showed that AP-backpropagation could be speeded up with
a high T-density in distal dendrites (Fig. 4). To our knowledge, this
is the first study that has predicted an impact of T-channels on APpropagation speed. It is however unlikely that its potential impact
on the AP-propagation speed is the key role of the T-distribution.
Generally, the most important prerequisite for AP-backpropagation is the dendritic Na+-conductance [44,52]. Other conductances could play a role. For example, INs possess A-type K+-channels
(iA ) [49]. This ion channel type has been found to influence APbackpropagation in hippocampal neurons [53]. It also remains
unclear whether backpropagating APs play a role in mediating IN
output [43].

R3: Somatic burst firing
It has been established that T-channels are the main mediators
of bursts in INs [8,15,21,45,49], although contributions from other
ion channels have been found. Our simulations showed that,
beyond a certain stimulus, the number of APs elicited during a
burst tended to saturate towards a maximum value, which
depended on the T-distribution (Fig. 2). This highlights the
unique role of T-channels in burst generation. The T-distribution
is thus likely to have adapted, at least partly, to regulate the
somatic bursting pattern, as has been suggested for other thalamic
neurons [11,32].
As in TCs [32], a high T-density in the proximal dendrites
resulted in a greater propensity for somatic bursting. However, in
INs, the T-distribution may not be optimized solely to enhance the
number of APs in a burst. Experimentally recorded IN bursts
typically having a lower intraburst AP-frequency and a longer
duration than TC bursts [15,21,46,47], are closer in resemblance
to thalamic reticular (RE) neurons. In RE neurons, which have
been likened to INs [54], prolonged bursts have been explained by
a high T-density in distal dendrites [11]. Our simulations also
indicate that a reduction in the intraburst AP-firing frequency and
a prolonged burst-duration may result from moving T-channels
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

R4: Dendritic spread of Ca2+-spikes
The Ca2+-spikes underlying the bursts, and the manner in
which these are conveyed to distant sites in IN dendrites is of
particular interest. Dendritic Ca2+-spikes have been known to
trigger GABA-release from IN dendrites, even when AP-firing was
suppressed by the Na+-channel blocker TTX [43]. Furthermore,
GABA-release has been found to have a longer duration when
triggered by Ca2+-spikes than when triggered by single APs [43].
The T-distribution could therefore have adapted in a way that
12

September 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 9 | e107780

Ca2+ Channel Distribution in Geniculate Interneurons

guarantees that Ca2+-spikes are well conveyed to the distal
dendrites. The T-distributions that were found to favour this
function did not favour somatic bursting (R3) and vice-versa. On
one hand, a high proximal T-density increases the number of APs
in the burst (Fig. 2), and thus the axonal IN output. On the other
hand, a high distal T-density increases the response magnitude of
Ca2+-spikes in distal dendrites (Fig. 6), and putatively the dendritic
output of INs. More detailed insight into the action of dendritic
Ca2+-spikes will have to await experimental identification of the
detailed mechanisms behind dendritic GABA-release, which are
currently unknown. It has been suggested that GABA-release is
controlled by a local voltage threshold [59]. A second possibility,
that GABA-release rather depend on widespread (i.e., not highly
localized to presynaptic terminals), intracellular Ca2+-dynamics,
has also been discussed [43,60]. Ca2+ entering through T-channels
has been shown to be involved in exocytosis in some neurons
[18,19], yet it is unknown whether this is the case in thalamic
neurons. Another possible action of dendritic Ca2+-spikes could be
to provide depolarizations necessary for the relief of the voltagedependent Mg2+-block of NMDA-receptors, which could induce
changes in the post-synaptic strength [61,62].
Note that we have focused primarily on signalling between the
soma and most distal dendritic endpoints. However, it is possible
that Ca2+-spike triggered GABA-release may occur throughout the
dendritic tree. If we had looked at Ca2+-spikes from more
proximal dendritic sites, our conclusions regarding the optimal Tdistribution would have been different.

course of the experimental EPSCs. This is due to the low-pass
filtering properties of the long and thin dendrites, which would
tend to broaden the somatic EPSCs. With the synapse model that
we used, we found that the experimental EPSCs could only be
reproduced if we placed it closer to the soma. For example, with a
synaptic weight of 2 nS, and with a uniform T-distribution, we
obtained EPSCs that agreed with the experimental recordings
(amplitude of 50 pA and duration of about 5ms) when the synapse
was placed 300mm from the soma (branch 1). The EPSCs in the
experiments [43] were thus likely due to more proximal input.

Final remarks
A common conception in biology is that any phenotype, such as
the T-distribution, has evolved or been adapted to optimize for a
certain biological function. In modelling it is also common to use
the reverse argument, i.e., if a theoretical study demonstrates that
a specific (hypothetical) T-distribution is optimal for a certain
function, it can be considered a prediction that this be the real Tdistribution. Our simulations did not converge to any such
prediction of the real T-distribution, as we found that different Tdistributions were optimal for different IN properties (R1-R5).
Since all the properties considered here are of putative importance
for different aspects of the INs function within the LGN-circuitry,
the real T-distribution is likely to reflect a compromise between the
different properties (and thereby between different functions).
There is also a theoretical possibility that the effective Tdistribution may vary between INs, or even vary dynamically
within a single IN. It is known that some neurons may use activity
sensors to dynamically regulate the density of ion channels on their
membrane to maintain a stable pattern of activity and to
compensate for ongoing, state dependent processes [66]. Tchannels modulation by acetylcholine, dopamine and several other
transmitter substances has also been demonstrated in several
excitable cells [67]. Although response properties of INs are
modulated by state dependent input from various regions of the
brain [38,40,57,68], there is no experimental evidence that Tchannels are subject to dynamic regulation or modulation in INs.
However, one could speculate that such regulation or modulation
could change the effective distribution of T-channels over time.
This could be one potential explanation of the discrepancy
between the two experimental studies of the T-distribution in INs
[26,29]. It could also provide a mechanism for the IN to switch
between a predominantly dendritic and a predominanly somatoaxonal output regime.
The study that we have presented here was motivated by the
complex role of IN dendrites within the LGN circuitry. As IN
dendrites are long, thin and electrotonically non-compact, and as
they serve dual roles as both input and output channels, we
hypothesized that the subcellular T-distribution could play a
particularly important role in this neuron type. However, although
our simulations and motivations were cell specific, we believe that
our results shed light on the way the T-distribution affects neural
signalling in general.

R5: Synaptic integration
The response to distal synaptic input is a complex topic. A high
distal T-density was shown to boost and prolong the EPSPs in the
soma (Fig. 8), thus enhancing the integration of distal synaptic
input (Fig. 7). This has been proposed earlier as a key functional
role of distal T-channels in RE neurons [63]. However, because
the dendrites in INs are long and leaky, somatic activity of INs
could be controlled more efficiently by synapses positioned at
more proximal locations [39].
Also, triadic synapses in distal dendrites may release GABA as a
response to local, synaptic input from the retina, i.e., without
requiring involvement from the soma of INs [36,39,41,43,57,59].
In fact, it might even be undesirable to have strong somatic EPSPs
evoked by dendritic input to the triads, as the purpose of their
distal location may be to ensure a certain electrical decoupling
from the soma [40,57,59,64]. The main function of distal,
postsynaptic terminals may therefore be to trigger local output
rather than to control somatic firing. T-channels could very well
play a role in this localized release machinery, as a high distal Tdensity would increase the duration of the local postsynaptic
depolarization (Fig. 7). The possible gain from this would, as we
discussed for the Ca2+-spikes above, depend on the unknown local
condition for dendritic GABA release. It is also possible that there
may be multiple trigger mechanisms for local GABA-release, as
has been observed, e.g., in granule cells in the olfactory system.
There, Ca2+ entering through NMDA-receptors may trigger
vesicle release in a highly localized fashion, whereas voltagedependent vesicle release also may occur, but then typically
triggered by backpropagating APs [65].
Data on synaptic activation in INs is sparse, but one experiment
has shown the somatic EPSC-response to the activation of a single
synapse with unknown location (see Fig. 4 in [43]). The
experimental EPSC had a duration of about 5 ms, and amplitude
of about 50 pA. In additional simulations (results not shown), we
found that a distal synapse, no matter how fast and strong, could
not produce EPSCs that matched both the amplitude and time

Model and Methods

Simulations were run with the NEURON/Python simulating
environment [69]. We used a reduced version of the previously
developed multicompartmental model of the LGN IN [45],
implemented in NEURON [70]. The original model was adapted
to current clamp recordings from two different interneurons. It
was presented with in two versions (parameterizations P1 and P2),
which were able to capture the somewhat different response

properties of the two neurons. The reduced model adopted the
morphology and the passive properties from the original model
[45]. Simulations based on a reduced version of parametrization
P2 are presented in the main article. Simulations based on a
reduced version of parametrization P1 are found in Figs. S4 - S9.
We chose to use P2 for the main presentation. This was because
P2 had a more hyperpolarized resting potential (Vm ~{69 mV)
compared to P1 (Vm ~{63 mV), and showed the most pronounced effects of T-channel activation. However, qualitatively
similar results were obtained with both parameterizations.

We adopted the Na+ and K+ reversal potentials (ENa ~50 mV
and EK ~{90 mV), and the kinetics of the gating variables m, h
and n from the original model [45]. However, in the reduced (new)
model, we adjusted the Na-activation threshold and the maximum
conductances (gNa and gKdr ) to account for recent experimental
studies, which reported that (i) somatically generated APs
successfully invade distal dendrites of INs, whereas (ii) synaptic
input to distal dendrites was never observed to evoke APs that
initiated locally in the dendrites [44].
In both P2 and P1, the sodium kinetics which was shifted by 0.2 mV (from -50.3 mV to -50.5 mV) relative to the threshold in
the original model. These values were found to (i) ensure successful
(back-)propagation of APs into distal dendrites, and (ii) reduce as
much as possible the ability of dendritic compartments to evoke
local APs.

Morphology
The morphology used in all simulations was based on a realistic,
3D reconstruction of a mouse IN (Fig. 1A). The model interneuron consisted of a soma and 104 dendritic sections, that were
subdivided in smaller segments, resulting in a total of 330
segments. The total surface area of the model IN was 9864mm2 ;
the summed length of all dendrites was 5771mm; the longest
dendrite was 673mm, and the mean somatodendritic diameter was
about 0:5 mm.

T-channels
Passive properties

The model of the T-channel was adopted from the original
model [45], but is described in detail here due to its high relevance
for the current project. It was modelled using the GoldmanHodgkin-Katz formulation [72]:

The axial (cytoplastic) resistivity, Ra , the membrane capacitance, Cm and the membrane resistance, Rm were adopted from
the original model [45] for both P1 and P2. The values that were
used are indicated in Table 1.
As T-channels have a nonzero activation level around the
resting potential, changing the T-distribution could lead to
changes in the resting potential. We prevented this from
happening by adjusting the reversal potential of the passive leak
current (Epas ) so that the IN always had the same somatic resting
potential (-69 mV in the P2 version, and -63 mV in the P1
version).

Of the seven active ion channels in the original model [45], only
three were included in the reduced model. These were, in addition
to the T-type Ca2+-channel, the traditional AP-generating Na+and delayed-rectifier K+-channels (Na and Kdr). The conductances
of iL , ih , iAMP and iCAN channels were set to 0.
We had several reasons for using a reduced version of the
original multicompartmental model [45], excluding some of the
ion channels (ih , iAHP , iCAN and iL -channels). Firstly, stripping the
model down to the essentials allowed us to investigate the effect of
the T-distribution in isolation, and made the results easier to
interpret. Secondly, the subcellular ion-channel distribution is
poorly known for most ion channels in INs. Adding additional
mechanisms would have meant introducing additional unconstrained parameters to the model. It is uncertain whether this
would have led to more realistic simulations, especially when it
comes to dendritic signalling. Thirdly, the fact that the simplified
model was sufficient to generate all the essential response features
that we were interested in exploring (Fig. 2), validated our
conclusions, at least on a qualitative level.

The rationale behind using a different modelling scheme for Tchannels is that intracellular Na+ and K+-concentrations typically
are on the orders of several millimolars, and change little during
normal neural activity. In contrast, the intracellular Ca2+concentration is on the order of nanomolars and may experience
substantial relative changes following Ca2+-influx.
The model of the T-channel was adopted from the original
model, and we refer to that work for a description of the kinetics of
the gating variables m and n. Only the distribution of PT was

The Na and Kdr-channels were described by the standard

essentially accounts for the dependence of the Ca2+-reversal
potential on intracellular (½Ca2z ) and the extracellular (½Ca2z e )
Ca2+-concentrations. In Eq. 4, Z~2 is the valence of the Ca2+ions, R is the gas constant, F is Faraday’s constant and T is the
absolute temperature. Note that the function G (Eq. 4) has units
mC=cm3 , so that the product PT :G has the units (mA=cm2 ) of a
current density.
The extracellular Ca2+-concentration was assumed to be
constant (½Ca2z e ~2 mM). The intracellular Ca2+-dynamics was
modelled as a leaky integrator:

T-channel distribution. The model was presented in six
versions (Fig. 1B), characterized by distributions of T-channels
over the somatodendritic membrane. The T-channel distributions
were normalized so that all model versions had the same mean
permeability pmean (i.e., the same total number of T-channels) in
the neuron as a whole. The normalization criterion was:

secondary APs explain features observed for e.g. in Fig. 4F in
the main article, where the AP peak amplitude was observed
earlier in the branch endpoints than at distal dendritic locations
close to the endpoint.

Output
In all simulations the model output was the voltage response to a
given input. Model output was as specified in the different
subsections in the results section and included voltage amplitude,
number of action potentials, and calcium spike magnitude.
Calcium spikes typically had a duration of 100 - 200 ms and
were followed by a small undershoot, i.e., a brief period with
Vm vVrest . Calcium spike magnitude was calculated as the integral
of the function Vm {Vrest taken from the stimulus onset to the
time where the voltage descended below the resting potential.

P1. (A) A prolonged (1000 ms) stimulus protocol, ilong ~59pA (Aiv), evoked an initial high AP-firing frequency phase as in P2. With
P1 however, the subsequent AP firing showed some irregularity
that was not observed with P2 (e.g. for the soma and distal
distributions). This irregularity was related to Ca2+-oscillations
evoked by the generally higher T-density in P1 compared with P2.
(B) A brief (10 ms) stimulus protocol, ibrief ~300pA (B-iv), evoked
a burst of APs. When AP firing was suppressed by setting the Na+conductance to 0, the Ca2+-spike underlying the burst was
revealed (dashed lines). (C) Number of regular APs elicited during
the last 700 ms of the stimulus period as a function of prolonged

observed. (D) Number of APs elicited in bursts as a function of

Figure S5 P1 - Effect of T-distribution on AP backpropagation. Analogous figure to Fig. 4 in main text, but with
parameterization P1. (A–C) In each segment of a selected branch,
the peak amplitude of last action potential (Fig. S4A) (left panel)
and (D–F) the time taken from soma to reach peak amplitude
(right panel) are plotted as a function of distance from soma (peak
time, tpeak , was plotted relative to the time of the somatic AP-peak
(t~0)). The study of AP propagation was more complicated in P1
than it was in P2. As implied by the irregularity in the AP-firing
pattern (Fig. S4), two successive APs did not experience identical
local conditions. In most cases, AP propagation still followed the
same general trend as we obtained with P2 (see main article). An
exception was found in branch 3, where Dsoma and Dprox
unexpectedly gave rise to faster AP-propagation than the uniform
distribution (F). A closer investigation revealed that this was
related to interaction between successive APs, which occurred with
Dsoma and Dprox due to the short intraspike intervals (high APfiring frequency) obtained with these distributions. With these
distributions, a subset of the APs failed to successfully invade the
distal dendrite. These unsuccessful APs experienced passive
attenuation in the distal regions of the dendrites. As the membrane
was not repolarized in those cases by the fast K+ current that
accompanies full APs, the depolarizations evoked were more
enduring. The membrane potential is thus higher upon arrival of
the subsequent AP, which is then able to successfully invade the
distal dendrite. This may explain why the APs that did invade the
distal dendrites in the case of Dsoma and Dprox (those plotted in C
and F) were faster than one of the other distributions (Duni ), where
all APs invaded the distal dendrites. Still, in P1 as in P2, we
obtained the fastest AP-propagation with a high distal T-density
(Dlin and Ddist ). The insight gained from the special case of branch
3, can indicate that our conclusions regarding AP propagation are
valid in case of regular AP firing at relatively low firing frequencies
(i.e., with relatively long intraspike intervals that prevent
interaction between two successive APs).

Impact of morphology of dendritic branches
on signal propagation. (A) The distal part of branch 3. In the
paper, we only plotted signals propagating along the main path,
i.e. the direct path from the soma to the most distal dendritic
endpoint (dark blue segments). However, the rest of the dendritic
tree (light blue segments) also had a significant impact on the
propagation of the signal. (B) Waveform of backpropagating APs
at different distances from soma along the main path (blue curves)
and highlighted in red, green and black at selected locations,
marked in A by arrows of the corresponding colour. APs that
propagate along the main path increase in amplitude upon
approaching a nearby endpoint. The red curve represents a signal
in a neighbouring segment (not along the main path), which also
happens to be at an endpoint. The light blue curves directly
beneath the red curve in B, show the AP waveforms in the region
marked with an ellipse in A, situated at around 200–250 mm from
the soma. Specific morphological features like this explain the
attenuation profiles shown in the main part of the article (Fig. 4).
APs may also take a deflection at branch endpoints and propagate
back in the direction of the soma. At the location marked with a
green arrow in A, we therefore first observe the primary AP from
the soma, and then the secondary AP propagating towards the
soma (green curve in B). In this specific case, the secondary AP has

effect was more pronounced in branches 1 and 3 than in branch 2,
due to morphological differences between the branches. Branch 2

fewer T-channels in the distal regions than branches 1 and 3. (D–

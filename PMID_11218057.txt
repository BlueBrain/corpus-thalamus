Parvalbumin and GABA in the developing somatosensory thalamus
of the rat: an immunocytochemical ultrastructural correlation

Accepted: 7 September 2000

Abstract The calcium binding protein parvalbumin
(PV) is widely distributed in the mammalian nervous
system and its relationship with GABAergic neurons differs within thalamic nuclei and animal species. In the rat
somatosensory thalamus PV immunoreactive (ir) neurons were found only in the GABAergic reticular thalamic nucleus (RT), while a dense PVir neuropil is present in the ventrobasal complex (VB). In this study the
distribution and relationship of PV and GABA were investigated in RT and VB during postnatal development
at electron microscopic level. The pre-embedding immunoperoxidase detection of PV was combined with the
post-embedding immunogold localization of GABA. In
RT, at all developmental ages, neuronal cell bodies, dendrites and rare axonal terminals were both PVir and
GABAir. In VB during the first postnatal week several
small vesicle-containing profiles were double-labelled
and some of them were identifiable as synaptic terminals. From postnatal day 7 (P7) to P9 the medial part of
VB was more intensely PVir than the lateral one and
some differences in the sequence of maturation of PVir
terminals were noted between these two VB subdivisions. Single-labelled PVir profiles were first observed at
P8, whereas single-labelled PVir terminals appeared at
P12 and at P15 they became more frequent and larger,
showing the typical morphology of ascending afferents
described in adult VB. These results demonstrate the late
expression of PV and acquisition of adult morphology in
ascending terminals of rat VB during postnatal development in comparison with the innervation arising from the
GABAergic RT.

Introduction
Numerous studies have pointed out the importance of the
differential and restricted distribution of the calcium
binding proteins (CaBPs) parvalbumin (PV), calbindin
and calretinin in the mammalian nervous system (Celio
1990; Résibois and Rogers 1992; Andressen et al. 1993).
In particular, several lines of evidence have indicated
that in thalamic nuclei these CaBPs are variously
expressed in different mammalian species (Jones and
Hendry 1989; Bentivoglio et al. 1990; Rausell et al.
1992; Arai et al. 1994; De Biasi et al. 1994a; Herron
et al. 1997) and during development (Frassoni et al.
1991, 1998). In the adult rat thalamus PV is expressed
only by neurons of the reticular nucleus (RT) and by axonal fibers and puncta in different nuclei of the dorsal
thalamus (Celio 1990; Arai et al. 1994). During postnatal
development a lateromedial gradient of the PV expression in the dorsal thalamus has been reported (Frassoni
et al. 1991), so that at birth PV immunoreactivity is already evident in RT neurons and in fibers and puncta of
the adjacent ventrobasal complex (VB), two of the thalamic nuclei involved in the processing of somatosensory inputs. On the contrary, the posterior thalamic nucleus, the third main somatosensory system-related thalamic nucleus, virtually lacks PV immunoreactivity at all developmental ages and in adulthood (Frassoni et al. 1991;
Arai et al. 1994; Williams et al. 1994). In spite of the intense PV immunoreactivity described by light microscopy, no ultrastructural studies have so far been performed
to characterize the PV-positive profiles in RT and VB.
As in other brain areas, the PV immunoreactive (ir)
neurons of rat RT also contain the major inhibitory transmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA; De Biasi et al. 1986,
1988; Arcelli et al. 1997). On the contrary, thalamic-projecting neurons in the brainstem are PV-positive but non-

110

GABAergic (Bennett-Clarke et al. 1992; Polgar and
Antal 1995; Magnusson et al. 1996). As a consequence,
in double-labelling experiments using antisera against
PV and GABA in the somatosensory thalamus, the terminals originating from RT can be identified by their expression of both GABA and PV, whereas the terminals
ascending from brainstem can be identified by their single PV immunoreactivity. Finally, the virtual absence of
GABAergic local circuit neurons in rat VB (Barbaresi et
al. 1986; De Biasi et al. 1988, 1997), allows us to infer
that the single GABA-positive terminals in this area
originate from extrathalamic sources (Parent et al. 1988;
Rajakumar et al. 1994; Shammah-Lagnado et al. 1996;
Wang et al. 1999).
The aim of this study was to provide further information on the development of the intrinsic synaptic circuitry of RT and VB by investigating and correlating at the
electron microscopic level the expression of PV and
GABA from birth to adulthood.
In particular, by combining PV and GABA ultrastructural immunolocalizations, we could identify the PVir
GABA-negative lemniscal afferents to VB (BennettClarke et al. 1992; Williams et al. 1994; Magnusson et
al. 1996) and analyze their maturational sequence during
postnatal development. Our results complement previous
light microscopic studies on the development of ascending trigeminal afferents to the medial part of the rat
VB (ventroposteromedial nucleus; VPM)(Huang 1989;
Chiaia et al. 1991; Killackey 1993; Jacquin et al. 1996;
Leamey and Ho 1998), and the scarce data available on
the development of projections from the dorsal column
nuclei (DCN; Asanuma et al. 1988; Spreafico et al.
1993; De Biasi et al. 1994b) to its lateral portion (ventroposterolateral nucleus; VPL).
Preliminary results have been presented in abstract
form (Amadeo et al. 1997).

Materials and methods
Animals

Immunocytochemistry for PV
Serial, alternate sections throughout the whole rostrocaudal extent
of RT were processed for the immunocytochemical detection of
PV. After quenching of aldehyde groups with 0.05 M NH4Cl in PB
(30 min), sections were treated with 1% H2O2 (5 min) in PB to
block endogenous peroxidases. The sections from rats perfused
with high concentration of glutaraldehyde were also treated with
1% NaBH4 in PB (15 min). The penetration of immunoreagents
was increased by freezing the sections in liquid nitrogen and thawing in PB containing 20% sucrose, after cryoprotection in 10%
and 20% PB-sucrose (1 h each). The pretreatment (30 min) with
10% normal goat serum (NGS) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
was followed by incubation overnight at room temperature in a
rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against rat PV (SWant, Bellinzona, Switzerland) diluted 1:10,000 in PBS containing 1% NGS.
The specificity characteristics of this antibody have been previously described (Celio 1990). After multiple rinses in PBS, sections were incubated for 75 min in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit
IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.) diluted 1:200 in
PBS/NGS 1%, rinsed in PBS, and incubated for 75 min in the
avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC kit, Vector, 1:100 in
PBS/NGS 1%). After rinsing in PBS and in 0.05 M TRIS HCl
buffer (pH 7.6) sections were reacted in a fresh solution containing 0.05% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma,
Aldrich, Milano, Italy) and 0.002% H2O2 in TRIS HCl. Sections
were then rinsed in buffer, mounted on gelatine-coated slides, dehydrated, and coverslipped. Substitution of the primary antiserum
by preimmune serum and omission of the various steps in the immunocytochemical procedure resulted in no immunolabelling in
control sections.
Electron microscopy
Some of the PV-immunolabelled sections containing RT and VB
were selected from P4, P7, P8, P9, P12, P15, and adult brains.
After postfixation with 2.5% glutaraldeyde (10 min) and then with
1% osmium tetroxide in PB (1 h), sections were dehydrated in
ethanol and flat embedded in Epon-Spurr between acetate sheets
(Aclar, Ted Pella, Redding, Calif.). Blocks were trimmed out under a dissection microscope from RT, VPL and VPM nuclei and
glued to epoxy blanks. Thin sections were cut with a Reichert
ultramicrotome and collected on nickel grids.

The present study is based on rats (Wistar, Charles River Italia,
Calco, LC, Italy) ranging from the day of birth, defined as postnatal day 0 (P0), to the end of the second postnatal week (P15) and
adult animals. A total of 16 rats were studied as follows: P0, n=1;
P4, n=2; P7, n=2; P8, n=1; P9, n=2; P12, n=3; P15, n=2; adult,
n=3. All the experiments were undertaken in accordance with
guidelines established in the Principles of Laboratory Animals
Care (NIH Pubblication No. 86-23, revised 1985). All efforts were
made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of
animals used. No in vitro alternatives were possible to obtain the
results presented in the paper.
After anaesthesia with chloral hydrate (4%, 2 ml/100 g body
weight) by intraperitoneal injection, the rats were perfused transcardially with a fixative solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde
and 0.5% glutaraldehyde (fixative A) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(PB), pH 7.2, after a rapid wash with 1% paraformaldehyde. Two
animals (P8 and P12) were perfused with a different solution containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% paraformaldehyde (fixative
B). Brains were then removed from the skull and postfixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde. Serial, coronal sections (50–60 µm thick) were
cut through the diencephalon using a Vibratome 1000 (Ted Pella,

Redding, Calif.), collected in cold PB and used for PV immunolocalization. Alternate sections adjacent to those processed for immunocytochemistry were stained with thionin and the atlases of
Paxinos et al. (1991) and Paxinos and Watson (1986) were used
for the identification of developing and adult thalamic nuclei respectively.

Immunocytochemistry for GABA
To demonstrate the relationship between PVir and GABAir profiles, pre embedding immunoreaction for PV on some of the thin
sections was combined with a post embedding immunogold procedure for the detection of GABA. For two selected and crucial
postnatal ages (P8 and P12) the use of fixative B containing a high
concentration of glutaraldehyde gave better results for GABA immunolabelling than fixative A.
After immersion in 0.5% aqueous sodium borohydride (5–
8 min for postnatal tissue, 10 min for adults), grids were rinsed in
0.05 M TRIS buffered saline pH 7.6 (TBS), incubated at room
temperature with 3% NGS (30 min) and then with the anti-GABA
serum (Sigma, Aldrich, Milano, Italy; 1:10,000) in TBS (overnight at room temperature). After extensive rinses in TBS and
TBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), grids were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a solution of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins coupled to 15 nm gold particles (Biocell,
Cardiff, U.K.), diluted 1:20 in TBS (pH 8.2) containing 1% BSA.
Several rinses in TBS and distilled water were followed by
staining with lead citrate (2 min). Controls for GABA immunogold labelling were done on thin sections using the anti-GABA serum preadsorbed with GABA, as previously described in detail
(De Biasi et al. 1994c), or by omitting the primary antiserum from
the labelling sequence. No colloidal gold particles were seen in
control sections.
Thin sections, with or without immunogold labelling, were
counterstained or not with lead citrate, and examined with a Jeol
T8 (Tokyo, Japan) electron microscope. The ultrastructural identification of neuronal profiles in neonatal samples was performed
using the morphological criteria described by Vaughn (1989) and
De Biasi et al. (1996). As for the adult, the data on RT ultrastructure were related to previous electron microscopic studies (Ohara
and Lieberman 1985; De Biasi et al. 1988), whereas the identification in VB of large terminals as ascending projections and of medium sized boutons with flat vesicles as RT afferents was based on
the results of published ultrastructural analyses (Peshansky et al.
1985; De Biasi et al. 1994c; Williams et al. 1994).

Results
Light microscopy
The examination of thalamic sections immunolabelled
for PV at the different postnatal ages showed that RT
neurons and VB neuropil were intensely labelled as early
as P0 (Fig. 1A). RT neurons showed PV immunoreactivity throughout the rostrocaudal and dorsoventral extent
of the nucleus (Fig. 1A, C, D, F, G). Some differences
were observed only in the rostral pole of RT during the
first postnatal week, where an inhomogeneous distribution of PVir neurons was revealed.
In the developing VB some variations in the distribution of PV immunoreactivity were observed. During the
first postnatal week, PV immunolabelling was generally
present in several parallel fibers arising from RT and following a lateromedial trajectory (Fig. 1A, B). Some of
them showed terminal swellings morphologically similar
to growth cones (Fig. 1B). Moreover, few scattered multipolar PVir neurons were observed in VPL (Fig. 1A, C)
and rarely also in VPM (Fig. 1C). From the end of the
first postnatal week VB appeared more intensely labelled
than at previous ages and its two subdivisions (VPL and
VPM) showed a different distribution of PV immunoreactivity (Fig. 1C). From P7 to P9 VPM appeared more

intensely labelled than VPL and was characterized by
peculiar clusters of PVir fibers and puncta (Fig. 1C–E)
described also by Frassoni et al. (1991). From P9 the
PVir innervation was homogeneously distributed in VPL
and VPM (Fig. 1D, F, G). By the end of the second postnatal week also the medial lemniscus began to show PV
immunoreactivity (Fig. 1F).
Electron microscopy
The ultrastructural analysis was performed on blocks
containing RT, VPL and VPM at selected postnatal ages
from P4 to P15 and in the adult. PV immunoreactivity
could be visualized by the presence of DAB reaction
product consisting of fine, granular electrondense material; in the double-labelled sections GABA immunoreactivity was easily distinguishable from PV immunoreactivity since it was represented by colloidal gold particles.
The distribution of GABA-labelling in RT and VB of
postnatal and adult rats was as previously reported
(De Biasi et al. 1986, 1988, 1997), and therefore it will
be described only in correlation with the distribution of
PV immunoreactivity.
PV and GABA immunoreactivities in RT
During postnatal development PV immunoreactivity was
detected in neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, growth cones
and unmyelinated and (only from P8) myelinated fibers
(Fig. 2A–E). PV-positive cell bodies often showed several somatic protrusions, sometimes surrounding unlabelled vesicle-containing profiles (Fig. 2B) or receiving
presynaptically convex synaptic contacts from small terminals. In the adult RT few PVir axonal terminals contacting distal dendrites were found (Fig. 2D). In the double-labelled sections GABA immunoreactivity was present in most of the PV-positive structures (Fig. 2A, B, E);
moreover an increasing number of single GABA-immunolabelled synaptic terminals was present from P4 to
adult (Fig. 2E; see also De Biasi et al. 1997).
PV and GABA immunoreactivities in VB
In the two subdivisions of VB, VPL and VPM, PV immunoreactivity was generally found in axonal processes
identifiable as growth cones, vesicle-rich profiles and
synaptic terminals (Figs. 3A–F, 4A–E), whereas only
very few dendritic profiles showed immunolabelling for
PV. Since several modifications occurred in this region
during postnatal development, the animals examined
were divided into four age groups, also to better correlate PV and GABA immunoreactivities at the different
developmental stages.

P4–P7
During the first postnatal week PVir was present mainly
in growth cones containing large vacuoles and microtubules, in irregular shaped vesicle-rich profiles and in
small axons (Fig. 3B, E). Some small to medium sized
PVir synaptic terminals were also observed (Fig. 3A, C,
E); these boutons mostly contacted distal dendrites with
synapses that were generally symmetric or undetermined
and flat or “frown” (see De Biasi et al. 1996). In the double-labelling experiments GABA immunoreactivity was
always present in all the described PV-positive profiles
(Fig. 3B, C). At the end of the first postnatal week an increased number of double-labelled synaptic terminals
was observed mainly in VPM.

Discussion

At P12 M type terminals were either single GABAir and
double-labelled and they showed a mature morphology
(Fig. 4A). The single PV-positive profiles were more frequent than in the previous developmental stage and larger than the double-labelled ones (Fig. 4B). These large
PV-ir terminals (L type) were characterized by a pale immunolabelling and contained small clear vesicles, sever-

The present ultrastructural data demonstrate a different
progressive maturation between the GABAergic system
arising from RT and the ascending projections to VB.
Some peculiar features of PV immunolabelling in RT
and VB at certain stages of postnatal development will
be commented upon and correlated with our ultrastructural analysis.

At these ages most of medium-sized synaptic terminals
(M type) were PVir and GABAir; they generally formed
mature synapses of the symmetric type and contained
small clear vesicles and mitochondria (Fig. 3D). Moreover, at this stage of postnatal development, besides double-labelled and single GABAir structures, an increasing
number of single PVir small vesicle-rich profiles and axons was observed (Fig. 3F). In VPM they sometimes
made synaptic contacts. Single PV immunoreactivity
was rarely observed also in boutons making multiple
synapses on different unlabelled profiles.

In the adult VB neuropil several types of synaptic terminals were morphologically and neurochemically recognized. Two different types of PVir boutons were characterized by their arrangement and morphology and by the
presence or absence of GABA immunoreactivity. The
L-type terminals were always GABA-negative and contacted proximal dendrites, more often on several dendritic spines, forming asymmetric synapses (Fig. 4D, E).
The M-type terminals showed also GABA immunoreactivity and were generally more regular in shape and
full of clear vesicles and mitochondria; they formed
symmetric synapses with different targets including the
proximal dendrites contacted by two or more L terminals
(Fig. 4D). In the neuropil of VPM the PV-single labelled
terminals were often smaller, still more frequent and
clustered than in VPL (Fig. 4E).

terminals were more frequently observed than in VPL.
At P15 the distribution of PV and GABA immunoreactivities was very similar to that at P12; an increasing
number of PVir L-type terminals, often very large and
connected to the proximal dendrites by several puncta
adhaerentia, was observed (Fig. 4C).

Reticular nucleus
PV and GABA are considered as markers of RT neurons
during postnatal development and in the adult (De Biasi
et al. 1986, 1997; Celio 1990; Frassoni et al. 1991;
Mitrofanis 1992). An inhomogeneous distribution of
PVir (this study; Mitrofanis 1992) and GABAir (A.
Amadeo, personal communication) neurons was however observed in the rostral pole of RT at light microscopy,
where a peculiar neurochemical content was also described in other studies (Arai et al. 1994; Lizier et al.
1997). As regards the somatosensory sector of RT, the
ultrastructural finding of scarce PVir/GABAir terminals
during development indicates that recurrent collaterals
are rare in this area, thus confirming previous ultrastructural results (De Biasi et al. 1996; 1997). However, double-labelled terminals, representing recurrent collaterals,
are also very few in adult RT (this study; Pinault et al.
1997), whereas the number of single GABA-positive terminals increases during development (De Biasi et al.
1996, 1997), suggesting that GABAergic terminals in RT
mostly originate from extrathalamic sources (Asanuma
and Porter 1990).
Ventrobasal complex
Our results show the presence of a few scattered PVir
multipolar neurons with a restricted dendritic tree in the
rat VB, presumedly representing the rare (less than 1%)
GABAergic local circuit neurons of the rat VB (Harris
and Hendrickson 1987; Arcelli et al. 1997).
The pattern of distribution of PVir neuropil in the rat
VB confirms the previous study on PV expression in the
rat thalamus during postnatal development (Frassoni et
al. 1991), pointing out the increased PV immunoreactivity in VB and the transient hyperinnervation of its medial
part (VPM) during the second postnatal week. In this
study the sequential analysis of PV single expression and
double PV/GABA immunolabelling in synaptic terminals of VB has been used as a tool to describe the development of some projections to this thalamic nucleus during the first two postnatal weeks. The PVir afferents
to the adult rat VB originate essentially from: (a) the adjacent PVir and GABAir RT (Peschansky et al. 1983;
De Biasi et al. 1988); (b) the trigeminal nucleus principalis (PrV) for VPM (Chiaia et al. 1991; Bennett-Clarke
et al. 1992; Williams et al. 1994); (c) the DCN for VPL
(Peshansky et al. 1985; Ma et al. 1987; De Biasi et al.
1994c; Magnusson et al. 1996). Among the PVir afferents to VB, those from RT are the most precocious, since
RT neurons were shown to be already PVir at birth and
to project to the thalamus during embryonic life (Solbach
and Celio 1991; Mitrofanis and Baker 1993). Therefore
it is likely that the PVir fibers with a lateromedial trajectory observed at light microscopy in the first postnatal
days and the double-labelled boutons (M type) detected
at electron microscopy in VB from P4 represent the reticulothalamic afferents characterized by morphological

features that were consistent with a previous ultrastructural study (De Biasi et al. 1997). The expression of PV
by ascending afferents from DCN and PrV was recently
described in adults (Bennett-Clarke et al. 1992; Magnusson et al. 1996), yet scarce data are available on their development (Solbach and Celio 1991). Trigeminal afferents reach the thalamus at E17 (Leamey and Ho 1998),
while lemniscal afferents do it in the first postnatal days
(Asanuma et al. 1988). In this regard, recent studies have
described the ultrastructural morphology of the afferents
from DCN during early (P3) postnatal development by
means of axonal tracing experiments (Spreafico et al.
1993; De Biasi et al. 1994b). However, in this study single PV immunoreactivity was never observed in VB neuropil during the first postnatal week, in line with preliminary data demonstrating the first appeareance of PVir
neurons in DCN and PrV only from P8 on (S. De Biasi,
unpublished observations). Just at this developmental
stage (P8–9) the single PVir terminals (the future L type)
began to be distinguished from the reticular double-labelled boutons (M type) exclusively for their different
neurochemical content. Only at P12 single PVir terminals became larger, showing the typical features of ascending afferents (Ma et al. 1987; De Biasi et al. 1988,
1994c; Williams et al. 1994), in line with the findings of
a recent ultrastructural study of the developing rat VB
(De Biasi et al. 1996). On these bases, the increase of PV
immunoreactivity observed in VB since the end of the
first postnatal week could be due to the late expression
of PV (second postnatal week) by the ascending afferents, which in turn can be correlated with the maturation
of their physiological activity (Solbach and Celio 1991)
and with the acquisition of a mature ultrastructural morphology that in the rat VB gradually develops by the second postnatal week (De Biasi et al. 1996, 1997).
The other interesting observation is that in VPM, during the second postnatal week, there is a transient PVir
hyperinnervation and a peculiar distribution of PVir fibres that reflects the presence of rods of neural tissue,
the barreloids, representing faithfully the vibrissae on the
face (Killackey 1993; Land et al. 1995). In the rat VPM
the barreloids are particularly evident during the first
two postnatal weeks both with histochemical and axonal
transport methods (Killackey 1993; Land et al. 1995),
whereas after P15 they are obscured by a postnatal rotation of the rat VB relative to the major axes of the diencephalon (Land and Simmons 1985; Land et al. 1995). In
line with these data, we could not identify PVir barreloids in the adult VB. The transient PVir hyperinnervation
of VPM with respect to VPL during the second postnatal
week could be explained by the particular concentration
of reticular and trigeminal afferents in the core of barreloids that, rotating by P15 (Land et al. 1995), give rise
to an apparent decrease of PV immunoreactivity in
VPM. Alternatively, an overgrowth of ascending trigeminal afferents could be proposed (Asanuma et al. 1988).
At the ultrastructural level a slight difference between
the maturational sequences of terminals in VPL and
VPM was observed. During the first postnatal week the

118

PVir/GABAir synaptic terminals originating from RT are
more easily found in VPM than in VPL, where they are
generally smaller. Later, in the second postnatal week,
the L-type terminals displaying single PV immunoreactivity appear larger, more mature and clustered in VPM
than that in VPL. By contrast, in the adult VPM they
were smaller but more numerous than in VPL. So far,
no comparative data are available on the ultrastructural
developmental features of VPL and VPM. However, an
earlier arrival of afferents to VPM as compared with
VPL has been reported (Asanuma et al. 1988; Killackey
1993; Spreafico et al. 1993; De Biasi et al. 1994b;
Leamey and Ho 1998). On these bases, considering the
precocious morphological maturity of PVir L-type terminals in the rat VPM and the correlation of PV expression
with the stage of maturation of a particular afferent
system (Solbach and Celio 1991), it could be suggested
that in VPM the synaptic circuit organization develops
slightly before that in VPL.
Finally, in the adult rat VB we clearly demonstrated
the presence of two PVir afferent systems characterized
by means of their neurochemical content and of their
morphological features. Double-labelled reticular terminals (M type) showed the ultrastructural characteristics
of the “F” boutons in the rat VB ( De Biasi et al. 1988,
1994c), whose symmetric synapses and GABA content
demonstrate their inhibitory function and their origin
from RT. The large (L type) PVir synaptic terminals
resemble the ascending afferents described in several
axonal tracing studies both in VPL (Ma et al. 1987;
De Biasi et al. 1988, 1994) and in VPM (Williams et al.
1994); however this study represents the first report of
their PV immunoreactivity. These large PVir terminals
contact mainly proximal dendrites and their spines both
in VPL and in VPM. The only difference from the previous studies is the rarity of somatic PVir contacts that
were described both for terminals arising from DCN
(Ma et al. 1987; De Biasi et al. 1988) and from trigeminal afferents (Williams et al. 1994). Since PVir neurons
projecting from brainstem to VB represent a subpopulation of the total neuronal group innervating the ventrobasal thalamus (Bennett-Clarke et al. 1992; Magnusson
et al. 1996), it is possible that their terminals have a particular and more selected distribution on thalamic neurons. Furthermore, our observations demonstrate that the
PVir L terminals in the adult are smaller, more numerous
and clustered in VPM than in VPL. On these bases it
could be suggested that the PVir trigeminal projections
show a peculiar and more definite distribution and organization in the VPM neuropil in comparison with other
ascending afferents to VB. This conclusion together with
the early maturation of the trigeminal system could be
correlated with the precise topographical organization of
this sensory pathway.

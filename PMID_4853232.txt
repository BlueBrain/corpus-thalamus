Abstract
I. A model of a neuronal network has been set up in a digital
computer based on histological and biophysical data experimentally
obtained from the thalamus; the model includes two populations
of neurons interconnected by means of negative feedback; in the
model allowance is also made for other sort of interactions.
2. To test the hypothesis that the alpha-rhythm (8-13 Hz
rhythmic activity characteristic of the EEG) is a filtered noise signal
the simulated neuronal network was stimulated by random trains of
pulses with a Poisson distribution. The density of pulses fired by the
simulated neurons was computed as well as the oscillations of the
mean membrane potential of the population of simulated neurons.
The latter was found to be equivalent to the experimentally obtained
alpha rhythms.
3. In order to test the hypothesis that several noise sources are
responsible for thalamo-corticalcoherences three simulated neuronal
networks were coupled together using several noise sources as
secondary inputs. It was shown that although all the networks
produced simulated alpha signals with identical spectra they could
have significantly different values of coherence depending on the
relation between correlated and uncorrelated input signals.
4. The model Was analysed by means of linear systems analysis
after introducing the necessary simplifications and approximations.
In this way it was possible to evaluate the influence of different
physiological or histological parameters upon the statistical
properties of the resulting rhythmic activity in an analytical form.
5. By changing the model parameters it was shown that a
family of spectral curves could be obtained which simulated the
development of the EEG as function of age from a predominantly
low frequency to a clearly rhythmic type of signal. This was shown
to depend mainly on the feedback coupling parameters.

1. The Hypothesis
S o m e of the e x p e r i m e n t a l results o b t a i n e d in the
d o g have been the object of a full r e p o r t (Lopes
d a Silva et al., 1973). T h e y can be s u m m a r i z e d as
follows: a l p h a - r h y t h m s have been r e c o r d e d from
cortical a n d t h a l a m i c areas using c h r o n i c indwelling
electrodes while the eyes o f the dogs were closed.
T h e a l p h a - r h y t h m s p r e s e n t e d the characteristics of a

consistently larger t h a n the t h a l a m o - c o r t i c a l coherences which have so far been o b t a i n e d .
These results led us to f o r m u l a t e the h y p o t h e s i s
that a l p h a - r h y t h m s m a y be a s s u m e d to be signals

2. The Model
In this article, we shall limit ourselves to the
research carried out to test the hypothesis presented
above by use of a digital computer simulation of a
neural network. Our attempt in this direction differs
from that of others. On the one hand, we did not
assume self-oscillating networks as have others (cf.
review Rashevsky, 1971). On the other hand, our
approach differed from that of Anderson et al. (1966)
in that
- - the output of our model was the summed postsynaptic potentials and not the probability of firing
of neurons,

- - we did not include the phenomenon of postanodal exaltation which has been refuted on good
physiological grounds (Purpura, 1970) and
- - we considered the model's output under steadystate conditions with a noise input and therefore not
transient responses.
The model was based on histological data from
the ventro-postero-lateral nucleus of the thalamus
published by T6mb61 (1967). We used these histological
data because these results gave the best quantitative
information concerning any structure capable of
generating alpha-rhythms which we had at our
disposal. Two types of neurons were assumed: the
thalamo-cortical relay cells or TCR neurons, and the
interneurons IN. The fundamental principle of interaction between T C R and IN neurons was that a T C R
would excite one or more IN neurons via a recurrent
collateral of its axon. The latter, in turn, would inhibit
a group of T C R neurons (negative feedback). To keep
the structure as simple as possible we did not assume,
at the start, the possibility of positive feedback (TCR
axon collaterals exciting other T C R cells), or, of
direct input to IN cells which probably exists and may
play an important role as a gating mechanism for
the occurrence and disappearance of alpha-rhythms.

illustrated were used both in the computer simulations and in the
systems analysis of the model
2.1 The Model's Structure

In the model, 144 T C R and 36 interneurons were
simulated in a doublefolded matrix, i.e. in a matrix
without boundaries as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, the
ratio T C R / I N neurons was 4 which agrees well with
histological data (3-6 following T6mb61). The basic
m e m b r a n e properties of the neurons were assumed as
follows:
The wave of depolarization and the wave of hyperpolarization corresponding to the excitatory and
inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (EPSP and IPSP,
respectively) were simulated as shown in Fig. 2.

F. H. Lopes da Silva et al.: Model of Brain Activity

It was assumed that the intracellular membrane
potential in the resting state was - 6 0 mV, and that
this potential could not decrease in the course of
hyperpolarization below - 80 mV (Vmin).A theoretical
saturation level was also included so that the intracellular potential should not exceed +30mV(Vs,t).
In order to compute the membrane potential
changes as a function of time, we employed simplified
equations. In all computations, time was discrete in
samples of 4 msec. In the model, a wave of depolarization was given by the following expression:
Vi+ 1 =aVi + ni. V1

(1)

where ni" V1 is the combination of n waves of depolarization which are originated in the time unit i
due to the arrival of n action potentials; a is a constant
factor, 0 < a < 1 chosen as indicated below.
The real change is, however, a function of the
momentary value of the membrane potential:
Vi+l = a V i +

V~at

hi. V1.

(2)

The constants a and V1 are chosen so that in the case
where n 1 -- 1 and nj = 0(j > 1), Eq. (2) gives an EPSP
with the form given in Fig. 2.
If V1 = 1 mV then a = 0 . 7 , and one wave of depolarization (or equivalent EPSP) lasts about 30 msec.
In most simulations, we took a = 0.8 and V1 = 1.2 mV.
It should be realized that a wave of depolarization
represents approximately one EPSP.
For the purpose of simulating the wave of hyperpolarization, Eq. (3) was used:

V,+I=bV,+

V.,in-- V~ 6
V,~
Y~ ni_~.V~
j=O

(3)

where b is a constant factor, Vmin is as defined above.
The parameters V~(j= 0, 1..... 6) are chosen so that
Eq. (3) gives a good fit to the desired wave form for
the hyperpolarization (equivalent IPSP). Should b = 0.9
and the top values of the equivalent IPSP is 8 mV,
then the duration of the wave is about 100msec.
For the general case where equivalent EPSPs and
IPSPs are generated at the same time, Eqs. (2) and (3)
are combined by linear summation. The remaining
most important assumptions of the model are the
following:
The physiological properties of TCR and IN cells
were assumed to be identical due to lack of more specific
knowledge. The firing threshold of both was set at
6 mV above resting membrane potential. After firing,
the threshold changed up to the value of V~t and
decreased exponentially in order to simulate the

29

absolute and relative refractory periods. The absolute
refractory period lasted one time unit and the threshold
was reset at the original value within 3 time units.
It was assumed that one IN would receive effective
excitatory inputs from around a radius, r r, of about
150 la. Considering the known extent of the length of
the dendritic arborization of these cells, which is
about 250-400 ~t, this appeared to give a reasonable
approximation admitting a geometric scaling down
factor of 2 to take into account the effective action
of the input fibres. Lack of knowledge about the
number and length of the TCR axon's collaterals
makes it difficult to determine how many TCR cells
should project upon one IN. In the model we assumed
that any IN receives inputs from 32 surrounding
TCR cells.
The effective radius, re, of one IN was assumed to
be 100 ~t. This implies a scaling factor of 2 since that
the length of the dendrites of the TCR cells is only
200-250 la and that the precise length of the IN axons
is not known. In the model any IN projects upon
12 surrounding TCR cells. Therefore each TCR cell
receives inputs from 3 IN's considering that the ratio
between the number of cells TCR/IN is equal to 4.
We did not put into the model the spatial effects of
the relative effectiveness of synaptic inputs as a function
of their place along the somadendritic membrane.
The model had two main outputs:
the linear sum, over all cells, of the membrane potential;
and the density of all action potentials leaving the
network via the axons of the TCR cells.
In general, we took as the main output the sum of
the membrane potential of only the TCR cells since
these are the dominant components in number and
size. This signal is the modelled EEG which is, therefore, assumed to be extracellular replica of the membrane potential changes as a function of time.
The input to the model was fed only to the TCR
cells- at least in this phase of the research. We assumed
that the input was a randomly distributed series of
action potentials. The TCR cells received uncorrelated
inputs. Reports of spontaneous firing in the central
nervous system have shown that often these series of
action potentials possess a Poisson distribution.
On the basis of the fact that one TCR cell receives
about 10 extrinsic afferent fibres, we assumed that
each TCR cell received 200 action potentials per
second. To choose this value, we thought it useful to
look for the mean rate of the spontaneous discharge
occurring in optic tract fibres at rest or in darkness
since eye closure provides the most conspicuous
condition for the onset of alpha-rhythms.

signals. The power spectrum were computed by means of the Fast Fourier Transformation, and smoothingin the frequencydomain by an
elliptic window. The frequencyresolution is 1.2 Hz
In the literature, values around 20 action potentials
per second and per fibre have been reported for the
cat (Fuster et al., 1965; Levick and Williams, 1964).
A value of 20 action potentials per incoming fibre was,
therefore, chosen for the model. Since the time unit
in the model was set at 4 msec, we obtain a mean
value Ix = 0.8 action potentials per unit time and per
cell. This value was a parameter in our model, and it
was only assumed that it was not likely that spontaneously active afferent fibres would have much higher
rates of firing than indicated above.

Our purpose was to use the model in an attempt
to answer the following question: does the simulated
thalamic neural network generate a stochastic signal
with characteristics analogous to alpha-rhythms when
submitted to an appropriate noise input? Alpharhythms might then be considered as a form of
filtered noise where the filter would be the thalamic
network.

model's output)

potential analogous to an alpha-rhythm (see Fig. 3b).
The statistical properties of these oscillatory potentials
have been characterized by means of power spectra
and amplitude distributions (see Figs. 3 a-c). In Fig. 4
an example of dog's alpha-rhythm with corresponding
amplitude distribution and power spectra is presented
for comparison.
It can be seen that, in both cases, the real alpharhythm and the model's "alpha" present a frequency
of about 9-12 Hz. The simulated alpha-rhythm waxes
and wanes in amplitude, so that it may assume the
form of spindles. It should be noted that the amplitude
distribution is based on only a few seconds of activity
due to the fact that the model output had to be kept
as short as possible for technical reasons.
Without going into details of all simulations
which have been done we can state that the occurrence
of an alpha-rhythm, and its frequency and amplitude,
were mainly dependent on the mean value of the noise
input (mean rate of incoming action potentials) and
on the size of the IPSP. The effect of these two parameters is shown in Figs. 5 a, b. In this report we cannot
deal in detail with the influence of all parameters.

In conclusion, we consider that the simulations
support the hypothesis that alpha-rhythms are generated by neural networks with the characteristic of a
filter and a noise input.

2.1.2. The test of the hypothesis that several noise
sources contribute to thalamic and cortical alpharhythms and are responsible for thalamo-cortical
coherences. The coherence function between two
signals, Sl(t) and^S2(t), with estimates of power
spectra Pa(f) and P2(f) and of crosspower spectrum
Gt.2(f) is defined as
](~l : ( f ) I 2
.}z(f) = P~(f)'P2(f)"

(4)

The two signals may be expressed in the following way:
St (t) = xl (t) + y(t) and S 2(t) = x 2 (t) + y(t) where x 1(t),
x2(t) and y(t) are stochastic uncorrelated signals.
Accordingly the expression for the coherence between
S~(t) and Sz(t) can be written as follows:
~2(f) = 1/[-1 § (~'xl(f)/[~

+ (Px2(f)/Py(f))

+ [~xl (f)" [~x2 (f)/(~y(f))2].

Fig. 6. Three interconnected alpha-rhythm networks. Network T simulates a central thalamic area; networks C 1 and C2 simulate two cortical
projection areas. In this simulation the output of the TCR neurons of T furnishes 8 % of the action potentials forming the input of the main
neurons of network C1. These neurons receive also a superimposed but uncorrelated noise input. Network C2 receives three inputs which are
superimposed and which furnish the following contributions: 4% from T, 13 % from C j, and 839/oofrom an uncorrelated noise source. For all
the three networks the mean input is the same and equal to 200 pulses/sec per neuron. At the left-hand side the spectrograms of the alpharhythms generated by networks T, C1, and C2 are represented. The frequency scale is the same as for the coherence function on the right.
The vertical scale is in arbitrary units. Note that the spectra are practically identical and that all show a peak at the alpha frequency. At the
right-hand side the coherence between the three models alpha-rhythms are illustrated. Note the large coherence between C~ and C2
(0.85 at 10 Hz) whereas the maximal coherence between T and C~ is only 0.5 at 12 Hz and that between T and C2 is even only 0.49 at 8.5 Hz.
The differences between the C 1 - C2 coherences and the T - C~ or T - C2 coherences are statistically significant (p <0.05)

nected in series; (b) a more interesting possibility is
that a group of TCR cells of the first network projects
upon one cell of the second network. This gives a
better ratio between the secondary noise source and
the filtered noise. The main point which we wished
to investigate by means of this type of simulations was
whether it was possible to show that three interconnected networks may produce signals with similar
spectra whereas they have significantly different
degrees of coherence. In order to achieve this we set
up the three-order model represented in Fig. 6.
Network T, or thalamic model, was assumed as being
the common input to the two networks Ca and C2
representing cortical projection areas. The projection
of T upon C~ was made stronger than upon C2;
four TCR neurons of T projected upon one neuron
of C1 whereas only two TCR neurons projected upon
one neuron of C2. There was, of course, overlapping
between the domains of TCR neurons projecting to
one neuron of C1 or C2 since every network was
composed of the same number of neuronal elements.
The secondary noise sources of the two networks
(Ca and C2) which were necessary in order to obtain
equivalent input levels, were simulated in different
ways: network C1 received only a secondary uncorrelated noise source; network C2 received two
secondary inputs, namely the output of the main
neurons of network C1 and an uncorrelated noise
source.
The main results, of this simulation are illustrated
in Fig. 6. They can be summarized as follows: (a) it
was indeed found that the three networks produce
signals with spectra which are practically identical;
(b) however, the values of coherence between networks
T and C a or C 2 were significantly lower than those
found between networks Ct and C z. Therefore we
demonstrated that such a model simulates satisfactorily the finding that the thalamo-cortical coherences are smaller than cortico-cortical coherences.
The large value of the latter should be attributed to the
strong interconnections between the cortical areas.
It should be added that of course, we did not attempt
to simulate a cortical network in its histological
organization because of lack of the detailed information which is available for the thalamus. Thus the
cortical model should be envisaged only as a rough
approximation.
The conclusion which emerges from these simulations is that in order to obtain an alpha-rhythm in
such a system of neural networks as simulated here
a deterministic pacemaker is not necessary. However,
the strength of coherence between different brain
areas emanates from the existence of histological con-

nections between these areas and depends (a) upon the
arrangement of the neuronal projections from one
area on another, and (b) on the ratio between several
noise sources that they receive as inputs.

3. Systems Analysis of the Model
So far we have dealt with the alpha-rhythm model
in terms of the results obtained from simulations
conducted on the digital computer. It is, of course,
desirable to try to generalize the model so that we may
understand the influence of different parameters
analytically. We have treated this problem by simplifying the model and applying a systems analysis
approach. The basic treatment is inspired from the
theoretical study of Wilson and Cowan (1972) and
has been treated in detail elsewhere by Zetterberg
(1973). The basic system to which our computer
model reduces is shown in Fig. 7. The translation
from the model to the scheme of Fig. 7 takes into
account the following assumptions:
E(t) is the proportion of excitatory cells (TCR)
firing per unit of time and I(t) is the proportion of
inhibitory cells (IN) firing per unit of time; P(t) is
the pulse density fed into the excitatory subpopulation
of cells; Ve(t) is the average membrane potential in
the excitatory population at time t and V~(t) of the
inhibitory population; fe(x) and f~(x) are static functions (threshold functions) which relate the average
level of the membrane potential to the pulse density
of the excitatory and inh.ibitory cell populations,
respectively; e~ is a constant which may be inter-

Fig. 7. Block diagram for the simplified alpha-rhythm model. The
TCR neurons are represented by two input devices which have as
impulse responses potentials simulating an EPSP (he(t)) and an
IPSP (h~(t)), respectively. Furthermore a static non-linearity fe(V)
represents the spike generating process. The IN are represented
only by one input element having the impulse response he(t ) and
a spike generating process f~(V). The feedback from the TCR to
the IN is multiplied by two factors, namely C~ which represents the
number of INs to which one TCR neuron projects and C 2 which
represents the number of TCR neurons to which one IN projects

preted as the average number of synaptic contacts
that the output of one excitatory cell forms and the
same applies for % but for one inhibitory cell; he(t)
and hi(t) are the impulse responses for the excitatory
and inhibitory synapses. They may be viewed as the
equivalent to an excitatory postsynaptic potential
(EPSP) or an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP).
The non-linearity introduced by s
and fi(x) is
given in the following expressions:
E(t) = f~[ V~(t)]
I(t)

=f

[ V~(t)]

(6)

Ve(t) = f e - t [E(t)]

(8)

Vi(t) = fi- 1[I(t)].

(9)

The four stochastic processess E(t), l(t), Ve(t), and Vi(t)
are defined as spatial averages over a fairly large
population of cells. Hence it may be expected that
at a fixed time the standard deviations of these
quantities are small compared to the mean values.
For intermediate level of excitation it is reasonable to
assume that the two functions s
and f - l ( y )
may be expanded in a Taylor series around the mean
value
f f ' [E(t)] = aeo(E ) + a~x (E(t) - E) + a~2(E(t ) - ~)2
+ a~3(e(t ) - E) 3

where P(s), E(s), I(s), He(s), tti(s), V~(s) and Vi(s) are
the Laplace transform of p(t), e(t), fit), he(t), hi(t), re(t),
and vi(t) respectively.
Combining expressions (12) and (13) we obtain
the expression for Ve(S):

(10)

and similarly for f~-'[I(t)]. Here only the two first
terms will be taken into account. But basically we are
not interested in mean values but rather on variations
around the means of the stochastic processes E(t),
I(t), P~(t) and V~(t).
Therefore it is convenient to introduce the processes:
e(t) = E(t) - E.

We can now write the equations governing the operations indicated in the scheme of Fig. 7 applying
Laplace transforms:
P(s) I-I~(s) - C fl(s) ~ ( s ) = a~lE(S) = Ve(S)

where qe~ represents the slope of the function fi at
which gives the relationship between the number of
excitatory cells firing per unit of time [E(t)] and the
membrane potential Ve(t); for qil the same holds
for the inhibitory cells.
We get
P(s) He(s )
Ve(S)-~- I + C t C 2 q e l q i l l t i ( s ) He(S) "
(15)
At this stage we must make some assumptions about
the transfer functions Hi(s) and He(s ) which have
impulse responses equivalent to the inhibitory (IPSP)
and excitatory (EPSP) post-synaptic potentials, respectively. These transfer functions may be approximated by second order systems. The corresponding
impulse responses constitute an approximation of
the real post-synaptic potentials which are shown in
Fig. 2. In this case the impulse responses are given by
the expressions,
~(t) = B [ e x p ( - b I t) - e x p ( - b2t) ]

(16)

he(t) = A [ e x p ( - al t) - e x p ( - a 2 t)]

(17)

with a 2 > al and b 2 2>bv
The corresponding transfer functions are then
Hi(s) =

(b2 - b O B
(s + bl) (s + b2)

He(s)=

(s+al)(s+a2)

and

(18)

(a2 - al) A

(19)

The values of a 1, a2, b 1, b 2, A and B which were used
in the present simulations are given below.
Including these expressions in (15) and setting

we get

re(x) and fi(x) are monotonously increasing and
hence they have unique inverses. Thus we may write

Fig. 8. The influence of the feedback factor K (for explanation see
text) on the spectrum of the model's output. Note that if K is small
the spectrum is predominantly that of a low pass filter; as K increases
the spectrum acquires a clear selectivity at the alpha-frequency

In the constant K there are several factors; the
coupling constants C~ and C2; the threshold functions qel and qi~ and the parameters of the synaptic
responses.
If the coupling within the network is very small
than K is negligible and the transfer function of the
network expressed as

9p(s) = V~(s)/P(s)
approaches the transfer function for the EPSP.
As the coupling constant K increases complex
poles will originate. This is the most interesting case
for understanding the generation of rhythmic activity.
As K increases still more some poles will move into
the right half plane ( a > 0 ) and the network will
become unstable.
The power spectrum of V~(t) may be obtained from
expression (21) substituting s by jco and assuming
that P(s) is a constant since the spectrum of the input
noise is flat.
The influence of K on the power spectrum of
Ve(t) is shown in Fig. 8 for values of K corresponding
to stable solutions.

with a 1 =55, a 2 = 6 0 5 , b I =27.5, and b 2 =55 in sec -~
The constants A and B were calculated as indicated
below; the EPSP has a top value of 1.2mV so that
A = 1.65 mV and the IPSP has a top value of 8 mV
so that B = 32 mV.
For C~ and C2 we used the values obtained from
the simulations described in the preceding section;
C~ is the number of TCR cells which project upon one
IN and was set equal to 32; C2 was the number of IN
which project upon one TCR and was equal to 3.
Thus in order to get a value of K = 3.5 x 108 which
corresponds to the maximum in the spectrum we have
that qe 1qi ~ = 4.55 x 10 6. That value of K is close to the
stability limit of the network.
Considering for simplicity that qel ~ q i l which is
the case in our computer simulations we have that
qe ~ ~ 2130 which represents that, theoretically, 2.1 cells
would fire, per sec., as the average membrane potential
of the cell population increases by 1 mV. This has been
confirmed in the computer network simulations;
it should now be confirmed experimentally.
One of the very interesting aspects which emerged
from the model's system analysis is the study of the
influence of K. Indeed it is curious to note that the
family of spectra of Fig. 8 approximates the development of the EEG as function of age; in this way we
have obtained a useful model of the development of the
EEG. Considering that it is likely that the threshold
parameters, q~l and qi~ should not change much and
the synaptic time constants only slightly, it follows
that the main parameter which should change during
development would be C~ and C 2 i.e. the coupling
constants. Therefore it may be seen that the development of the EEG from a predominantly low frequency
spectrum signal to a signal with a clear rhythmic
component would depend upon an increase in interconnections and synaptic contacts.
In conclusion the systems analysis of the model
enables us to evaluate the influence of different
parameters upon the statistical properties of the
resulting rhythmic activity in an analytical form,
which is simpler than the computer simulations.
Furthermore it enables us to generalize the model to
other forms of cooperative processes in neural systems.

Glutamate Inhibits Thalamic Reticular Neurons

Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) can
result in long-lasting modulation of neuronal excitability. Multiple mGluR subtypes are localized within the rat thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), and we have examined the effects of activating these different receptor subtypes on the excitability of
these neurons using an in vitro slice preparation. Typical of
most mGluR-sensitive preparations, the general mGluR agonist, (Ϯ)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid
(ACPD) produced a robust, long-lasting excitatory response.
Surprisingly, ACPD produced a membrane hyperpolarization in
some neurons. Using selective mGluR agonists, we found that
activation of group II mGluRs produces the hyperpolarization,

whereas the depolarization is mediated by group I mGluRs.
While the polarity of the postsynaptic response (hyperpolarization vs depolarization) was dependent on the mGluR subtype
activated, both actions appear to result from modification of a
linear K ϩ conductance. The inhibitory action of Glutamate, via
group II mGluRs, provides an avenue for a disinhibitory effect
that could have interesting consequences upon a wellinvestigated, model neuronal circuit, turning its assumed functional role upside down.

The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) consists of a thin layer of
GABA-containing neurons that forms a shell predominantly lateral to the dorsal thalamus (Jones, 1985). All axons communicating between thalamus and cortex in both directions pass through
and innervate the TRN. Because TRN neurons provide a powerful inhibitory input to thalamocortical relay cells, they are
strategically situated to influence the responsiveness of thalamic
relays (Cox et al., 1997; K im et al., 1997; Sanchez-Vives et al.,
1997). The activity of TRN neurons has been associated with
various f unctions, including the regulation of receptive field sizes
(Lee et al., 1994a,b) and the generation of synchronized oscillations among thalamic neurons during certain phases of sleep and
forms of epilepsy (Steriade et al., 1986, 1993; Avoli et al., 1990;
Buzsa´ki et al., 1990). Much of the afferent input to TRN derives
from collaterals of both corticothalamic and thalamocortical axons, which are glutamatergic and thus have been widely assumed
to be purely excitatory. Thus, most views of TRN are based on the
idea that it provides a feedback inhibitory input to dorsal thalamus (i.e., being excited by glutamatergic relay cell axons and
projecting back to these relay cells) and a feedforward inhibitory
input from cortex (i.e., being excited by glutamatergic corticothalamic axons and projecting to thalamic relay cells).
Glutamate can activate multiple subtypes of both ionotropic
and metabotropic receptors, primarily leading to EPSPs in the
CNS. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)
is of increasing interest, because such activation through
G-protein-coupled, second messenger pathways stereotypically
produce long-lasting changes in neuronal excitability, in contrast
to the relatively short-lasting actions of activating ionotropic
glutamate receptors (iGluRs) (Watkins and Evans, 1981; Conn
and Pin, 1997). At least eight subtypes of mGluRs have been

identified, and they are currently differentiated into three primary
groups based on pharmacology, structural homology, and signal
transduction mechanism (Nakanishi, 1992; Conn and Pin, 1997).
Different mGluR subtypes have been associated with a variety of
presynaptic and postsynaptic actions in many CNS regions
(Watkins and Evans, 1981; Collingridge and Lester, 1989; Schoepp and Conn, 1993; Conn and Pin, 1997). Whereas activation of
mGluRs usually results in a postsynaptic excitation (Charpak et
al., 1990; Mercuri et al., 1993; Davies et al., 1995; Eaton and Salt,
1996; Lee and McCormick, 1997; Turner and Salt, 1998), several
studies have indicated that mGluR activation may also produce a
postsynaptic inhibitory response (Shirasaki et al., 1994; Holmes et
al., 1996; Fiorillo and Williams, 1998). More specifically, activation of group II mGluRs produces a postsynaptic inhibitory
response in basolateral amygdala (Holmes et al., 1996). This is of
particular interest, because recent immunohistochemical evidence suggests that TRN cells possess several distinct types of
mGluR (Ohishi et al., 1993a,b). The presence of group II
mGluRs in particular suggest the possibility of glutamatergic
inhibition of TRN cells, thereby dramatically changing our ideas
of the functional circuitry involving TRN. We sought to test this
possibility by pharmacological investigation of TRN cells in an in
vitro thalamic slice preparation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Thalamic slices were prepared as previously described (Cox et al., 1998).
Briefly, young Sprague Dawley rats (P10 –P18) were deeply anesthetized
with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg / kg), and the brains were quickly
removed. Tissue slices (300 –350 ␮m) were cut in the horizontal plane
using a vibratome in cold, oxygenated slicing medium containing (in
mM): 2.5 KC l, 1.25 NaH2PO4 , 10.0 MgC l2 , 0.5 C aC l2 , 26.0 NaHC O3 ,
11.0, glucose and 234.0 sucrose. Slices were transferred to a holding
chamber containing oxygenated (5% C O2 and 95% O2 ) physiological
solution that contained (in mM): 126.0 NaC l, 2.5 KC l, 1.25 NaH2PO4 , 2.0
MgC l2 , 2.0 C aC l2 , 26.0 NaHC O3 , and 10.0 glucose for at least 1 hr
before recording. Individual slices were then transferred to a recording
chamber maintained at 30 Ϯ 1°C, and oxygenated physiological saline
was continuously superf used at a rate of 3 ml /min.
Whole-cell recordings were obtained from visually identified thalamic

reticular neurons with differential interference contrast optics and infrared video microscopy. An Axoclamp2A amplifier (Axon Instruments,
Foster C ity, CA) was used in bridge mode for voltage recordings and
discontinuous single electrode voltage-clamp mode for current recordings. In voltage-clamp recordings, switching frequencies ranged from 3 to
4 kHz with a gain of 300 – 800 pA /mV, and the headstage was continually
monitored to ensure that the current transient had completely decayed
before voltage measurements. Voltage-clamp recordings were limited to
neurons that had a stable access resistance of Ͻ25 M⍀. No correction for
liquid junction potential has been made to the voltage measurements.
Recording pipettes were pulled from 1.5 mm outer diameter capillary
tubing and filled with the following intracellular solution (in mM): 117 K
gluconate, 13 KC l, 1.0 MgC l2 , 0.07 C aC l2 , 0.1 EGTA, 10.0 H EPES, 2.0
Na2-ATP, and 0.4 Na-GTP. In some experiments, C s-gluconate and
C sC l were substituted for K-gluconate and KC l, respectively, to suppress
K ϩ-mediated conductances. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.3
using KOH or C sOH, and osmolality was adjusted to 280 mosm with
distilled water.
Concentrated stock solutions of pharmacological agents were prepared
in either distilled water or 0.1 M NaOH and diluted in physiological
solution to final concentrations before use. Agonists were applied by
injecting a bolus into the flow line of the chamber over 20 – 60 sec using
a motorized syringe pump. Based on the rate of agonist injection and
chamber perf usion, the final bath concentration of agonists were estimated to be approximately one-fourth of the concentration introduced in
the flow line (Cox et al., 1995). Concentrations listed in the text are the
concentrations of the injected agent before the fourfold dilution in the
bath. Antagonists were diluted to a final concentration from concentrated stocks and bath-applied. All compounds were purchased from
Tocris Cookson (St. L ouis, MO) or Sigma (St. L ouis, MO).

RESULTS
Current-clamp recordings of rat TRN neurons associated with
the ventrobasal complex (the primary somatosensory thalamic
relay) revealed that the general mGluR agonist (Ϯ)-1aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (AC PD; 125–250
␮M) produced a long-lasting robust depolarization (mean Ϯ SD;
9.4 Ϯ 5.8 mV; n ϭ 11) that could result in action potential
discharge (Fig. 1 A). The AC PD-mediated depolarization was
associated with an increase in input resistance and persisted in
the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 ␮M), suggesting that activation of postsynaptic mGluRs on the recorded cell underlies the
alteration in membrane potential (Fig. 1 A). Given that ACPD is
a general agonist for both group I and II mGluR subtypes,
specific mGluR agonists were then tested on TRN neurons. The
selective group I agonist (RS)-3,5-dihroxyphenylglycine (DHPG;
250 –500 ␮M) with and without TTX (1 ␮M) also produced a
strong depolarization with an increased input resistance similar
to that seen with AC PD (Fig. 1 B). At these concentrations
(250 –500 ␮M), suprathreshold depolarizations were commonly
observed.
In contrast, the selective group II agonist S-3-carboxy-4hydroxyphenylglycine (S3-C4HPG; 500 –2000 ␮M) produced a
small amplitude membrane hyperpolarization in TRN cells (Fig.
1C). This hyperpolarization was observed in 18 of 26 neurons and
had an average peak amplitude of 1.5 Ϯ 0.6 mV (range, 0.9 –3.2
mV). It also persisted in TTX (1 ␮M), suggesting a postsynaptic
action (Fig. 1C). We also saw some evidence for a slight decrease
in input resistance during these current-clamp recordings, but the
changes were small, variable, and often unreliable. We thus chose
the more sensitive technique of measuring current responses to
ramped command voltages during voltage-clamp recording to
obtain a more reliable measure of changed input resistance, and
this is described below.
Further support of this hyperpolarizing action of group II
mGluR activation was provided by a different agent, (2S,1ЈR,
2ЈR,3ЈR)-2-(2Ј,3Ј-dicarboxycyclopropyl)-glycine (DCG IV), a po-

These examples reflect current-clamp recording. A, Control, ACPD (125
␮M, thick line under recording) produces a long-lasting membrane depolarization leading to spike discharge (spikes truncated). The depolarization is interrupted for 20 –30 sec by current injection to repolarize the
membrane to the pre-AC PD level (Ϫ70 mV), thereby controlling for any
voltage-dependent effects while comparing pre-AC PD and post-ACPD
input resistance. During the depolarization, there is an increase in baseline activity, presumably representing EPSPs originating from suprathreshold excitation by the AC PD of afferent glutamatergic inputs (e.g.,
from ventrobasal relay cells that are generally connected the TRN neurons in these slice preparation). A, T T X, With addition of TTX (1 ␮M),
the AC PD-mediated depolarization persists, but the increase in baseline
activity is eliminated as are, of course, the action potentials. In both

resistance. B, Control, In a different TRN neuron, the group I mGluR
agonist DHPG (250 ␮M) produces a robust depolarization, evoking action

TTX (1 ␮M). As in A, the larger voltage responses to hyperpolarizing

tent agonist of group II mGluRs that also activates NMDA receptors. Similar to S3-C4HPG, DCG IV (100 ␮M) produced an initial
hyperpolarization, followed by a robust, AP-5-sensitive depolarization as predicted by the mixed action of this agonist on both
group II mGluRs and NMDA receptors (n ϭ 4; data not shown).

Figure 2. Biphasic actions of AC PD on TRN cells. A, Control, In control
conditions during current-clamp recording, AC PD (125 ␮M) produces a
depolarization associated with a large increase in spontaneous depolarizations (presumed EPSPs), and action potentials are evoked. The depolarization is interrupted by a manual return of the membrane voltage to
the pre-ACPD level of Ϫ63 mV. A, T T X, With the addition of TTX (1
␮M), ACPD produces an early hyperpolarization with reduced input
resistance followed by a longer lasting depolarization with increased input
resistance. B, Control, In a voltage-clamp recording from a different
neuron, ACPD (125 ␮M) produces an inward current associated with an
increase in small inward currents, which are presumed EPSCs. B, T T X,
With the addition of TTX (1 ␮M), AC PD no longer produces an increase
in baseline activity but does evoke an initial outward current followed by
a longer-lasting inward current. See legend to Figure 3 for explanation of
the downward deflections during the voltage-clamp recording.

In three neurons, AC PD produced an apparent biphasic action.
That is, in control conditions AC PD produced the typical membrane depolarization associated with an increased baseline activity (Fig. 2 A). However, in TTX (1 ␮M), AC PD produced an
initial relatively brief hyperpolarization that was followed by a
longer lasting depolarization (Fig. 2 A, T T X ). Similarly, voltageclamp recordings from a different neuron indicate that, in control
conditions, AC PD produced a net inward current as expected by
group I mGluR activation (Fig. 2 B). When TTX (1 ␮M) was
added to the preparation for this neuron, AC PD produced a
short-lasting outward current that was followed by a longer lasting
inward current (Fig. 2 B, T T X ). Furthermore, during the initial
outward current there is an increase in the current response to
the ramped voltage commands (Fig. 2 B, downward deflections)
indicative of an increased conductance, and the opposite is observed during the inward current (decreased membrane response). These data indicate that both the group I and II mGluRmediated responses can occur in the same TRN neurons, and
furthermore they can be elicited by the general mGluR agonist.
To f urther investigate the mechanisms underlying the mGluRmediated membrane potential changes, voltage-clamp recordings
using ramped voltage commands (Ϫ50 to Ϫ90 mV) were used to
quantif y alterations in input conductance. In control conditions,
ACPD produced a net inward current that had an average peak
of 67.0 Ϯ 32.0 pA (n ϭ 10) that persisted in 1 ␮M TTX (Fig. 3Ai).
During the AC PD-induced inward current, the slope of the
current response to the ramped voltage commands was signifi-

cantly decreased, reflecting a reduction in input conductance
( p Ͻ 0.05; paired Student’s t test; n ϭ 6; Fig. 3Aii). This decreased conductance averaged 0.69 Ϯ 0.55 nS (range, 0.06 –1.49
nS), accounting for a 1–15% reduction in resting conductance.
The ACPD-altered current appears linear over the tested voltage
range (Ϫ50 to Ϫ90 mV) and reversed near EK , indicating that
ACPD likely decreases a Kleak conductance (Fig. 3Aiii). Similarly,
the group I agonist DHPG also produced a TTX-insensitive
inward current (Fig. 3Bi) associated with a significant reduction of
a conductance that reverses near EK (Fig. 3Bii,iii; p Ͻ 0.05; n ϭ 5).
In contrast, the selective group II mGluR agonist S3-C4HPG
produced a TTX-insensitive outward current (Fig. 3Ci; 20.2 Ϯ
17.0 pA; n ϭ 13; range, 7–73 pA). The S3-C4HPG outward
current was associated with a significant increase in resting membrane conductance ( p Ͻ 0.05; n ϭ 10; Fig. 3Cii). This increased
conductance averaged 0.48 Ϯ 0.49 nS (range, 0.07–1.74 nS) accounting for a 1–18% increase in resting conductance. This current appears linear and also reverses near EK , suggesting group II
mGluR activation increases a Kleak conductance (Fig. 3Ciii).
Thus, although our data are consistent with the possibility that
activation of group I or II mGluRs alters an apparent, single
linear K ϩ conductance, we do not have the data necessary to
determine whether this is a single conductance involving one
group of K ϩ channels or multiple conductances and K ϩ channel
types. Nonetheless, our experiments indicate that the direction of
the conductance change (increase or decrease) is dependent on
the mGluR subtype activated.
The role of mGluRs mediating this hyperpolarization was
further supported by the reversible antagonism of the S3C4HPG-mediated hyperpolarization by the general mGluR antagonist (RS)-␣-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), as illustrated in Figure 4 A (n ϭ 3). In addition, because the voltageclamp recordings suggest that activation of either group I or II
mGluRs alters K ϩ conductances, Cs ϩ-containing recording pipettes were used to suppress K ϩ currents. As Figure 4 B illustrates, the ACPD-mediated inward current was absent or very
small in these recording conditions (n ϭ 6). Furthermore, the
S3-C4HPG-induced outward current was also absent (n ϭ 3).

DISCUSSION
Our results thus indicate that glutamate can produce postsynaptic
inhibitory responses in TRN cells in addition to the typical
excitatory action that has been described in many preparations.
This inhibition occurs through activation of group II mGluRs,
which hyperpolarizes TRN neurons by increasing a linear K ϩ
conductance, whereas activation of group I mGluRs suppresses a
K ϩ conductance resulting in a membrane depolarization. Although the predominant action of the general agonist ACPD is a
depolarization, a biphasic action of mGluR activation can occur
within some TRN neurons, suggesting the presence of both
receptor subtypes on these cells. Furthermore, although all TRN
neurons tested produced the group I mGluR mediated depolarization, approximately two-thirds also exhibited the group IImediated hyperpolarization. This difference suggests that group
II mGluRs are differentially distributed on TRN neurons or
perhaps that all TRN cells possess group II mGluR activity, but
that for some, the level of activity is insufficient to be detected by
our somatic recordings.
In any case, our findings indicate that activation of glutamatergic inputs to many TRN cells from thalamocortical and/or corticothalamic axons can provide both excitatory and inhibitory

Cox and Sherman • Glutamate Inhibits Thalamic Reticular Neurons

influences depending on the specific glutamate receptors activated. Of obvious importance is whether endogenous activation
of these different mGluR subtypes is specific to particular glutamatergic afferents, such as a subset of corticothalamic and/or
thalamocortical axons. A precedent for such specificity exists in
thalamus for glutamatergic inputs. For example, activation of
group I mGluRs on relay neurons, which produces long-lasting
EPSPs, appears specific to the corticothalamic pathway and not
the retinogeniculate, both of which are glutamatergic (McCormick and von Krosigk, 1992; Godwin et al., 1996).
Thus, the overall, sustained influence of activating these two
mGluR subtypes (groups I and/or II) by synaptically released
glutamate on the excitability of TRN neurons remains unknown.
We assume that iGluRs activated by these glutamatergic inputs
provide relatively fast EPSPs, and given evidence elsewhere that
mGluR activation requires higher afferent activity than does
activation of iGluRs (McCormick and von Krosigk, 1992), there
could be an interesting frequency-dependent effect in which certain corticothalamic or thalamocortical inputs to TRN cells begin
to inhibit these cells only when relatively active. Also, the more
sustained effects of mGluR activation would last well beyond
iGluR activation. We suggest three different possibilities that
require further investigation. First, individual glutamatergic afferents can activate both group I and II mGluRs, leading to a
predominant excitatory response that negates small hyperpolarizing actions. Second, individual glutamatergic afferents may activate only group I or II mGluRs. If those activating group II
mGluRs do not activate iGluRs, the postsynaptic effect would be
pure inhibition, and even if they did activate both receptor types
the mGluR-mediated inhibition would outlast the iGluRmediated excitation. Third, a given axon may synapse on both
group I and II mGluRs, but activation of these different subtypes
may be differentially frequency-dependent, with one effect dominating at lower levels of afferent activity, and the other, at higher
levels.
Although the functional significance of endogenous glutamate
release on mGluRs remains unanswered, our data suggest several
hypotheses that need further investigation. Clearly, TRN cells

sense, “specific” refers to certain afferents and/or certain patterns
of afferent activity.) Our data thus indicate that significant inhibition may also result from corticothalamic and/or thalamocortical inputs to TRN cells. If so, then ideas of TRN functioning and
control by these glutamatergic afferents are more complex and
richer than previously thought.

et al., 1997). As noted above, all previous ideas of TRN functioning were based on the belief that corticothalamic and thalamocortical axon collaterals, which form a major input to TRN
neurons, strictly excite these cells. The fact of group II-mediated
inhibition of TRN cells raises the possibility that specific inputs
from cortex or dorsal thalamus can inhibit TRN cells. (In this

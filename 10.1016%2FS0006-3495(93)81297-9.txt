ABSTRACT We investigated a simplified model of a thalamocortical cell and a reticular thalamic cell interconnected with
excitatory and inhibitory synapses, based on Hodgkin-Huxley type kinetics. The intrinsic oscillatory properties of the model cells
were similar to those observed from single cells in vitro. When synaptic interactions were included, spindle oscillations were
observed consisting of sequences of rhythmic oscillations at 8-10 Hz separated by silent periods of 8-40 s. The model suggests
that Ca2+ regulation of /h channels may be responsible for the waxing and waning of spindles and that the reticular cell shapes
the 1 0-Hz rhythmicity. The model also predicts that the kinetics of y-aminobutyric acid inhibitory postsynaptic potentials as well
as the intrinsic properties of reticular cells are critical in determining the frequency of spindle rhythmicity.

INTRODUCTION
Spindle oscillations are waxing and waning 7-14-Hz waves
that originate in the thalamus during slow-wave sleep in
mammals (reviewed in Steriade and Deschenes, 1984; Steriade and Llin'as, 1988). Recently, spindle oscillations have
also been demonstrated in vitro from thalamic slices that
include thalamocortical (TC) and reticular (RE) thalamic
cells (von Krosigk et al., 1993). These in vitro spindles consisted of sequences of 5-9-Hz rhythmic bursting separated by
silent periods of 3-30 s. The occurrence of these spindles
depended critically on the presence of the synaptic connections between TC and RE cells.
Single thalamic neurons have intrinsic properties which
include spontaneous oscillatory behavior. Cat and rat TC
neurons display spontaneous slow oscillations in the 8 frequency range (0.5-4 Hz) (Leresche et al., 1991; McCormick
and Pape, 1990; Curro Dossi et al., 1992). In cat relay cells,
waxing and waning slow oscillations (0.5-3.2 Hz) can appear
as bursts separated by silent periods of about 5-25 s and have
been called "spindle-like oscillations" (Leresche et al.,
1991), although they differ from spindles in many respects.
Rodent RE cells also display rhythmic oscillations at 7-12
Hz after injection of current pulses (Avanzini et al., 1989; Bal
and McCormick, 1993). These various types of oscillations
are resistant to tetrodotoxin due to mechanisms intrinsic to
the cell.
The intrinsic properties of TC and RE cells are difficult to
reconcile with the 6-9-Hz spindle oscillations observed in
the same neurons when their interconnections were pre-

served. The neurons are part of a neuronal network: the TC
cells make excitatory synapses on RE cells, which in turn
make inhibitory synapses back onto TC cells as well as on
other RE cells. In this paper, we investigate the effects of
synaptic interactions on these intrinsic oscillatory properties
and analyze the conditions that produce oscillations in the
frequency range of spindling.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The TC cell and the RE thalamic cell were modeled by single compartments
of 1000 ,um2 and Hodgkin-Huxley type of kinetics for the intrinsic currents.

where VT and VR are the membrane potentials of the TC and RE cells,
respectively; Cm = 1 ptF/cm2 is the specific capacity of the membrane; gL
= 0.05 mS/cm2 is the leakage conductance; ET = -86 mV and ER = -80
mV are the leakage reversal potentials.
Thalamic neurons are characterized by numerous voltage-dependent currents (Jahnsen and Llinas, 1984), but our goal was to find the minimal
number of ionic mechanisms that account for spindling. These currents were
the low-threshold Ca21 currents IT and ITS, the hyperpolarization-activated
current Ih, the Ca2+-activated currents IK[Ca] and IcAN, the fast Na+ and K+
currents INa and IK responsible for the generation of action potentials, and
the synaptic currents IGABA and IGLUEach of these currents was modeled by

where 6i is the maximal conductance of the current Ij; m and h are the
activation and inactivation variables, respectively; M and N are their respective (integer) exponents; V represents either VT or VR; and Ei is the
reversal potential.
Synaptic currents were modeled by a kinetic scheme for the binding of
neurotransmitter to postsynaptic receptors (Destexhe et al., 1994) (M = 1
and N = 0 in Eq. 3). The fraction of postsynaptic receptors in the open state,

occurred. This method for computing synaptic currents is more realistic than
the traditional a function, and it naturally handles summation of PSPs

(Destexhe et al., 1994).
For the TC cell, the kinetic equations used for describing the activation
and inactivation variables of the currents have already been described (Destexhe et al., 1993a) and the same model was used here. The IT kinetics were
taken from Wang et al. (1991), and Ih was based on the model of Destexhe
and Babloyantz (1993) to which a regulation by intracellular Ca2l was
added (Destexhe et al., 1993a).
For the RE cell, ITS was taken from the voltage clamp data of Huguenard
and Prince (1992) using M = 2 and N = 1. Two Ca2+-dependent currents,
the slow K+ current, IK[Cal, and the slow nonspecific cation current, IcAN
affected the oscillatory properties of RE cells (Bal and McCormick, 1993).
They are modeled here as voltage-independent currents described by Eq. 3
with M = 2 and N = 0, similar to Yamada et al. (1989) in bullfrog sympathetic ganglion cells. The activation variable m obeys
m

a[Ca]2(1 - m) -,m

where a and ,B are rate constants and [Ca] is the intracellular calcium
concentration. Adjustment of the kinetics of these currents to the current
clamp data of RE neurons (Bal and McCormick, 1993) gives a = 48 ms-1
mM-2, (3 = 0.03 ms-1 forKt[Ca], and a = 20 ms-I mM-2, 3 0.002 ms-1
for IcANFor both cells, action potentials were modeled by INa and IK, as described
in Traub and Miles (1991); and intracellular Ca2+ clearance was due to a
Ca2+ pump, as described in Destexhe et al. (1993a).
All simulations were performed using NEURON (Hines, 1993) with the
following values for the maximal conductances and reversal potentials:
gCa = 1.75 mS/cm2 for IT and for ITS, and in both cases, ECa was obtained
from the Nernst relation assuming an external Ca2+ concentration of 2 mM;
gh = 0.12 mS/cm2 and Eh = -43 mV for Ih; gK[Ca] = 10 mS/cm2 and
EK =-95 mV for IK[ca]; gCAN = 0.25 mS/cm2 and ECAN= -20 mV for
ICAN; gNa = 100 mS/cm2 in RE and 30 mS/cm2 in TC with ENa = 50 mV;
gK = 10 mS/cm2 in RE and 2 mS/cm2 in TC for IK; gGLU = 1 nS and EGLU
= 0 mV for IGLU; gGABA = 4 nS and EGABA = -80 mV for IGABA. The rate
constants used for computing synaptic currents were a = 2 ms-1 mM-1, (3
= 1 ms` for glutamate receptors and a = 2 ms-1 mM-', (3 = 0.1 ms'I for
GABA receptors in Eq. 4.

RESULTS
We first describe the properties of single neurons. In isolated
TC cells in vitro, IT and Ih currents produce slow oscillations
(McCormick and Pape, 1990; Soltesz et al., 1991) or waxing
and waning slow oscillations (Soltesz et al., 1991). In our
model, both types of oscillations were present depending on
the level of the membrane potential and the maximal conductance of Ih (Destexhe et al., 1993a) (Fig. 1 A-C). The
waxing and waning of the slow oscillations occurs as intracellular Ca2' binds progressively to Ih channels leading to
the cessation of oscillatory behavior and the emergence of a
silent period during which the system recovers before oscillations start again (Destexhe et al., 1993a).
In the isolated RE cell, the currents ITs, IK[Ca] and ICAN
reproduced the basic 10-Hz rhythmic burst firing found in
these cells in vitro (Avanzini et al., 1989; Bal and McCormick, 1993). Fig. 1 D shows a sequence of 8-12-Hz rhythmic
bursts in a RE cell in response to a strong hyperpolarizing
current pulse. These oscillations are driven by the interaction
between IT, and IK[Ca]. During the oscillations, IcANacti-

vated progressively and elicited a short period of tonic activity at the end of the oscillatory sequence.
The connections between the TC and the RE cell are indicated in Fig. 2 A. The two synapses were modeled by the
kinetic scheme described in Materials and Methods. IGABA
and IGLU represent the GABAA synaptic current (inhibitory
synapse from RE to TC) and the glutamate non-N-methylD-aspartate current (excitatory synapse from RE to TC), respectively, as identified in ferret thalamic slices (von Krosigk
et al., 1993). The PSPs corresponding to thcse currents are
shown in Fig. 2 B.
With the TC and RE cells interconnected (Fig. 2 A), sequences of 8-10-Hz spindle oscillations were observed (Fig.
2 C). These 8-10-Hz spindles occurred when the TC cell
displayed intrinsic waxing and waning oscillations. The
spindle sequence consisted of bursts of 8-10-Hz oscillations
lasting a few seconds and separated by silent periods of 8-40
s. The spindle oscillations began in the TC cell in a manner
very similar to the waxing and waning slow oscillations of
isolated TC cells (compare with Fig. 1 B). As the oscillation
began, the first burst of spikes in the TC cell elicited a series
of excitatory PSPs which activated ITs in the RE cell. The RE
cell started 8-10-Hz bursting and entrained the TC cell to this
oscillation, but the feedback of the TC cell was necessary to
maintain the 8-10-Hz rhythmicity. At each cycle of the oscillation, Ca2' bound to the Ih channels in the TC cell and
shifted the voltage activation curve for Ih, leading to the
cessation of oscillations in a manner similar to the waxing
and waning slow oscillations in isolated TC cells (see
Destexhe et al., 1993a).
The spindle oscillation rode on a depolarizing envelope in
the RE cells and a hyperpolarizing envelope in the TC cell
(Fig. 2 C). Such a mirror image between the two types of
cells is characteristic of intracellular recordings made in
anesthetized cats in vivo (Steriade and Llinas, 1988) and in
ferret slices in vitro (von Krosigk et al., 1993).
The generation of spindle oscillations depended on the
magnitudes of the synaptic conductances. If the glutamatergic or GABAergic conductances were too low, the coupling
was insufficient to produce a spindle; if the GABAergic conductance was to high, the system produced a sustained 10-Hz
oscillation because the strong hyperpolarization of the TC
cells prevented the Ca2+-bound Ih channels to terminate the
oscillation; if the glutamatergic conductance was too high,
the rapid depolarization of the RE cell led to a rapid burst and
a higher frequency of oscillation.
Previous in vitro results demonstrated that blockade of
GABAA synapses by application of bicuculline transformed
the spindle behavior by slowing down the frequency to 2-4
Hz (von Krosigk et al., 1993). Application of a GABAB receptor antagonist abolished these slowed oscillations, indicating that they were mediated by GABAB IPSPs. We could
reproduce a similar type of behavior in the model by slowing
down the decay of the GABA synaptic current. The results
summarized in Table 1 show that the decay of inhibition (,B
in Eq. 4) affects the frequency of the spindle oscillations. The

slower the decay, the lower the frequency, reaching a value
close to 3 Hz when the decay was within range the decay time
of GABAB currents (estimated from Otis et al., 1993).
The frequency of spindling depends not only on the decay
of IPSPs, but also on the intrinsic properties of the RE cell.
In the model of a single RE cell, blocking IcAN resulted in
a marked slowing down of the frequency of oscillation (not
shown here). When ICAN was blocked in the coupled system
during spindle oscillations, the frequency also decreased

markedly (Table 1). In addition, there was an increase of the
burst after hyperpolarization in the RE cell (not shown).

DISCUSSION
Our simplified model of two thalamic neurons is limited in
several respects, because only the primary intrinsic currents
were included to account for the main features of the oscillatory properties of these cells, as determined by in vitro

recordings. Spatial integration within the dendrites of RE
cells could be important for the generation of their bursting
behavior (Contreras et al., 1993), but dendrites were not included in the model. Nonetheless, the model exhibited many
of the properties observed from intracellular recordings of
these cells during spindling.
At the single-cell level, our model of the TC cell shows
that two currents, IT and Ih, can organize various types of
slow oscillatory behavior (Destexhe et al., 1993a). In the RE
cell, the combination of IT and IK[CaJ can generate robust
oscillation (Wang and Rinzel 1993) and we have observed
the same basic behavior with different models of these two

currents. In addition, we have found that the magnitude of
IcAN controls the frequency of the rhythmic bursting in the
range of 8-10 Hz.
At the network level, the simple model presented here
allowed us to identify the key elements which may be responsible for 8-10 Hz spindling. (a) The slow repetition rate
of spindling (0.025-0.1 Hz) is due to mechanisms intrinsic
to the TC cell, as shown elsewhere for the waxing and waning
slow oscillations (Destexhe et al., 1993a). (b) The spindle
starts in the TC cell, due to intrinsic oscillatory properties of
these neurons. (c) The termination of the spindle is due to the
Ca2+-induced shift in the voltage dependence of Ih. (d) The
frequency of spindling (7-14 Hz) is determined by the intrinsic properties of RE cells, as shown by the slower frequency of spindling obtained after blocking ICAN in the RE
cell. The frequency of spindling also depends on the kinetics
of IPSPs generated by the RE cells, but the maintenance of
the oscillation requires the excitatory feedback from TC
cells. Therefore, in this model, spindle oscillations are due
to the interplay of the intrinsic properties of both types of
cells, similar to a suggestion of McCormick (1992).
The model makes several predictions that could be tested
from intracellular recordings of TC cells during spindling.
First, during the silent period, the membrane should slowly
hyperpolarize by a few millivolts. This has already been
shown to be a characteristic of waxing and waning slow
oscillations in vitro (Leresche et al., 1991). Second, because
spindle termination in the model depends on the Ca2' regulation of Ih in TC cells, spindle waves should be sensitive to
the alteration of either Ih or intracellular Ca2+. Third, the

Destexhe et al.

frequency of spindle rhythmicity should depend on the kinetics of the decay phase of inhibitory synaptic currents.
Finally, the model predicted that the frequency of spindling
also depends on the intrinsic properties of the RE cell. Selectively blocking IcAN resulted in a slowing down of the
spindle frequency.
Our model of a single pair of interconnected TC and RE
cells lacks the variability observed in the thalamus itself,
although it could, in principle, be tested with tissue culture
experiments similar to those based on excised and cultured
invertebrate neurons (Kleinfeld et al., 1990; Nicholls and
Hernandez, 1989; Syed et al., 1990). Nonetheless, the model
may provide the kernel of the mechanism that underlies spindling in a network or TC and RE cells. The spatial distribution and the probabilistic nature of real spindling await an
appropriate network model (Destexhe et al., 1993c). Such a
model should also consider the interactions between RE
cells, which constitutes another possible generator of spindle
rhythmicity (Destexhe et al., 1993b; Steriade et al., 1987;
Wang and Rinzel, 1993).

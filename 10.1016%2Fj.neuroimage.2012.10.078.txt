This paper presents a dynamic causal model based upon neural ﬁeld models of the Amari type. We consider
the application of these models to non-invasive data, with a special focus on the mapping from source activity
on the cortical surface to a single channel. We introduce a neural ﬁeld model based upon the canonical microcircuit (CMC), in which neuronal populations are assigned to different cortical layers. We show that
DCM can disambiguate between alternative (neural mass and ﬁeld) models of cortical activity. However,
unlike neural mass models, DCM with neural ﬁelds can address questions about neuronal microcircuitry
and lateral interactions. This is because they are equipped with interlaminar connections and horizontal
intra-laminar connections that are patchy in nature. These horizontal or lateral connections can be regarded
as connecting macrocolumns with similar feature selectivity. Crucially, the spatial parameters governing horizontal connectivity determine the separation (width) of cortical macrocolumns. Thus we can estimate the
width of macro columns, using non-invasive electromagnetic signals. We illustrate this estimation using dynamic causal models of steady-state or ongoing spectral activity measured using magnetoencephalography
(MEG) in human visual cortex. Speciﬁcally, we revisit the hypothesis that the size of a macrocolumn is a
key determinant of neuronal dynamics, particularly the peak gamma frequency. We are able to show a
correlation, over subjects, between columnar size and peak gamma frequency — that ﬁts comfortably with
established correlations between peak gamma frequency and the size of visual cortex deﬁned retinotopically.
We also considered cortical excitability and assessed its relative inﬂuence on observed gamma activity. This
example highlights the potential utility of dynamic causal modelling and neural ﬁelds in providing quantitative characterisations of spatially extended dynamics on the cortical surface — that are parameterised in
terms of horizontal connections, implicit in the cortical micro-architecture and its synaptic parameters.

Introduction
This work combines neural ﬁeld models — that model the activity of
layers of cells in cortical patches — with a Bayesian framework for
optimising model parameters — known as Dynamic Causal Modelling
(DCM). This combination allows one to address questions about lateral
cortical interactions in terms of optimal models and model parameters.
DCM has been applied extensively to fMRI and electrophysiological
data (David et al., 2006; Friston et al., 2003; Penny et al., 2004) and
has been used recently to model spatiotemporal dynamics on the cortical surface (Pinotsis et al., 2012). Combining generative models with
Bayesian optimisation techniques enables one to characterise the
functional architectures that generate empirical data. In this paper, we
show that DCM can disambiguate between alternative spatiotemporal
models of cortical activity — using Bayesian model comparison — and
furnish quantitative explanations of observed responses, in terms of
the biophysical properties of lateral cortical connections. This work focuses on two classes of biophysical models describing mesoscale brain

activity: neural mass and ﬁeld models. Neural ﬁeld models describe
how hidden neuronal states (such as the average depolarisation of a
neural population or layer) evolve over both space and time. In
contrast, neural mass models only characterise dynamics over time,
under the assumption that all the neurons of a particular population
are located at (approximately) the same point.
In previous work (Pinotsis et al., 2012), we considered the relationship between neural mass and ﬁeld models and showed that
ﬁeld models can be reduced to neural masses by applying shrinkage
priors to spike propagation times — such that lateral interactions
were effectively instantaneous. We introduced a DCM that provides
an explicit model of spatially extended cortical activity that allows
one to make inferences about key parameters controlling the topographic distribution of cortical activity using LFP data, like the extent
of lateral cortical connections and the conduction velocity of spike
propagation. We were able to show that including spatial parameters
enables one to explain effects that other models — such as neural
mass models — attribute to variations in temporal parameters, like
synaptic rate constants. Dynamic causal models based on neural ﬁelds
enable one to characterise the propagation of activity on the cortex
and provide a formal understanding of the mechanisms generating
spatiotemporal responses. In our previous work above, we considered

model optimisation under the assumption that one could measure local
signals (local ﬁeld potentials) that are sensitive to all spatial frequencies.
In this paper, we consider neural ﬁeld models of non-invasive (EEG or
MEG) data. This development allows one to make inferences about
the nature of lateral interactions in cortical sources, without spatially
resolved measurements.
Spectral responses of neural ﬁelds
The characterisation of electrophysiological signals depends upon
models of how they are generated in source space and how the
resulting (hidden) neuronal states are detected by sensors. At the
source level we consider a model based upon a canonical microcircuit
that allows one to separate the sources of forward and backward connections in cortical hierarchies. In terms of the mapping from source
to sensor space — we use a conventional lead ﬁeld formulation that
is expanded in terms of spatial basis functions. As in previous work,
we focus on the modelling of power spectra. There is a long history
of modelling steady-state (or ongoing) activity spectra, associated
with neural ﬁelds, usually in models of the whole cortex, e.g., (Jirsa,
2009). Robinson (2006) has developed a neurophysiologically grounded
model of corticothalamic activity, which reproduces many properties of
empirical EEG signals; such as the spectral peaks seen in various sleep
states and seizure activity. Technically, the spectra summarising the
response of cortical sources can be deﬁned in terms of transfer functions,
mapping endogenous neuronal ﬂuctuations to observed responses
(Freeman, 1972; Nunez, 1995; Robinson et al., 2001; Robinson et
al., 2003). In Pinotsis and Friston (2011), we derived the transfer
function — and an expression for the spectral responses — for a source
described by a classical neural ﬁeld equation, while in Pinotsis et al.
(2012) we extended our approach to a cortical source that comprises
multiple layers. This allowed us to model the spectral activity of cortical
ﬁelds as measured on the cortical surface. Here, we pursue a similar approach and generate the corresponding spectral responses, as measured
by non-invasive sensors. These predictions are generated in an efﬁcient
manner that exploits the nature of the mapping from sources to sensors
in EEG and MEG.
The resulting scheme can be regarded as inverting or ﬁtting population models of the Amari type, using real data and Bayesian model
inversion. Previous work in a similar vein includes the use of Kalman
ﬁlters to develop estimation schemes for both neural mass (Riera et
al., 2007; Valdes et al., 1999) and neural ﬁeld models of a single
population (Galka et al., 2008; Schiff and Sauer, 2008). In a related approach, Daunizeau et al. (2009)) replaced the standard dipole source —
used in neural mass models — with the principal Fourier mode of a
neural ﬁeld, for the particular case of exponentially decaying synaptic
density over the cortical surface. Finally (Markounikau et al. (2010)
used a combination of linear and nonlinear optimisation methods to
invert a two-layered neural ﬁeld model of voltage-sensitive dye data,
describing inhibitory and excitatory populations (without conduction
delays). The neural ﬁeld model considered here has four layers and is
based on canonical cortical microcircuitry that accounts for several aspects of local cortical computations in theoretical neurobiology. This
model provides an extension of the well known Jansen and Rit neural
mass model and incorporates conduction delays associated with the
propagation of neuronal spikes.

pattern formation, by analysing the steady-state behaviour of underlying ﬁeld equations: for example, Wilson and Cowan developed a treatment of Turing instabilities in the context of neural ﬁelds (Wilson and
Cowan, 1972). In a similar vein, Grossberg initiated a line of work on
shunting interactions — via nonlinearly coupled inputs — and considered
limits as the solutions approached steady state (Grossberg, 1973). At
about the same time, Amari proved that systems of neural ﬁelds typically
approach steady-state, in which some parts remain active, thus providing a metaphor for short-term memory.
From an anatomical viewpoint, the functional specialisation of visual (and auditory) cortex is reﬂected in its patchy or modular organisation — in which local cortical structures share common response
properties. This organisation may be mediated by a patchy distribution of horizontal intrinsic connections that can extend up to 8 mm,
linking neurons with similar receptive ﬁelds: see, e.g., Angelucci and
Bressloff (2006), Burkhalter and Bernardo, (1989), and Wallace and
Bajwa (1991). The existence of patchy connections in different cortical
areas (and species) has been established with tracer studies in man, macaque and cat: Burkhalter and Bernardo (1989), Stettler et al. (2002) and
(Wallace and Bajwa (1991), respectively. It has been shown that such
connections can have profound implications for neural ﬁeld dynamics:
see Baker and Cowan (2009). The precise form of such connections
may be explained by self-organisation under functional and structural
constraints; for example, minimising the length of myelinated axons to
offset the cost of transmitting action potentials (Cherniak, 1994; Wen
and Chklovskii, 2008). Generic constraints of this sort have been used
to motivate general principles of connectivity; namely, that evolution
attempts to optimise a trade-off between metabolic cost and topological complexity (Bassett et al., 2010). In short, visual and auditory
cortices can be characterised by a patchy organisation that is conserved over the cortex and which allows for both convergence and
divergence of cortical connections. Synaptic densities can then be
approximated by isotropic distributions with an exponential decay
over the cortical surface. In this work, we use a combination of
patchy and isotropic distributions, using connectivity kernels with
non-central peaks to model sparse intrinsic connections in cortical
circuits that mediate both local and non-local interactions. In
other words, we consider models in which neurons receive signals
both from their immediate neighbours and remote populations
that share the same functional selectivity (Pinotsis and Friston,
2011). We focus on the particular problem of identifying the parameters of lateral connections within a bounded cortical patch or manifold,
as measured at a distance, with an array of non-invasive (MEG or EEG)
sensors.
This paper comprises three sections. The ﬁrst reviews a canonical
neural mass model based on anatomical data and theoretical constraints from the theory of predictive coding. The second section describes a neural ﬁeld model based upon this canonical microcircuitry.
Our focus here is on equipping the resulting neuronal model with an
electromagnetic forward model to predict responses in non-invasive
sensors. In the third section, we use Bayesian model comparison to adjudicate between various formulations of the ensuing neural ﬁeld
model (DCM) and establish its construct validity by optimising parameters pertaining to GABAergic concentrations, that have been shown to
correlate with the peak gamma frequency of steady-state activity
(Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2009).

Lateral interactions and neural ﬁelds
A canonical model of cortical activity
Modelling lateral interactions with neural ﬁeld models has a long
history. Pioneering work was introduced in papers by Amari, Wilson
and Cowan, Grossberg and colleagues (Amari and Arbib, 1977;
Amari and Takeuchi, 1978; Grossberg and Levine, 1975; Wilson and
Cowan, 1973). These developments can be traced back to the work of
physicists in the 19th century — such as Helmholtz and Mach — on
visual perception. The ﬁrst neural ﬁeld models considered spontaneous

This section introduces the neuronal ﬁeld model used in subsequent sections on dynamic causal modelling. The particular neuronal
model of source activity used here is based upon a reﬁnement of conventional (convolution–based) neuronal models that explicitly model
the neuronal sources of forward and backward connections in cortical
hierarchies — these are the superﬁcial and deep pyramidal cell

D.A. Pinotsis et al. / NeuroImage 66 (2013) 563–576

populations respectively. We develop the corresponding neural ﬁeld
model from established neural mass models.
The canonical microcircuit
Recent work suggests that superﬁcial layers of visual cortex oscillate
at gamma frequencies, while deep layers primarily oscillate at lower
frequencies (Buffalo et al., 2011). Since forward connections originate
predominately from superﬁcial layers and backward connections
primarily originate in deep layers, these spectral asymmetries suggest
that forward connections use faster (gamma) temporal frequencies,
while backward connections may employ lower (alpha or beta)
frequencies — a suggestion that has experimental support (Roopun et
al., 2010). These asymmetries mandate something quite remarkable:
namely, a synthesis and segregation of forward and backward efferents from afferent input. This segregation can only arise from local
non-linear neuronal computations that are structured and precisely
interconnected. Non-linear neuronal transformations are necessary
to account for the implicit coupling between different frequencies
and arise from both synaptic mechanisms (e.g. non-linear dendritic
integration) and population dynamics (e.g. sigmoid activation functions). The canonical microcircuit is a detailed proposal for such a
laminar-speciﬁc intracortical architecture that describes how information ﬂows through the cortical column. This model is based on
ﬁndings in the primary visual cortex (Douglas and Martin, 1991)
but recent work (Lefort et al., 2009; Weiler et al., 2008) indicates that
similar microcircuits exist in other regions, such as somatosensory
and motor cortex.
Douglas and Martin recorded intracellular potentials from cells in
area 17 of the cat while they stimulated cortical afferents and noticed
a strong compartmentalisation of the superﬁcial and deep cell
properties — reﬂected in slow superﬁcial responses and fast input
layer responses. The authors created a conductance-based model
that reproduced the evolution of excitation and inhibition through
the cortical circuit with great precision. This model contained three
groups of cells: superﬁcial and deep pyramidal cells, and a common
pool of inhibitory cells. All three pools of neurons receive thalamic
drive — although the thalamic drive to deep layer cells was weaker
than the others. All neuronal populations expressed signiﬁcant
self-connectivity, and interconnected with the other populations.
This model reproduced the features observed in their electrophysiological recordings — including the latency difference between superﬁcial and deep layer neurons — and has served to establish several
basic properties that are now believed to be replicated in other cortical areas: ﬁrst, although superﬁcial and deep compartments are
strongly interconnected, their response properties are also strongly
segregated. Second, cortex is not under tonic inhibition, rather, both
excitation and inhibition are generated by afferent thalamic input
and both shape ongoing cortical responses. Third, the canonical
microcircuit can amplify thalamic inputs to generate self-sustaining
activity, while also maintaining a delicate balance between excitation
and inhibition — so as to prevent runaway excitation.
Previous computational modelling studies indicate that this circuitry allows the cortex to optimally organise and integrate bottom-up, lateral, and top-down information (Raizada and Grossberg, 2003).
Douglas and Martin suggest that the rich anatomical connectivity of superﬁcial layer (2/3) pyramidal cells allows them to collect information
from all relevant top-down, lateral, and bottom-up inputs, and —
through processing in the dendritic tree — select the most likely interpretation of its subcortical inputs. For a relevant discussion and more
details on the canonical microcircuit and its potential role in predictive
coding we refer the reader to Bastos et al. (under review).
Haeusler and Maass used Hodgkin and Huxley neurons to build a
realistic microcircuit model and showed that a cortical column —
whose connectivity conforms to the canonical microcircuit — can
perform various computations efﬁciently, in relation to a column

565

with random connectivity (Haeusler and Maass, 2007). By collapsing
two pairs of cell types in the Haeusler and Maass model — while preserving the topology of the connectivity — one obtains the canonical
microcircuit depicted in Fig. 1: this circuit comprises four populations: excitatory spiny stellate input cells (1), inhibitory interneurons (2), deep excitatory output pyramidal cells (3) and superﬁcial
excitatory pyramidal cells (4). In what follows, we describe a mathematical model of how the neuronal states of this these populations
evolve over time. This model provides the basis of our dynamic causal
model:We ﬁrst deﬁne the vector-valued function
T

V ¼ ðv1 ; v2 ; v3 ; v4 Þ

ð1Þ

where va(t) denotes the expected depolarisation of the a-th population (a = 1,…,4) at time t. The dynamics of depolarisation are then
described by the following second-order differential equation:
2

ð2Þ

where U ðt Þ∈R4 is a vector of external inputs (exogenous neuronal
ﬂuctuations) and A and B are 4 × 4 matrices of synaptic parameters
controlling the maximum postsynaptic responses for excitatory (me)
and inhibitory (mi) populations and the rate-constants of postsynaptic ﬁltering (κ1, …, κ4; c.f., decay):
A ¼ diagðme ; mi ; me ; me Þ
B ¼ diagðκ 1 ; κ 2 ; κ 3 ; κ 4 Þ

F : R →R is a nonlinear mapping from postsynaptic depolarisation
to presynaptic ﬁring rates and G : R4 →R4 maps the inputs to the
motion of hidden neuronal states; namely
T

G ¼ ðκ 1 me ; 0; 0; 0Þ

ð4Þ

In summary, Eq. (2) expresses the rate of change of expected
depolarisation in each population as a sum of three terms; the ﬁrst
is a simple decay, the second is due to presynaptic input from other
parts of the cortex and the ﬁnal part is due to external inputs U(t).
Writing out Eq. (2) in component form, we have

where the sigmoid ﬁring rate function is
σ ðva Þ ¼

ð6Þ

Here, r and η are parameters that determine the shape of this sigmoid activation function. In particular, r is synaptic gain and η is the
postsynaptic potential at which the half of the maximum ﬁring rate
is elicited. In Eq. (5), dab ⋅ σ(vb) is (endogenous) presynaptic input
to the a-th population from the b-th and corresponds to the mapping
F ∘ V. This is a sigmoid function σ(vb) of postsynaptic depolarisation in
the b-th population, multiplied by the intrinsic connection strength
dab between the two populations (Jansen and Rit, 1995). See Fig. 1
for a schematic of this model.
A canonical microcircuit ﬁeld model and its transfer function
In the case of neural ﬁeld models, we consider spatially extended
sources occupying bounded manifolds (patches) in different layers
that lie beneath the cortical surface. In this setting, each population

Fig. 1. The Canonical Microcircuit (CMC) neural mass model. This ﬁgure shows the evolution equations that specify a CMC mass model of a single source. This model contains four
populations occupying different cortical layers: the pyramidal cell population of the JR model is here split into two subpopulations allowing a separation of the sources of forward
and backward connections in cortical hierarchies. As with the JR model, second-order differential equations mediate a linear convolution of presynaptic activity to produce
postsynaptic depolarisation. This depolarisation gives rise to ﬁring rates within each sub-population that provide inputs to other populations.

now becomes a layer in the cortical sheet. Here, the input U(x,t) is an
explicit function of both space and time. Furthermore, the 4 × 1 vector
V ðt Þ∈R4 pertaining to the hidden neuronal states of each layer is replaced by V ðx; t Þ∈R4 ; a vector ﬁeld depending on both time and
space. The dynamics of cortical sources now conform to
integrodifferential equations, such as the Wilson-Cowan or Amari
equations, where coupling is parameterised by matrix-valued coupling kernels — namely, smooth (analytic) connectivity matrices
that also depend on time and space. These spatial generalisations
can be summarised in the following equation, which is the analogue
of Eq. (2) for neural ﬁeld models:

where the elements of the connectivity matrix D(x,t) are dab(x,t) =
kab(x)δ(t − |x|υ). This spatiotemporal matrix corresponds to the
ﬁrst-order approximation to the composition of the spatial kernels
K(x) deﬁned below and the temporarily delayed ﬁring rates.

where υ is the inverse speed with which spikes propagate along
connections and interactions among populations — within and
across macrocolumns — are described by the connectivity kernel
K = K (i) + K (e). One can see that in the inﬁnite speed limit υ =
0 the spatial convolution in the above Equation disappears (to within a scaling constant) and we recover the neural mass eq. (5). In this
limit, the corresponding electrophysiological predictions effectively
coincide with those generated by a neural mass model. We will
use prior constraints on the propagation speed below to compare
ﬁeld and mass variants of the canonical microcircuit (for a fuller

discussion, see Pinotsis et al., 2012). The intrinsic part K (i) is an
exponentially decaying kernel commonly used in the literature to
account for excitatory and inhibitory interactions (see e.g. Pinotsis
et al., 2012), while the extrinsic part of the kernel K (e) was introduced in Grindrod and Pinotsis, (2011) and Pinotsis and Friston
(2011) to model patchy lateral connections. This kernel is
characterised by non-central peaks allowing for differences in (and
estimation of) the range and dispersion of lateral connections,
summarised in terms of the parameters ha and caa respectively,

Here, the parameters aab and cab encode the strength (analogous
to the number of synaptic connections) and extent of intrinsic
connections between cortical layers. The intrinsic connections can
be regarded as interlaminar connections within a macrocolumn,
while the extrinsic (between macrocolumn) connections correspond
to horizontal connections and connect layers of the same type at a
distance ha. Later, we will use the extent parameter cab as a measure

D.A. Pinotsis et al. / NeuroImage 66 (2013) 563–576

of the size of cortical macrocolumns: see Fig. 2 for an illustration
of the spatial parameters and Fig. 3 for a distinction between
interlaminar and horizontal intra-laminar connections.
On comparing Eqs. (2) and (7) we notice that presynaptic input to
the a-th population from the b-th is now expressed in terms of a
spatiotemporal convolution as opposed to the simple nonlinear
(sigmoid) mapping of neural mass models. For connectivity kernels
modelling homogeneous (local) interactions, this convolution gives
rise to wave equations describing propagation of the presynaptic
input on the cortical manifold. In essence, Eq. (7) with connectivity
deﬁned by Eq. (8) deﬁnes a class of neural ﬁeld models that can
accommodate the intrinsic connectivity rules prescribed by the
canonical microcircuit.
As in our earlier work (Pinotsis and Friston, 2011; Pinotsis et al.,
2012), we assume that the neural ﬁeld deﬁned by Eq. (7) is perturbed
around a spatially homogeneous steady-state V0 (attained in the
absence of external or exogenous perturbations)

attributed to a variable columnar size (the c parameter of Fig. 2).

mapping from source space to sensor space that completes the

In what follows, we describe the generative or forward mapping

with real data and requires a mapping of neuronal states (the
depolarisation ﬁelds above) to sensors. This mapping is called the
lead ﬁeld. The lead ﬁeld allows one to infer hidden parameters
characterising the deployment of sources on the cortical surface,
even when there is no explicit spatial information in the data, see
also Robinson et al. (2004). The lead ﬁeld samples particular spatiotemporal frequencies, depending on the sensitivity proﬁle of the sensors used. For example, if the lead ﬁeld has a narrow spatial support
(e.g., when using LFP electrodes), its spatial Fourier transform will
be broad and it will be sensitive to a wide range of spatial frequencies.
Conversely, when the lead ﬁeld sees a large part of the cortical surface
(e.g., non-invasive EEG sensors), the spatial Fourier transform will be
narrow and only ﬂuctuations in low spatial frequencies will contribute to the observed cross-spectra.
In the illustrative examples below we used an adaptive spatial
ﬁlter or beamformer (Van Veen et al., 1997) to obtain estimates of
ongoing neuronal activity in primary visual cortex (Schwarzkopf et
al., 2012). This provides an estimate of electrical cortical activity
based on a weighted combination of sensors — sometimes referred
to as a virtual electrode. In other words, we will consider a single
(virtual) sensor — so that the lead ﬁeld maps from hidden neuronal
states to a single data channel. We ﬁrst describe the lead ﬁeld and
its parameterisation in terms of a Fourier basis set and coefﬁcients
that scale the contribution of neuronal states in each layer. We then
describe how the predicted spectral response at the sensor depends
upon the (Fourier transforms) of the lead ﬁeld and the transfer
function T(k,ω) above that maps external inputs to neuronal states.
Given the particular form of the lead ﬁeld, we can simplify the expressions for the resulting transfer function from external inputs to spectral responses. This transfer function provides the basis of our
probabilistic model. In detail:The lead ﬁeld is parameterised by φ as
a continuous gain function L(x,φ) over the cortical patch that is applied to a mixture of neuronal (depolarisation) states at each point

Eq. (24) reﬂects the fact that the predicted spectral responses of
the system are coupled to its spatial as well as its temporal properties;
these properties are encoded in the transfer functions Sa(k,ω) and
R(k,ω) through the underlying connectivity functions Dab(k,ω). In
turn, these are speciﬁed by the synaptic parameters associated with
the canonical microcircuit θ ⊂ {mi,me,κi,κe,r,η} and the spatial parameters θ ⊂ {aab,cab,ha,υab} that encode intrinsic and extrinsic connections
among different layers and neighbouring columns or points on the
cortical manifold.

The spectra of the neuronal ﬂuctuations or input gu(ω,θ) are assumed to be spatially white; namely, they do not depend on spatial
frequency. However both input and noise spectra are modelled as a
mixture of white and coloured ﬂuctuations over time. In completing
the model, we have introduced extra free parameters θ ⊂ {αn,αu,βn,βu}
controlling the spectra of the inputs and channel noise. Eq. (30) provides the basis for our generative model and entails free parameters
controlling the spectra of the inputs and channel noise as well as
the amplitude of observation error. Gaussian assumptions about the
observation error mean that we have a probabilistic mapping from
all unknown (free) parameters to observed (spectral) data features.
Inversion of this model means estimating, probabilistically, the free
parameters given data.
Model inversion and ﬁtting
Having prescribed the generative model of our DCM, we can now
turn to its optimisation via Bayesian techniques. Almost universally,
the ﬁtting or inversion of Dynamic Causal Models optimises variational
free-energy. Variational free-energy serves as a bound approximation
to the log-evidence ln p(gy|M) for a model M. This optimisation is carried out with respect to a variational density q(θ) on the unknown
model parameters. By construction, the free-energy bound ensures
that when the variational density maximises free-energy, it approximates the true posterior density over parameters, q(θ) ≈ p(θ|gy, M).
At the same time, the free-energy approximates the log-evidence
(log-marginal likelihood of the data). The (approximate) conditional
density and (approximate) log-evidence are used for inference on
parameters and models respectively. In other words, one ﬁrst
compares different models (e.g., with and without particular connections) using their log-evidence and then turns to inferences on parameters, under the model selected. One usually assumes the conditional
density has a Gaussian form qðθÞ ¼ N ðμ; C Þ. This is known as the
Laplace assumption. The conditional density is summarised by the
most likely value of the parameters, μ and their conditional covariance
C that encodes uncertainty about the estimates and their conditional
dependencies. A full description of the resulting Variational Laplace
scheme can be found in Friston et al. (2007).
The underlying generative model generally admits a unique solution
during model inversion; this follows from the use of biophysically plausible priors over the biophysical parameters. Table 1 describes the priors
over synaptic parameters (that are also used in the classical Jansen and
Rit model) as well as parameters pertaining to the spatial structure of
cortical sources. These priors are based on the modelling literature.
Others come from the experimental literature; e.g. the prior for the
conduction velocity is assumed to be 1.5 m/s (Kandel et al., 2000;
Steriade et al., 1997). In general, priors are chosen to restrict parameter
estimates in a physiologically meaningful range. However, it should be
noted that the precise values of the priors are not important: the inversion scheme has the latitude to accommodate deviations from these
values to optimise model evidence.

Results — an empirical illustration and validation
In previous work (Schwarzkopf et al., 2012), we recorded visually
induced gamma oscillations in a group of healthy human subjects
using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and used functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the surface area of central
primary visual cortex (V1) with standard retinotopic mapping
techniques (Dale et al., 1999; Sereno et al., 1995). We showed that
the retinotopically deﬁned surface areas of central V1 and V2 are
correlated with the peak frequency of visually induced oscillations
in the MEG gamma band. This led to the proposal that individual differences in macroscopic gamma frequency may be attributed to
inter-individual variability in the microscopic architecture of visual
cortex (Schwarzkopf et al., 2012). In this section, we use the neural
ﬁeld model of the previous section to address this proposal.
Empirical data and validation
Here, we used MEG data and beamforming to summarise the spectral
expression of endogenous activity in the visual cortex of 16 subjects, see
Fig. 4 and Schwarzkopf et al. (2012). Each participant was stimulated in
both left and right visual ﬁelds — so we characterised separate sources
in right and left hemispheres, resulting in 32 data sets. Subjects were
seated in a MEG system and viewed the stimulus on a projection screen
in front of them. During the entire recording run, they were required to
maintain ﬁxation on a small red dot in the centre of the screen. The

may reﬂect inter-individual variability in the architecture of visual cortex.

stimulus was a static, high-contrast, square-wave, vertical grating, which
measured 4°×4° of visual angle and had a spatial frequency of 3 cycles
per degree. The grating was presented on a mean luminance uniform
gray background in the lower visual ﬁeld, such that the corner closest to
the centre of gaze was horizontally and vertically displaced from the ﬁxation spot by 0.5°. There were 180 trials; on half the grating was shown in
the lower right quadrant; on the other half, it was shown in the lower left.
We recorded MEG data using a whole-head CTF axial gradiometer system
with 275 channels, sampled at 600 Hz. Three electrical coils were placed
at ﬁducial locations and used to monitor subject head movement.
Data were analysed using SPM8 (http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm).
Recordings were divided into epochs from 1.5 s before stimulus onset
until 1.5 s after stimulus onset (i.e., the earliest time for stimulus offset
that preceded the participant's behavioural response). Employing a
beamforming approach, we estimated induced MEG responses to a
visual stimulus in a virtual electrode placed in the medial occipital
cortex, in a location consistent with primary visual cortex. We used an
LCMV beamformer algorithm (Van Veen et al., 1997) implemented in
SPM8 to quantify source power in the time window between 0.5 and
1.5 s after stimulus onset relative to baseline power over one second preceding stimulus onset. Source orientation at each voxel was determined
using the method of Sekihara et al. (2004). We located peak gamma
activity in the medial occipital cortex, and at this peak location we used
the beamformer weights to extract the time series of the virtual electrode.
Power spectra for frequencies between 30 and 80 Hz during the stimulation and the baseline were calculated using a multitaper spectral
estimate (Thomson, 1982) using seven discrete prolate spheroidal
sequences as data tapers. To summarise the peak gamma frequency —
and the amplitude and bandwidth of the gamma response — we ﬁtted a
Gaussian function to the percentage power change in each frequency
bin. A full description of the paradigm, recording and processing can be
found in Schwarzkopf et al. (2012).
We modelled these spectral data — using DCM — to address the following questions: (i) Are neural masses or ﬁelds more appropriate for
explaining these data? (ii) Can differences in the width of cortical columns explain the intersubject differences in gamma frequency?
(iii) How does cortical excitability relate to the peak gamma frequency? And (iv) what are the important determinants of spectral gamma
activity? The ﬁrst question illustrates the use of Bayesian model comparison to compare DCMs based on neural ﬁelds and neural masses.
We will see below that — for the MEG data and generative models considered here — the evidence for neural ﬁeld models is relatively weak,
which itself is interesting in relation to previous results. However, our
primary aim was to show how DCM can answer anatomical questions
about brain topography and architecture; by appealing to neural ﬁeld
models that embody plausible assumptions about source deployment
and microcircuitry. We illustrate this point using subject-speciﬁc
estimates of intrinsic connections from DCM and establish their predictive validity in terms of their ability to predict inter-subject variations in the size of V1 and gamma activity. We consider that the
visual cortex is tiled with (overlapping) macrocolumns and assume
that the major inﬂuences on each macrocolumn come from its nearest
neighbours. We also assume rotational symmetry so that the spatial
organisation of macro columns can be modelled by the ﬁeld model
described in the previous section (see Figs. 2 and 3). These connections
are characterised by parameters describing local synaptic arbours
(like the strength aab and extent 1/cab of intralaminar connections)
and the range of horizontal connections (ha). Our objective was to provide a mechanistic link between observed cross-spectral densities and
local microstructure: we used the spatial decay rate of horizontal
interlaminar connections cab as an estimate of column width.
Neural masses or ﬁelds?
Clearly, the choice of an appropriate model depends upon the question of interest; in particular, neural ﬁelds are appropriate for

addressing questions about the deployment of sources on the cortical
surface and induced spatial dynamics. However, neural ﬁeld models
might still be more appropriate from a Bayesian perspective, even if
the spatial parameters of a neuronal model are not the focus of
study: In the context of our Bayesian scheme, each model is scored
using a free energy bound on model-evidence, where better models
have a higher free energy (assuming free energy is a good approximation to model evidence). The model with the highest evidence implies
the model has an optimal balance between accuracy and complexity —
in the sense that the model provides an accurate explanation for the
data in the simplest way. In our earlier work, we showed that Bayesian
model selection can distinguish between neural mass and ﬁeld variants
of the same microcircuitry; where — for LFP data from the rat auditory
cortex — the neural ﬁeld variant had more evidence. This could be
explained by the fact that neural ﬁeld models provide an augmented
repertoire of predictions for dynamics resulting from the propagation
of activity on the cortical surface. In short, our earlier model comparisons showed that the neural ﬁeld model yields a better ﬁt to the LFP
data — while accounting for the complexity cost due to its extra free
parameters.
Here, we performed a similar analysis, by computing the relative
log-evidence (using the free energy approximation) for the canonical
microcircuit model, comparing ﬁeld and mass variants at the group
level. Synaptic (κ1, me, aab) spatial (υ, cab) and sigmoid (r, η) parameters were optimised, while the remaining parameters in Table 1 including the horizontal distance ha were ﬁxed to physiologically
plausible values. As with our previous model comparison, the neural
mass model was formulated as a special (and limiting) case of the
neural ﬁeld model by shrinking the propagation delays (conduction
times) times to zero. See Fig. 5 for an example of a model ﬁt to a
single subject's response, using the neural ﬁeld and mass variants.
Contrary to our earlier result, we found inconsistent evidence in
favour of the neural mass model (the log-evidence for the neural
mass model was on average 2.37 greater than that of the ﬁeld
model): see Fig. 6 (top panel). In relation to our previous model comparisons, this result highlights the fact that the best model depends
upon the data analysed. It also underlines the importance of combining a neuronal model with a spatial forward model: although
both auditory and visual cortices are thought to conform to the
local homogeneity constraints implicit in neural ﬁeld models, the
loss of spatial frequency resolution — with non-invasive data —
might render neural ﬁeld models unnecessary, in relation to neural
mass models. In brief, model evidence depends crucially upon both
the chosen models and the particular dataset used for their comparison. Our failure to establish a greater evidence for neural ﬁeld
models, in the present model comparison, is intuitively sensible
because non-invasive MEG data have much lower spatial resolution
than the LFP data we used in the previous model comparison. This
observation speaks to the potential importance of using spatially
resolved data to take full advantage of neural ﬁeld models: data
with high signal to noise ratio and wide brain coverage — such as
those afforded by ECoG sensors or multi-array grids — can, in principle, disclose a full spectrum of spatiotemporal dynamics at different
scales. This may be important for an informed (efﬁcient) estimate of
spatial parameters in neural ﬁeld models. We will illustrate this
point further in future work.
To assess conditional dependencies among parameter estimates,
we computed the mean of posterior correlation matrices across all
subjects, see Fig. 6 (right) and considered a correlation between a
particular pair of parameters (one spatial and one neuronal —
bottom left): the key thing to notice here are the relatively weak
correlations between posterior estimates of columnar width and
a23 (the strength of connections from deep pyramidal cells to inhibitory interneurons). We will focus on this connection later when
assessing the importance of spatial and synaptic parameters in
predicting peak gamma frequency.

during visual stimulation (Schwarzkopf et al., 2012). We observe that the ﬁts of both the ﬁeld and mass models are equally good with no manifest differences.

Finally, we characterised the variations in spectral proﬁle produced by changes in these two parameters about their posterior estimates. Our aim here was not to provide a systematic characterisation
of the neural ﬁeld model; for this we refer the reader to earlier work
(Nunez, 1995; Robinson et al., 2001, 2003, 2004; Valdes et al., 1999).
We just wanted to provide a demonstration of the complicated but
smooth contribution to spectral responses made by various parameters. It is this contribution that enables us to obtain informed
estimates of underlying microcircuitry. Note that increasing both
the spatial and neuronal parameters increases peak gamma frequency. In other words, increasing the spatial extent of local horizontal
connections and increasing the excitatory drive to inhibitory interneurons increases peak gamma frequency. However, these parameters show (weak) negative conditional correlations. This means it is
an open question as to which parameter is best able to account for
changes in peak gamma frequency over subjects.

Can individual differences in peak gamma frequency be attributed to
wider columns?
Our conventional analyses (Schwarzkopf et al., 2012), showed a
strong positive correlation between gamma peak frequency and V1
surface area. This implies that individual differences in V1 area
might reﬂect differences in cortical architecture. A larger cortex
could either comprise a similar number of wider columns or simply
contain a greater number of columns of constant width, which
would be consistent with the explanation offered by the model of
Prothero, (1997). Anatomical evidence suggests that the microarchitecture of V1 in humans resembles a scaled version of macaque
V1, implying that column width increases with V1 size across
species (Adams et al., 2007). However, across individuals of the
same species both the width and number of columns can be highly
variable (Horton and Hocking, 1996). Crucially, we can resolve this

issue directly given the parameterisation of the intrinsic connectivity within the neural ﬁeld model. In our model, the width of a
macrocolumn, corresponds to the dispersion of horizontal synaptic
connections 1/cab.
We found a correlation between columnar width and peak gamma
frequency that reached trend signiﬁcance (see top panel of Fig. 8).
Given our previous empirical ﬁnding (that peak gamma frequency
and V1 surface area are positively correlated) we considered a
one-tailed test and found Pearson r = 0.271, p = 0.06, (d.f. 30). This
correlation implies that variability in the observed spectral responses
in the gamma range can be attributed to individual differences in columnar width. This ﬁnding is more than simply noting that increasing
the size of a column increases peak gamma frequency under the neural ﬁeld model (see Fig. 7). This is because all the other free parameters of the model were optimised in a subject-speciﬁc fashion. In
short, the hypothesis that intersubject variations in columnar width
are associated with peak gamma frequencies was conﬁrmed thereby
providing a microscopic explanation for the correlation between
peak gamma frequency and macroscopic (retinotopic) measurements
of visual cortex anatomy — an explanation based purely on noninvasive MEG data.
We also found a signiﬁcant positive correlation between columnar
width and V1 size as measured with retinotopic mapping (see bottom
panel of Fig. 8, where Pearson r = 0.36, p = 0.02, 30 d.f., — one-tailed
test). This suggests that subjects with a larger V1 have wider as opposed
to more macrocolumns. The results in Fig. 8 are consistent with our
previous empirical ﬁnding of a signiﬁcant correlation between observed
gamma peak and size of the visual cortex (Schwarzkopf et al., 2012);
however, the mediation of this correlation can now be associated with
the organisation underlying cortical circuitry. This highlights the use of
a generative (mechanistic model) to characterise cortical microstructure
that would otherwise be hard or impossible to disclose.

Is gamma activity related to GABAergic connections?
We next considered the relation of individual differences in
GABA concentration and peak gamma frequency (Gaetz et al., 2011;
Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2009,2010) in terms of parameters describing synaptic transmission: Muthukumaraswamy and colleagues
showed that individual differences in gamma oscillation frequency
are positively correlated with resting GABA concentration in visual cortex — as measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, they showed that fMRI responses are inversely correlated with
resting GABA and that gamma oscillation frequency is strongly inversely correlated with the magnitude of the BOLD response. These results
were taken to suggest that the excitation/inhibition balance in visual
cortex is reﬂected in peak gamma frequencies at rest. We address
this hypothesis by looking for correlations involving the connections
to inhibitory interneurons. We found that posterior estimates of the excitatory connections between deep pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons correlated negatively with gamma peak using both the
neural ﬁeld model (Pearson r = −0.37, p =0.02, 30 d.f, two-tailed
test) and the neural mass model (Pearson r = −0.36, p = 0.04, 30 d.f,
two-tailed test), see Fig. 9. This conﬁrms the hypothesis that intersubject variation in inhibitory drive in visual cortex is associated with
characteristic changes in the peak frequency of gamma oscillations —
and provides a mechanistic link from a synaptic level description to
spectral behaviour that can be measured noninvasively. In summary,
signiﬁcant correlations were found between a23 and peak gamma
frequency and columnar width and V1 size. Also, trend signiﬁcance
was observed for gamma peak to width correlations.
What are the important determinants of gamma peak frequency?
Previous studies suggested two possible causes for the inter-subject
variability in gamma peak frequency. Muthukumaraswamy et al.
(2009) suggested that peak gamma frequency is determined by the
level of inhibition in V1 as described by resting GABA concentration
measured with MR spectroscopy. In our previous study (Schwarzkopf
et al., 2012), we found a correlation between V1 size and peak gamma
frequency and suggested that the size of V1 and associated differences
in microanatomy could be true determinants of peak gamma frequency.
This suggests that both GABA concentration and V1 size can inﬂuence
gamma frequency; however they these factors may or may not be
causally linked.
Biophysical parameters estimated using DCM provide an opportunity to investigate alternative explanations of phenotypic differences, like
gamma peak frequency: our contribution analysis above (Fig. 7) shows
that the excitatory drive to inhibitory neurons (a23) and macrocolumn
width could mediate differences in peak gamma frequency. We therefore looked at the correlations over subjects between peak gamma
frequency (f), V1 surface area and the posterior estimates of these
parameters. These correlations are summarised in Table 2:
Interestingly, the partial correlation between a23 and gamma peak
remained signiﬁcant when controlling for V1 size and width 1/cab
(r = − 0.332, p = 0.037). This suggests that the correlation between
gamma peak and V1 inhibition cannot be accounted for completely
by the spatial parameters (at the microscopic or macroscopic level).
To elucidate the relationship between key model parameters and
the phenotypes of V1 size and peak gamma frequency, we used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) as implemented in SPSS Amos software (IBM). Each candidate model corresponded to a particular
hypothesis about the causal relationships between peak gamma
frequency and other variables. The Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) was used to compare models, while accounting for differences
in model complexity.
Fig. 10 shows models tested and the associated AIC values. To simplify the model space, we assumed that V1 size is determined genetically (or epigenetically) and is not inﬂuenced by peak gamma

By exploiting a combination of neural ﬁeld modelling and Bayesian
inference, we have shown that dynamic causal modelling can answer
the following sorts of questions: which is the best biophysical model
for explaining electrophysiological data? What are the important
determinants of gamma peak frequency — in terms of synaptic parameters and horizontal interactions? Can MEG beamformed data help us
access local cortical microstructure? And how can we distinguish
between competing hypotheses about structure-function relationships? We have focused on two classes of biophysical models of brain

models in which peak gamma frequency depends upon the drive to
inhibitory cells. This is consistent with the signiﬁcant partial correlations we found between a23 and f above. The best model (Model 8)
captured the correlation structure between the variables very well,
as can be seen from Table 3 showing the predicted and observed correlations (in parentheses).
In this model, the correlation between V1 size and peak gamma frequency is mediated by a direct path (reﬂecting the inﬂuences of V1 size
on peak gamma frequency that can be attributed to variables not considered in these models) and an indirect path through columnar width
and excitatory connections. In other words, peak gamma frequency is
mediated proximately by excitatory drive to inhibitory (GABAergic)
interneurons and the strength of this drive is determined, in part, by
the size of macrocolumns. In turn, the size of the macro columns is

activity; so-called neural ﬁeld and mass models and have considered
their application to modelling empirical MEG data. Bayesian model
comparison — using a variational free energy approximation to model
evidence — suggests neural ﬁeld models provide a better explanation
of empirical data if, and only if, there is sufﬁcient spatial frequency information in the data. In other words, we found greater evidence for
neural ﬁeld models in previous analyses of LFP data but failed to ﬁnd
more evidence for neural ﬁeld models, relative to neural mass models,
in the current study of MEG (virtual electrode) data. The key distinction between these different modalities is that the LFP data is sensitive
to a wide range of spatial frequencies and the temporal ﬂuctuations
that these frequencies contain. In contrast, the lead ﬁelds inherent
in non-invasive electromagnetic recordings are necessarily broader
and suppress temporal dynamics that are expressed in high spatial
frequencies.
However, the use of neural ﬁeld models may be necessary when
testing hypotheses that are framed in terms of the spatial parameters
of neural ﬁelds — like lateral or horizontal connections: we illustrated
this using a neural ﬁeld DCM to explain inter-subject variations in
spectral activity in terms of synaptic and connectivity parameters.
We showed that the posterior estimates of cortical anatomy — in particular columnar width — are associated with the spectral peak in the
gamma range. Indeed, the estimates of column width made from a
single time-series estimate in the foveal portion of V1 correlates
directly with size of V1 as estimate from retinotopic mapping. This
constitutes a compelling illustration of how non-invasive data can
provide quantitative estimates of the spatial properties of neural
sources and explain systematic variations in the dynamics those
sources generate. We also found correlations, over subjects, between
the peak gamma frequency and cortical inhibition as parameterised
by the excitatory drive to inhibitory cell populations. This correlation
was motivated by previous studies looking at the three way relationship between resting GABA concentrations in visual cortex, characteristic gamma activity and excitability — as measured with evoked
responses using fMRI (Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2009).
Implications for visual perception
While visually induced gamma oscillations have received increasing
attention and appear to play a role in visual perception (Herrmann et
al., 2010), it remains unclear what determines the spectral properties
of an individual's gamma response, and how it relates to underlying
visual cortex microcircuitry. Characterising individual differences in
cortical micro-architecture may have important implications for
research on visual processing. A few studies have claimed to directly
visualise columnar architecture in human visual cortex (Goodyear
and Menon, 2001; Goodyear et al., 2002; Yacoub et al., 2008). These
studies rely on ultra-high ﬁeld fMRI and are technically challenging
and therefore not available for widespread use. Furthermore, while
the spatial resolution of these experiments may be sufﬁcient to identify
cortical columns it may be unable to reliably resolve individual differences in the column width. This limits such investigations to invasive
optical imaging of intrinsic signals or voltage-sensitive dyes in animal
models; yet typically animal studies do not focus on individual differences across large groups. A reliable biomarker of columnar architecture — readily measurable with non-invasive techniques — may
therefore be very useful for investigating individual differences in cortical micro-architecture in human subjects.
Previous research shows that macroscopic measures of V1 size
predict visual perceptual ability such as Vernier discrimination
(Duncan and Boynton, 2003). We recently showed that the size of
V1 is negatively correlated with the strength of visual illusions,
where the conscious perception of a visual stimulus is modiﬁed by
the spatial context in which it is presented (Schwarzkopf et al.,
2011a, 2011b). We interpreted these results as evidence that local
contextual interactions in V1 are weaker in individuals with a large

575

V1 area — because they have to be transmitted laterally over greater
distances. Furthermore, the size of population receptive ﬁelds (pRF) —
which reﬂect a combination of the size and positional scatter of
the receptive ﬁelds of single neurons — as well as the extent of contextual interactions beyond the classical receptive ﬁeld — are
smaller in subjects with a large V1 (Harvey and Dumoulin, 2011).
This implies a greater tendency to favour local processing in a
large V1. Consistent with this, orientation discrimination is also superior in individuals with a large V1 (Schwarzkopf et al., 2011a).
Our results imply that better orientation discrimination could be
explained by both wider cortical columns and stronger lateral inhibition. This hypothesis is also supported by the empirical work of
(Edden et al., 2009) who found that GABA concentration correlates
with both gamma peak frequency and orientation discrimination
ability; we will focus on this issue in future work.
In summary, individuals with larger retinotopic visual cortices
might have weaker contextual interactions and more extended spatial processing. Both these ﬁndings are consistent with a greater dispersion of horizontal connections, inferred on the basis of our DCM
results. Interestingly, gamma oscillation frequency is also correlated
with orientation discrimination ability, which suggests that orientation discrimination, V1 size, pRF size, GABA concentration and
gamma oscillations are all inter-related. We hope to have shown
how Dynamic Causal Modelling with neural ﬁelds may provide a
quantitative and mechanistic approach to such correlations among
cortical structure and function.

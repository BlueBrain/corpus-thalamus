Yu XJ, Xu XX, Chen X, He S, He J. Slow recovery from excitation of
thalamic reticular nucleus neurons. J Neurophysiol 101: 980 –987, 2009.
First published December 10, 2008; doi:10.1152/jn.91130.2008. Responses to repeated auditory stimuli were examined in 103 neurons in
the auditory region of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and in 20
medial geniculate (MGB) neurons of anesthetized rats. A further six
TRN neurons were recorded from awake rats. The TRN neurons
showed strong responses to the first trial and weak responses to the
subsequent trials of repeated auditory stimuli and electrical stimulation of the MGB and auditory cortex when the interstimulus interval
(ISI) was short (Ͻ3 s). They responded to the second trial when the
interstimulus interval was lengthened to Ն3 s. These responses
contrasted to those of MGB neurons, which responded to repeated
auditory stimuli of different ISIs. The TRN neurons showed a significant increase in the onset auditory response from 9.5 to 76.5 Hz when
the ISI was increased from 200 ms to 10 s (P Ͻ 0.001, ANOVA). The
duration of the auditory-evoked oscillation was longer when the ISI
was lengthened. The slow recovery of the TRN neurons after oscillation of burst firings to fast repetitive stimulus was a reflection of a
different role than that of the thalamocortical relay neurons. Supposedly the TRN is involved in the process of attention such as attention
shift; the slow recovery of TRN neurons probably limits the frequent
change of the attention in a fast rhythm.
INTRODUCTION

The dorsal thalamus relays sensory and motor information to
the cerebral cortex and receives strong modulation from its projection cortex. Both thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections send collaterals to the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) in
the ventral thalamus. The GABAergic neurons of the TRN project
only to the dorsal thalamus (Houser et al. 1980; Jones 1975;
Steriade et al. 1997; Yen et al. 1985) and exhibit burst firing and
rhythmic oscillations reflecting the interaction of thalamus and
cortex (Bal and McCormick 1993; Descheˆnes et al. 1985; McCormick and Prince 1986; Steriade and Descheˆnes 1984). Its
location, unique connections, and firing patterns have led to the
TRN being proposed both as an important player in the internal
attention searchlight circuit (Crick 1984) and as a bridge linking
the specific and nonspecific pathways, leading to a large-scale
coordination of neuronal processes (Llina´s and Pare´ 1997).
In the auditory region of the TRN, neurons show various
response patterns to the acoustic stimulus: burst response,
phasic ON response and OFF response (Shosaku and Sumitomo
1983; Simm et al. 1990). Acoustical stimulation can evoke 5to 13-Hz oscillations in TRN neurons, while TRN activation
induces focal Gamma waves of ϳ35–55 Hz in the cortex
(Cotillon and Edeline 2000; Cotillon-Williams and Edeline

2003; Shosaku and Sumitomo 1983; Xu et al. 2008). The TRN
neurons are tuned to a broad range of frequency and are not
tonotopically organized (Simm et al. 1990).
Using in vivo extracellular recordings from both anesthetized and conscious animals, we examined the temporal features of TRN neurons with acoustic stimulus and with electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex and the medial geniculate
body. We also compared the response properties of TRN
neurons with those of thalamic relay neurons.
METHODS

Animal preparation
Wistar rats of either sex, weighing 280 –360 g with clean external ears
served as subjects. Anesthesia was initially induced with urethane (1.5g/
kg, 20% solution ip, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) and maintained by
supplemental doses of the same anesthetic (0.5 g⅐kgϪ1 ⅐hϪ1) during the
surgical preparation and recording. Atropine sulfate (0.05 mg/kg sc) was
given 15 min before anesthesia to inhibit tracheal secretion. A local
anesthetic (xylocaine 2%) was liberally infiltrated in the wound to reduce
discomfort. Animals were surgically prepared as described previously
(Guo et al. 2007; He 2001; Xiong et al. 2004). Briefly, the subject was
mounted in a stereotaxic device following the induction of anesthesia. A
midline incision was made in the scalp, and craniotomies were performed
to enable us to vertically access the medial geniculate body (MGB) and
the auditory sector of TRN and to perpendicularly access the auditory
cortex in the left hemisphere. The dura mater was removed at the
positions above the MGB, TRN, and auditory cortex. The procedures
were approved by the Animal Subjects Ethics Sub-Committee of the
Institute of Biophysics.

Acoustic stimulus
Acoustic stimuli were generated digitally by an Auditory Work
Station (Tucker-Davis Technologies, TDT, Alachua, FL), which was
controlled by a PC computer. Acoustic stimuli were delivered to the
subject via a coupled electrostatic speaker (EC1, TDT) mounted in a
probe. The sound pressure level (SPL) of the speaker was calibrated
with a condenser microphone (Center Technology). The subject was
placed in a double-walled sound-proof room. Repeated noise bursts
with varied inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) from 200 ms to 30 s were
used to examine the TRN and MGB neurons.

Recording
Tungsten microelectrodes with impedances of 2–7 M⍀ (Frederick
Haer, Bowdoin, ME) were advanced by a stepping-motor microdrive,
which was controlled outside the sound-proof room. The microelectrode and the acoustic stimulus signals were amplified and stored in

the PC computer using TDT software (OpenEX, TDT) and Axoscope
software (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). The time of spike
occurrence relative to stimulus delivery was calculated with Matlab
software (Mathworks, Natick, MA).
The TRN and MGB were accessed vertically from the top of the
brain in the stereotactically positioned subject. The penetrations were
made according to a rat brain atlas (Paxinos and Watson 2005). The
vertical coordinate of the electrode was determined at a point slightly
above the cortical surface at the first penetration. A single electrode
was used for each experiment so that the depth coordinates could be
kept consistent for different penetrations during the experiment for the
recording in the TRN. This technique enabled us to reconstruct a
physiological map of a whole frontal TRN plane containing many
penetrations by applying only a single lesion at the last penetration.
Multi-channel recording was performed to simultaneously record the
neuronal activities of a TRN neuron and a MGB neuron.

Electrical stimulation of the MGB and auditory cortex
Stimulating electrodes were implanted in the MGB and auditory
cortex in 34 subjects. Responses of the TRN neurons to repeated
electrical stimulations of varied ISI with a range of 200 ms to 10 s
were recorded. Single electric shock (1-ms biphasic pulse; 100 ␮A)
was used to activate the MGB or the auditory cortex.

Recording from conscious animals
Surgical preparation was similar to the anesthetized subjects. However, we implanted an electrode array (4 electrodes in 0.3-mm spacing, 1 M&OHgr;⍀, glass-coated, homemade) in the TRN that targeted
the auditory region. The location of the implanted electrode array was
examined with its auditory responses. The electrode array was connected to a socket which could be plugged into a homemade telemetric circuit (pictured as in Supplemental Fig. S7)1 to amplify and
transmit the neuronal signals to a computer. The socket was fixed on
the skull with dental cement and stainless screws. The subject was
then released from the stereotaxic device after a single administration
of analgesia and antibiotics.
The subjects were recovered for 6 days before the telemetric circuit
was plugged into the socket for recording. A two-channel telemetric
circuit (Supplemental Fig. S7) picked up the neuronal signals from the
two implanted electrodes and sent them via two FM transmitters (ϳ80
MHz) to the receiver (pictured as in Supplemental Fig. S7). The
neuronal signals were then forwarded and stored in the PC computer
with the assistance of TDT software (OpenEX) and Axoscope software as mentioned earlier. Acoustic stimuli were delivered to the
subject via electrostatic speaker (EC1, TDT) 2 m above the subject.

Anatomical confirmation
After the recording session, the subjects were deeply anesthetized
with sodium pentobarbital and perfused transcardially with 0.9%
saline followed by 0.4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(pH 7.3). The brains were removed and stored overnight in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer containing 30% sucrose. The thalami were cut
transversally into 50-␮m-thick sections with a freezing microtome.
All sections were stained with the Nissl method. The Nissl sections
were overlapped with the physiology map, through the electrode
penetration tracks and the lesion for guidance. Nine subjects were
used for the purpose of anatomical confirmation.
RESULTS

Results presented in the present report were mainly obtained
from anesthetized subjects (103 neurons from 42 anesthetized

subjects and 6 neurons from 3 awake subjects). The recordings
from the awake subjects were used to confirm our major
findings.
Auditory responses of TRN and MGB neurons
With repeated auditory stimuli in a fast repetition, TRN
neurons responded strongly to the first trial and weakly to the
subsequent trials before showing a good response some seconds later. The neurons showed an increased firing rate in the
auditory response when the ISI was lengthened gradually from
200 ms to 30 s. The first spike latency was shortened as the ISI
was increased. Figure 1 shows neuronal responses to repeated
stimuli of different ISIs from three TRN neurons in the auditory sector. The responses to the first and subsequent trials of
varied ISI are shown in Fig. 1. Aa–Ca. All neurons were
located in the TRN as shown in the microphotographs of Nissl
staining for their recording sites (bottom row, Fig. 1, A–C, a).
The neuronal responses to repeated auditory stimuli of varied
ISI were illustrated in the raster displays (Fig. 1, A–C, b).
The neuron in Fig. 1A responded to the first presentation of
the noise-burst stimulus with oscillatory firings whatever the
ISI was (Fig. 1Aa). The oscillatory firings lasted for Ͼ600 ms.
Although it was difficult to differentiate whether the longlasting oscillatory firings was purely evoked by the first presentation of the stimulus or by the first four presentations of the
stimulus, the neuron showed adaptation to the following trials
of the stimulus when the ISI was 200 ms for Ͼ5 s before
showing some spikes again (1st trace in Fig. 1Aa). The
multiunit firings of the second trace in Fig. 1Aa suggest that
the refractory period of the neuron decreased when the ISI was
lengthened to 1 s. The neuron responded to the second presentation of the stimulus when the ISI was lengthened further to
3 s although the oscillations observed in the second response
were not as long as the first. The neuron in Fig. 1B responded
only to the first few trials of the repeated stimuli when the ISI
was 200 ms (1st trace in a) but responded to every trial when
the ISI was lengthened to 1 and 3 s (middle and bottom traces
in a). The neuron in Fig. 1C showed response to the first trial
of the repeated stimuli of all ISIs (Fig. 1Ac). The neuron
showed very limited responses to the subsequent 10 trials when
the ISI was 200 ms (1st trace in Fig. 1Ac).
All examples in Fig. 1 show that TRN neurons responded to
the first trial of repeated stimuli when the ISI was short, e.g.,
200 ms. They showed increased responses to the subsequent
trials of the stimuli when the ISI was lengthened to 1 and 3 s.
Typical TRN neurons responded in the second trial with a
similar firing as in the first trial when we lengthened the ISI to
3 s as shown in Fig. 1, A–C (lowest traces in a). The raster
displays in Fig. 1 show responses to repeated stimuli of
different ISIs from 200 ms to 7 and 30 s. Neuronal responses
increased when the ISI was increased for all neurons. It was
also obvious that the latency of the onset responses to the
repeated stimuli was shortened when the ISI was lengthened
(most obvious in Fig. 1Bc).
Among the neurons in Fig. 1, those in A and B were recorded
from anesthetized subjects, whereas the neuron in Fig. 1C was
recorded from a conscious subject. The recordings from the
conscious subjects were of low signal-to-noise ratio. The adaptation of the neuron in Fig. 1C was best observed from the onset
responses to the repeated stimuli of different ISIs (Fig. 1Cc). (See

MGB neurons also responded strongly to the repeated auditory stimuli of longer ISI, but the differences of responses were
not comparable with TRN neurons. Figure 2 shows responses

trial of the repeated stimuli when the ISI was 200 ms (Fig.
3Aa). Both neurons responded to every trial of the repeated
noise bursts when the ISI was lengthened to 7 s (Fig. 3Ab).
The firing rate of the onset response for both neurons was
calculated and shown as a function of ISI in Fig. 3B. The ON
response of the MGB neuron remained constant when the
ISI increased from 200 ms to 30 s, whereas the TRN neuron
showed a fourfold increase as the ISI increased from 200 ms
to 30 s. The TRN neuron showed a steep increase when the
ISI increased from 200 ms to 3 s and saturated when the ISI
was Ͼ3 s.
Auditory responses as a function of the repeated trials
TRN neurons responded to the later trials differently than to
the first trial when the ISI was short (Fig. 1). We calculated the
responses to the stimulus in different trials over 95 TRN
neurons at different ISIs (Fig. 4). Neurons showed similar
onset auditory responses to the first trial of the repeated stimuli
at different ISIs. They showed a slight decrease in their
responses to subsequent trials of repeated stimuli when the ISI
was 1 s. It took several trials to reach the stable onset response
when the ISI was Ͻ1 s. The shorter the ISI, the greater the
response decrease to the subsequent stimuli.

2 ISIs: 200 ms and 7 s. Noise bursts of 100-ms duration were indicated as

even 200 ms (Fig. 2A, top trace). The neuron showed no
obvious difference in its onset response (defined as the 1st
spike cluster with latency of Ͻ100 ms) to the noise-burst
stimuli with different ISIs (Fig. 2, A, bottom trace, and B). The
first spike latency, however, was shortened as the ISI was
increased, which was similar to that for the TRN neurons.
Simultaneous recording of TRN and MGB neurons
Simultaneous recordings allowed us to confirm the aforementioned differences between TRN and MGB responses to
repeated acoustic stimuli of different ISIs. Figure 3 shows a
simultaneous recording of their responses to repeated stimuli of
different ISIs from a pair of TRN and MGB neurons. Similar
to the neuron in Fig. 1A, the TRN neuron showed oscillatory
firing response to the first trial of the repeated stimuli and weak
or no responses to the following trials when the ISI was 200
ms. However, the MGB neuron responded similarly to every

200-ms ISI in the MGB but increased responses to repeated
electrical stimuli of longer ISIs (Fig. 6A). TRN neurons
showed almost no response to repeated electrical stimuli of
ISI Յ 1 s in the auditory cortex but responded substantially to
those of ISI Ն 3 s (Fig. 6B). After the first 10 ms of the raster
displays were depicted, the gradually shortened first spike
latency could be observed in Fig. 6, middle. The response rate
as a function of ISI for both MGB stimulation and cortical
stimulation was similar to that for auditory stimuli as shown in
Fig. 6 (right). There was no obvious difference between the
cortical and MGB stimulations.
DISCUSSION

FIG. 4. TRN neurons response as a function of serial number of repeated
stimulus. The mean number of spikes for different trials of the repeated stimuli
was calculated during the 1st 100-ms peristimulus time over 95 TRN neurons.
Although 9 ISIs were examined, only 4 different ISIs, 200, 400, and 600 ms
and 1 s, were presented here for clarity.

Comparison of the auditory responses between the TRN
and MGB neurons
We calculated the mean response rate and latency to auditory stimuli at different ISIs for TRN neurons and MGB
neurons. The response rate was normalized to their response of
7 s. TRN neurons showed a statistically significant increase in
the onset auditory response from 9.5 to 69.9 Hz when the ISI
was increased from 200 ms to 7 s (P Ͻ 0.001, ANOVA, results
before normalization in Fig. 5). Normalized data showed significant differences between the responses of ISIs Յ 1 s and
that of ISI ϭ 7 s (all P Ͻ 0.001) for TRN neurons (Fig. 5).
Neurons in the MGB also showed an increase in the onset
auditory responses from 19.8 to 31.9 Hz when the ISI was
increased from 200 ms to 7 s (P ϭ 0.0563). No significant
differences were detected in other data points for the MGB
neurons. Significant differences were found between data
points when curves after normalization based on the common
stable point (ISI ϭ 7 s) were compared (Fig. 5A; ISIs: 0.2, 0.4,
0.6, 0.8, and 1 s, all P Ͻ 0.001).
The first spike latency decreased for both TRN and MGB
neurons as the ISI increased. The latency of the TRN neurons
decreased from 31.6 to 14.9 ms when the ISI increased from
400 ms to 7 s (P Ͻ 0.001), whereas that of the MGB neurons
decreased from 22.3 to 16.9 ms. The difference of the change
was not significant (P ϭ 0.058). The MGB neurons showed an
only significant decrease from 26.1 to 16.9 ms in the latency
comparing the ISIs of 200 ms and 7 s (P Ͻ 0.05), whereas the
TRN neurons showed still a significant decrease between the
data points of ISIs of 3 and 7 s (P Ͻ 0.05).

We examined the responses of TRN neurons and MGB
neurons to repeated auditory stimuli and/or electrical stimulation of the MGB and auditory cortex in both anesthetized and
awake animals. TRN neurons showed strong responses to the
first trial and weak responses to the subsequent trials of the
repeated auditory stimuli and electrical stimulation of the MGB
and auditory cortex when the ISI was short (Ͻ3 s). They
responded to the second trial similarly to the first trial when the
ISI was lengthened to Ն3 s. These responses contrast to those
of MGB neurons, which responded similarly to the repeated
auditory stimuli of different ISIs (Ն200 ms in the present
study). Although the majority of the results were obtained from
anesthetized subjects, the major finding that the TRN neurons

showed rapid adaptation was confirmed in recordings from
awake rats. The neuronal firing patterns between the anesthetized and conscious subjects was different, this topic needs
further investigation.
The major sources of input to the TRN are the collaterals
of thalamocortical and corticothalamic fibers, all of which pass
through the TRN (Jones 1975). The thalamocortical and corticothalamic collaterals display an anatomical topography in the
distribution of their terminals in the TRN (Yen et al. 1985).
Although there are multisensory neurons in the TRN, a sector of
the TRN is dedicated to each major thalamic nucleus (Crabtree
1992, 1996, 1998, 1999; Crabtree et al. 1998; Jones 1975;
Montero et al. 1977; Shosaku et al. 1984, 1989; Simm et al. 1990;
Steriade et al. 1984). Recently, Crabtree and Isaac (2002) showed
the TRNЈs involvement in the inter-modal interactions of the
somatosensory and motor nuclei in the thalamus.
All TRN neurons are GABAergic (Houser et al. 1980; Oertel
et al. 1983) and project back to the dorsal thalamus, applying
strong inhibition to the thalamocortical neurons (Crabtree
1996; Jones 1975; Rouiller et al. 1985; Steriade et al. 1984;
Zhang et al. 2008). TRN axons projecting to the principal
sensory nuclei exhibit restricted arbors, whereas those projecting to the second-order or multisensory nuclei have more
widespread arbors in those nuclei (Cox et al. 1996; Jones 1975;
Liu et al. 1995; Uhlrich et al. 1991).
Physiologically the TRN has been considered as the pacemaker for various thalamic oscillations (Contreras and Steriade
1996; Golshani and Jones 1999; Grenier et al. 1998; Steriade
and Descheˆnes 1984; Steriade et al. 1993a,b). Recordings from
the auditory regions of the TRN in the present study confirm
the oscillatory responses. The interspike intervals among the
successive spikes in the bursts of the spindle rhythm (Fig. 1A,
Supplemental Fig. 10A, and Supplemental Fig. S11), suggest
that the bursts were low-threshold calcium spike (LTS) bursts,
J Neurophysiol • VOL

which exhibited accelerando– decelerando spike patterns
(Contreras et al. 1996; He and Hu 2002; Jahnsen and Llina´s
1984a,b; Llina´s and Steriade 2006; Xu et al. 2008).
The auditory region of the TRN was activated by the
electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex in the present
study. The peak amplitude of corticothalamic excitatory
postsynaptic conductance is ϳ2.5 times higher in the TRN
neurons compared with that of thalamocortical neurons (Golshani et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2001), indicating that the corticofugal input to the TRN has a strong control over their
excitability (Steriade 2001). The TRN neurons extend dendrites within the thin reticular sheet, which enables them to
receive projections from a wide cortical region (Jones 1985).
The TRN is involved in both “specific” and “nonspecific”
thalamocortical pathways (Jones 1975; Llina´s and Pare´ 1997).
Both thalamocortical pathways/loops can reverberate, producing thalamocortical re-entry activity because the neurons involved are all capable of oscillatory activity (Llina´s and Pare´
1997; Steriade 2006). It was proposed that the specific and
nonspecific pathways could integrate with each other through
the TRN (Llina´s and Pare´ 1991, 1997). An intermediary role
for the TRN is plausible, as some neurons exhibit multimodal
responses and projections across nuclei (Crabtree and Isaac
2002; Shosaku and Sumitomo 1983; Simm et al. 1990). The
binding of the specific and nonspecific pathways through the
TRN was proposed to be involved in the process of attention
and cognition (Llina´s and Pare´ 1997).
One major finding in the present study was that the TRN
neurons depended on the ISI in responses to repeated stimuli.
This ISI dependence applied to both anesthetized and awake
subjects and to neurons in different firing modes. In contrast,
the MGB neurons responded to repeated stimuli. In other
words, the MGB neurons recovered much faster than the TRN
neurons, implying that the MGB neurons could relay the

auditory information to the cortex in both the frequency and
time domain. In the present study, no further localization of
subnuclei of the recorded neurons was made, and the possibility that other MGB neurons adapt to repeated stimuli could not
be ruled out. In the present study, the MGB neurons showed
minor adaptation when the ISI was 200 ms, with a decreased
response and lengthened latency (Fig. 5).
Compared with MGB neurons, TRN neurons showed strong
adaptation to ISIs in the hundreds of milliseconds. The shortlatency responses (Ͻ5 ms) of TRN neurons to electrical stimulation in the MGB and auditory cortex were likely monosynaptic and would reflect only their direct responses to the inputs
of MGB or auditory cortex (Fig. 6). Therefore the adaptation of
the short-latency responses indicated that the adaptation was
likely caused intrinsically by the TRN neurons themselves not
accumulatively through the ascending or recurrent thalamocortical circuit.
It is also of interest to note that the latency of the second
spike cluster of the stimulus-evoked oscillation was correlated
with sustained oscillations (Supplemental Fig. S10B). If the
oscillation consisted of LTS bursts, the degree to which the
oscillation was sustained should depend on the appearance of
bursting cycles, i.e., the longer the oscillation was sustained,
the more the oscillatory cycles. The latency of the first spike
cluster was shortened as the ISI was increased, whereas that of
the second was lengthened. The difference between the latencies of the second and first spike clusters would reflect the
refractory period of the LTS and also the depth of the hyperpolarization of the TRN neuron after the first LTS burst
(Contreras and Steriade 1996; Jahnsen and Llina´s 1984a). The
depth of the hyperpolarization of the TRN neurons should be
reflected in the sustained oscillation.
The slow recovery of the TRN neurons to fast repetitive
stimuli reflects a different role than that of the thalamocortical
relay neurons. If the TRN was to play a role in processes such
as attention shift (Crick 1984; Llina´s and Pare´ 1997), their slow
recovery might limit the rate of change of attention. Alternatively, TRN neurons may respond to novel stimuli as do some
IC neurons (Perez-Gonzalez et al. 2005). Novel stimulus detection would play a role in the search light hypothesis (Crick
1984). The process of attention and cognition for binding of the
specific and nonspecific pathways may also be related to
novelty detection (Llina´s and Pare´ 1997; Perez-Gonzalez et al.
2005; Ulanovsky et al. 2003). Our result adds to the recent
proposal that novelty detection happens only in the cortical
level (Ulanovsky et al. 2003).

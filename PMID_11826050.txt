de Jeu, Marcel and Cyriel Pennartz. Circadian modulation of
GABA function in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus: excitatory effects
during the night phase. J Neurophysiol 87: 834 – 844, 2002; 10.1152/
jn.00241.2001. Gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings were
made from slices of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of adult rats
to characterize the role of ␥-amino butyric acid (GABA) in the
circadian timing system. During the day, activation of GABAA receptors hyperpolarized the membrane of SCN neurons. During the
night, however, activation of GABAA receptors either hyperpolarized
or depolarized the membrane. These night-restricted depolarizations
in a large subset of SCN neurons were capable of triggering spikes
and thus appeared to be excitatory. The GABAA reversal potentials of
SCN neurons revealed a significant day-night difference with more
depolarized GABAA reversal potentials during the night than during
the day. The emergence of depolarizing GABAA-mediated responses
in a subset of SCN neurons at night can be ascribed to a depolarizing
shift in GABAA reversal potential. The GABAA receptor antagonist
bicuculline (12.5 ␮M) increased the spontaneous firing rate of all SCN
neurons during the day, indicating that spontaneous GABAA-mediated inputs inhibited the SCN neurons during this period. The effect
of bicuculline (12.5 ␮M) on the spontaneous firing rate of SCN
neurons during the night was heterogeneous due to the mixture of
depolarizing and hyperpolarizing GABAA-mediated inputs during this
period. We conclude that GABA uniformly acts as an inhibitory
transmitter during the day but excites a large subset of SCN neurons
at night. This day-night modulation of GABAergic neurotransmission
provides the SCN with a time-dependent gating mechanism that may
counteract propagation of excitatory signals throughout the biological
clock at day but promotes it at night.

The biological clock of the mammalian brain is located in
the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus (Lehman et al. 1987; Moore and Eichler 1972; Ralph et al. 1990;
Rusak and Zucker 1979; Stephan and Zucker 1972; Takahashi
and Zatz 1982). SCN neurons exhibit a cell-autonomous circadian rhythm in spontaneous firing (Bos and Mirmiran 1990;
Bouskila and Dudek 1993; Green and Gillette 1982; Groos and
Hendriks 1982; Inouye and Kawamura 1979; Welsh et al.
1995), which is transmitted to target areas and may impose a
circadian rhythm on a wide range of physiological functions
and behaviors. The neurons of the SCN form a complex
network consisting of several different cell types loaded with
many different neuroactive substances (Buijs et al. 1994; Jiang

et al. 1997; Pennartz et al. 1998a; van den Pol and Dudek 1993;
van den Pol and Tsujimoto 1985). The neurotransmitter
␥-amino butyric acid (GABA) is abundantly present in neurons
and terminals within the SCN (Buijs et al. 1994; Moore 1993;
van den Pol 1986), and electrophysiological studies have revealed that SCN neurons frequently receive GABAA receptormediated postsynaptic inputs (Jiang et al. 1997; Kim and
Dudek 1992). These GABAergic postsynaptic responses originate at least partly within the nucleus itself (Stecker et al.
1997), suggesting an important role for GABA in neural integration within the SCN.
The circadian rhythm in spontaneous firing rate (SFR) of
SCN neurons combined with the inhibitory nature of GABAergic neurotransmission in most areas of the matured mammalian CNS (Kaila 1994; Krnjevic 1976; Mody et al. 1994) led us
to the initial hypothesis that GABA would effectively subdue
the circadian rhythm in firing rate. That is, during the subjective day (when the SFR of SCN neurons is high), the neurons
of the SCN should be subjected to GABAergic inhibition to a
larger extent than during the night (when the SFR of the SCN
neurons is low). However, Wagner and colleagues (1997)
presented evidence that GABA acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter during the day but assumes an inhibitory role during the night, indicating that GABA may boost the amplitude
of the circadian rhythm in firing activity. These results are
contradicted by other studies (Bos and Mirmiran 1993;
Gribkoff et al. 1999; Liou and Albers 1990; Liou et al. 1990;
Liu and Reppert 2000) in which mainly inhibitory actions of
GABA were observed. To resolve this controversy and to
unravel the underlying mechanism of GABAergic involvement
in the circadian time-keeping system, we used the gramicidinperforated patch-clamp technique in acutely prepared slices
from the rat brain (de Jeu et al. 1998). With this electrophysiological technique, detailed information about GABAA receptor-mediated potentials and currents can be obtained without
disturbing the transmembrane ClϪ gradient, a disruption that
does occur in conventional whole cell patch-clamp recordings
(Kyrozis and Reichling 1995).
The main new finding presented in this study is the experimental evidence arguing in favor of an excitatory GABA effect
in a subset of SCN neurons recorded in the subjective night. A
small part of our results were already mentioned in a brief
communication (Gribkoff et al. 1999), but this was restricted to

bicuculline effects in the day phase. These results are recapitulated here to permit comparisons to the night phase.
METHODS

Slice preparation
Male Wistar rats, weighing 150 –300 g, were subjected to a 12:12
h light:dark cycle for Ն4 wk before use (lights on at CT 0). During the
light period, rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of
either pentobarbital sodium (Nembutal, 60 mg/kg) or chloralhydrate
(350 mg/kg) followed by transcardial perfusion with 35 ml ice-cold
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). The ACSF contained (in mM)
124.0 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1.0 NaH2PO4, 26.2 NaHCO3, 1.3 MgSO4, 2.5
CaCl2, and 11.0 D(ϩ)-glucose and was gassed with a mixture of 95%
O2-5% CO2 (pH 7.4; osmolality, 303–307 mOsm). The rats were
decapitated, and their brains were rapidly removed and immersed in
cold ACSF. The brains were trimmed to a block containing the
hypothalamus. Transverse slices of 200 ␮m thickness were cut with a
vibroslicer (Campden Instruments). Slices containing the SCN were
incubated in ACSF for Ն1 h. After this period, a slice was placed in
the recording chamber through which ACSF (30°C) flowed at 2–3
ml/min. The delay between preparation and recording was approximately equal for day and night measurements. During the 3 yr of
full-time research that this study took to be completed, we usually
alternated “day” and “night” experiments. The experiments were in
accordance with the Dutch national guidelines on animal experiments.
Besides anesthetizing the rats with Nembutal, we used chloralhydrate to investigate whether pentobarbital would affect GABAergic
synaptic transmission in SCN slice experiments. The decay time
constants of electrically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents
(IPSCs; measured at VH ϭ Ϫ103 mV) did not show significant
differences between Nembutal and chloralhydrate treatment (MannWhitney U test, n ϭ 24). Furthermore, no differences in reversal
potential were observed between the two treatments (Mann-Whitney
U test, n ϭ 19). These results indicate lack of a lingering effect of
Nembutal on GABAergic transmission in SCN slices.

Electrophysiological recordings
Gramicidin perforated patch-clamp recordings were performed as
described in de Jeu et al. (1998). The electrode solution contained (in
mM) 135.0 KGluconate, 10.0 KCl, 10.0 HEPES, and 0.5 EGTA (pH
adjusted to 7.2–7.4 with KOH; osmolality between 270 and 290
mOsm/kg). Gramicidin was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (5 mg/ml)
and added to the electrode solution (final concentration, 5 ␮g/ml). The
tip of the patch pipette was prefilled with a small amount of gramicidin-free electrode solution to prevent interference of gramicidin
with seal formation. Patch pipettes (4 – 8 M⍀) were back-filled with
the gramicidin containing electrode solution. The liquid junction
potential was approximately Ϫ13 mV (Neher 1992), and all the
membrane voltages in this study were corrected for this value.
Patch pipettes were positioned on SCN neurons under visual control, using an upright fixed-stage microscope (Axioskop, Zeiss)
equipped with a ϫ40 water-immersion lens (NA: 0.75) with Hoffman
modulation contrast. To keep the patch pipette clean while penetrating
the slice, a constant positive pressure was applied. Formation of a
gigaseal (Ͼ3 G⍀) was accomplished by mouth suction. After gigaseal
formation, membrane integrity and the progress of perforation were
monitored by regularly measuring the capacitive current (filtered at 10
kHz) evoked by a Ϫ20-mV voltage step. Membrane rupture could
easily be recognized by a sudden increase in capacitive current or, in
current-clamp mode, by a sudden increase in spike amplitude due to
the decrease in series resistance and in the associated filtering effect.
Current and voltage traces were acquired using an Axopatch-1D
amplifier, and were relayed by a Digidata 1200A Interface to a
personal computer equipped with pClamp 6.0.2 and Axotape 2.0.2 (all

from Axon Instruments). Action potential waveforms recorded in
perforated-patch mode with an Axopatch 1D and an Axoclamp 2B
amplifier did not reveal systematic differences in action potential
amplitude or shape, arguing against substantial spike deformation
induced by current absorption of the Axopatch 1D amplifier, as
suggested by Magistretti et al. (1998) (see also de Jeu et al. 1998;
Pennartz et al. 1998b).
Perforated patches with stable series resistance values were usually
obtained after 30 min. At this time the series resistance remained at a
stable average value of 75 Ϯ 5 (SE) M⍀ (n ϭ 55).
This relatively high series resistance posed a point of special
concern in this study. First we note that other groups have attempted
to apply gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings to the SCN but
concluded it was technically unfeasible (Colwell 1997). Second, we
made numerous attempts to lower the access resistance. However,
enhancing the gramicidin concentration, enlarging the pipette tip or
applying other variations invariably resulted in membrane rupture.
Thus it proved technically unfeasible to achieve an access resistance
similar to values found in most whole cell studies. It is of note that this
technical limitation has also been encountered in other gramicidinperforated patch-clamp studies (Kyrozis and Reichling 1995; Ulrich
and Huguenard 1997; Vale and Sanes 2000). The high series resistance also explains why absolute spike amplitudes are somewhat
lower than in whole cell studies (cf. Pennartz et al. 1997; Schaap et al.
1999); membrane rupture in perforated-patch mode invariably resulted in an increment of spikes reaching amplitudes of 80 –100 mV
with respect to baseline.
Given the high series resistance, we asked whether the resulting
voltage errors would prevent us from drawing strong conclusions. The
voltage error can be calculated by
Verr ϭ I h R s

where Ih is the holding current and Rs is the series resistance (Armstrong and Gilly 1992). Notably, the extremely high-input resistance
of SCN neurons (range 1–3 G⍀) (de Jeu et al. 1997; Pennartz et al.
1998b) results in very small holding currents. The mean voltage error
was thus estimated to lie in the range of 0.3– 0.7 mV, which is
generally considered acceptable. Furthermore, the series resistance
values for the day and night phase were similar (Mann-Whitney U
test; P Ͼ 0.05; day: n ϭ 27, night: n ϭ 28) and cannot explain the
day-night difference in reversal potential. Finally, the values for the
reversal potential and series resistance were not significantly correlated for day, night, or both taken together (for all correlations; P Ͼ
0.05).
For focal electrical stimulation a tungsten bipolar electrode (Frederick Haer, Bowdoinham, ME) was placed along the dorsal or ventrolateral borders of the SCN. Stimulation pulses were bipolar and
biphasic (duration: 0.2 ms; stimulus intensity: Ͻ0.5 mA).
Neurons in this study (primarily cluster I cells) (Pennartz et al.
1998b) clearly exhibited a circadian rhythm in firing rate (Fig. 4C),
and the firing rate values were similar to the values measured with the
extracellular cell-attached technique and the values found immediately after the membrane rupture using the whole cell patch-clamp
technique (Schaap et al. 1999). Furthermore, initial and final spontaneous firing rates were similar, revealing that the spontaneous firing
rate is well preserved under perforated-patch conditions even after
long periods of recording (de Jeu et al. 1998). Membrane rupture
resulted in an increment of spike amplitude toward a value of 80 –100
mV, similar to the spike amplitude measured with the whole cell
patch-clamp technique. All these observations indicate that our measurements were performed from healthy neurons.

from Tocris Cookson, Bristol, UK), and CGP 55845A (GABAB
receptor antagonist; gift from Ciba-Geigy, Basel, Switzerland) were
dissolved in distilled water for preparation of stock solutions and
diluted in ACSF to their final concentrations.
For experiments with GABA pulses, GABA (Tocris Cookson) was
dissolved in ACSF containing D-AP5 (50 ␮M), NBQX (5 ␮M), and
CGP 55845A (1 ␮M). The pH was adjusted to 7.2–7.4 with HCl.
GABA was locally applied by using a BPS-8 system equipped with a
micromanifold (100 ␮M ID), and the temperature of the applied
solution was kept at 30°C by a PRT-2000 system (all from ALA
Scientific Instruments, New York). It should be noted that the GABA
concentration at the cell is lower than in the application system
because of limited GABA diffusion through the superficial layers of
the slice. In pilot experiments, responses to lower GABA concentrations were smaller or absent.
RESULTS

Excitatory GABAA-mediated responses during the night
We activated GABAA receptors in the SCN by focal electrical stimulation of GABAergic fibers, providing a short,
endogenous GABA pulse, or alternatively by pulse application
of (exogenous) GABA. Focal electrical stimulation of the
SCN, in the presence of NMDA, AMPA/kainate, and GABABreceptor antagonists (D-AP5, 50 ␮M; NBQX, 5 ␮M; CGP
55845A, 1 ␮M, respectively), evoked postsynaptic responses,
which were completely and reversibly blocked by 12.5 ␮M
bicuculline during both day and night (Figs. 1A and 2A).
During the day period, electrically evoked GABAA receptormediated responses (Fig. 1A) were hyperpolarizing in 10 of 11
neurons, whereas only one neuron exhibited depolarizing
responses. Likewise, pulse application of exogenous GABA
(1 mM) during the day in the presence of D-AP5 (50 ␮M),
NBQX (5 ␮M), and CGP 55845A (1 ␮M) elicited hyperpo-

larizing responses (Fig. 1B) in 9 of 10 neurons and depolarizing responses in only one neuron.
In contrast, during the night period electrically evoked
GABAA receptor-mediated responses were hyperpolarizing in
7 of 15 and depolarizing in 8 of 15 neurons. In six of eight
neurons these depolarizing GABAA receptor-mediated responses were capable of triggering action potentials and thus
appeared to be excitatory (Fig. 2A). Similarly, pulse application of GABA during the night period resulted in hyperpolarizing response patterns in 7 of 12 and depolarizing response
patterns (Fig. 2B) in 5 of 12 neurons. In these night neurons,
the membrane potential was not significantly different between
neurons with a depolarizing and hyperpolarizing GABA responses (Mann-Whitney U test; all P Ͼ 0.05; nel.stim.ϭ 15,
nappl.ϭ 12), indicating that the switch in polarity was not
caused by a change in membrane potential. Focal electrical
stimulation and GABA application experiments (in this order)
were often performed on the same neuron (n ϭ 12; nday ϭ 5,
nnight ϭ 7) and in all these neurons, taken individually, the
polarity of the GABAA-mediated response was identical for
both technical approaches, indicating that the results were
independent of the technical procedure.
Both during day and night, the membrane potential changes
induced by exogenous GABA were strongly reduced by bicuculline (100 ␮M; this dose was selected because the relatively
high dose of GABA is likely to compete with bicuculline for
the receptor binding site). An interesting observation was that
in all neurons, whether displaying hyperpolarizing or depolarizing GABA response patterns, the firing activity was completely arrested during exogenously applied GABA except for
the initial response phase when GABA was depolarizing (see
Fig. 2B). This initial depolarizing response was accompanied
by one or several spikes, compatible with an excitatory action
of GABA. With respect to the prolonged phase of the depolarizations, the cessation of firing can be explained by the

stage of the depolarization action potentials
were still generated (see inset graph, 4) but
that later stages (associated with a strong decrease in input resistance) were marked by an
arrest of firing activity. All of these experiments were performed in the presence of DAP5 (50 ␮M), NBQX (5 ␮M), and CGP

occurrence of a massive shunting effect (Torre and Poggio
1978) (Fig. 2B, *) in conjunction with Naϩ channel inactivation (see DISCUSSION). It should be stressed that the generation
of action potentials was not prevented by these artifactual
processes during evoked or spontaneous synaptic GABAAmediated depolarizing responses, which occur on a much faster
time scale (Figs. 2A and 4B). In conclusion, results obtained
with focal electrical stimulation of GABAergic fibers and pulse
application of GABA indicate that the polarity and functional
effect of the GABAA receptor-mediated response vary in a
circadian manner in a large subpopulation of SCN neurons.

gave a similar result (Ϫ57 Ϯ 3 mV, n ϭ 15). In both experimental approaches, a significant day-night difference in
GABAA reversal potential was found (Mann-Whitney U test;
all P Ͻ 0.05). Normality tests (Shapiro-Wilks’ W test) suggested a normal distribution of GABAA reversal potential of
SCN neurons during the day (P Ͼ 0.05), whereas the GABAA
reversal potential of SCN neurons during the night was not
normally distributed (P Ͻ 0.05). In conclusion, the distributions of GABAA reversal potentials revealed a significant daynight difference, which can be ascribed to a large subgroup of
SCN neurons with markedly depolarized GABAA reversal
potentials in the night phase.

Day-night difference in GABAA reversal potential
These results predict that a circadian shift in GABAA reversal potential (most likely by changes in intracellular ClϪ concentration) should occur in ϳ50% of the SCN neurons. To test
this, we investigated the reversal potential of GABAA receptormediated currents during the subjective day and night period.
Both electrical stimulation of GABAergic fibers (Fig. 3) and
pulse application of 1 mM GABA [both in the presence of
D-AP5 (50 ␮M), NBQX (5 ␮M), and CGP 55845A (1 ␮M)]
were used to determine the GABAA reversal potential. On
several SCN neurons, both experimental procedures were performed; the GABA pulse application experiments were always
preceded by the focal electrical stimulation experiments. For
electrically evoked GABAA receptor-mediated currents during
the subjective day, the GABAA reversal potential was Ϫ70 Ϯ
2 mV (n ϭ 17), in agreement with the inhibitory role of GABA
in this circadian time domain. With application of exogenous
GABA this value was Ϫ67 Ϯ 3 mV (n ϭ 17), which is not
significantly different. Activating the GABAergic receptors
with electrical stimulation during the subjective night period
revealed a more depolarized reversal potential: Ϫ59 Ϯ 4 mV
(n ϭ 18). Pulse application of GABA during the night period

Spontaneous GABAA-mediated inputs attenuate firing activity
during the day
We next investigated the contribution of spontaneous
GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission to the circadian
rhythm in SFR by measuring the effect of the GABAA receptor
antagonist bicuculline on the SFR during the subjective day
and night period. Bicuculline (12.5 ␮M) blocked virtually all
fast spontaneous synaptic inputs recorded in SCN neurons and
also affected their SFRs (Fig. 4, A and B). During the subjective day period, bicuculline increased the SFR of all SCN
neurons (mean increment: 2.9 Ϯ 0.8 Hz, mean Ϯ SE; Wilcoxon’s matched-pairs signed-rank test; P Ͻ 0.01, n ϭ 10; Fig.
4C), suggesting that GABAA receptor-mediated postsynaptic
potentials inhibited SCN neurons during this period (cf.
Gribkoff et al. 1999). The effect of bicuculline on the firing
activity of SCN neurons could not be ascribed to a blocking
effect on IAHP. This was suggested by the observation that
bicuculline did not enhance or prolong the rebound depolarization. Such rebound depolarizations are evoked on release
of a negative rectangular current and are curtailed by IAHP
(Debarbieux et al. 1998; Pennartz et al. 1998b).

not a confounding factor. Scale bars: 100 pA, 50 ms (left; A); 100 pA, 83 ms (right, A).

During the subjective night, the effects of bicuculline were
variable and the mean change was not significant (mean increment: 1.4 Ϯ 1.5 Hz, n ϭ 10; Fig. 4C). The bicuculline-induced
changes in SFR were significantly larger during the day than
during the night (Mann-Whitney U test; P Ͻ 0.01, n ϭ 20).
Removal of bicuculline generally resulted in recovery of the
SFR to baseline levels. Taken together, these results suggest
that GABA moderately attenuates the circadian peak in spontaneous firing at daytime but has no strong effect on low-level
spontaneous firing at night.
Furthermore, the membrane was not significantly depolarized or hyperpolarized by bicuculline either during day or night
(Wilcoxon’s matched-pairs signed-rank test: ns; day: n ϭ 9,
night: n ϭ 10) and no correlation was observed between
bicuculline-induced changes in firing rate and small tonic
changes in membrane potential, which occasionally occurred
(linear regression: R ϭ 0.31, n ϭ 19). Likewise, the input
resistance and time constant were not affected by bicuculline
(n ϭ 9; day: n ϭ 4, night: n ϭ 5). These results strongly
suggest that the SFR was affected via discrete synaptic events
and not by tonic activation of GABAA receptors by ambient
GABA.
On closer inspection of the night data, three neurons showed
a bicuculline-induced increase in SFR, three neurons showed a
bicuculline-induced decrease in SFR (Fig. 4B), and four silent
cells did not start firing after the application of bicuculline.
This mixture of effects was clearly related to the polarity of the
GABAA-mediated response of these SCN neurons (hyperpolarized or depolarized with respect to rest; Figs. 2 and 4B).
Neurons displaying a bicuculline-induced decrease in SFR
exhibited spontaneous depolarizing postsynaptic potentials that
were capable of triggering spikes at rest (e.g., Fig. 4B, *). In
contrast, neurons displaying a bicuculline-induced increase in
SFR exhibited spontaneous hyperpolarizing postsynaptic potentials at rest. Both types of spontaneous postsynaptic potentials were blocked by bicuculline. Thus these results are in
agreement with our results on electrically evoked GABAAmediated responses and GABAA-mediated reversal potentials
during the night.
Alterations of GABAA-mediated response during long-lasting
activation
We decided to test SCN responses to long-lasting (Ͼ10 s)
GABA pulses in more detail because some of the existing
discrepancies in the literature may be related to the long
duration of GABA pulses used in many previous studies.
During long-lasting GABA pulses (1 mM), a partial recovery of the change in membrane potential was observed, suggesting a shift in reversal potential and/or desensitization of
GABAA receptor/channels (Adams and Brown 1975; Huguenard and Alger 1986). In voltage-clamp mode (VH ϭ Ϫ103
mV), the GABAA receptor-mediated inward current decreased
in all cells (n ϭ 13) already during the initial phase of such
long-lasting pulses (Ͼ10 s; e.g., Fig. 5C). The reduction in
GABAA receptor-mediated current can also be observed by
application of two consecutive GABA pulses while the neuron
is clamped at a constant holding potential not too close to the
GABAA reversal potential (Fig. 5, A and B, left panels). Attenuation of the second GABA response may be caused either
by a shift in GABAA reversal potential or by desensitization of
J Neurophysiol • VOL

GABAA receptor/channels. These processes can be separated
by applying a second protocol, in which the neuron is clamped
near the GABAA reversal potential during the first GABA
pulse but at the same holding potential of the previous protocol
during the second pulse. If the change in holding potential can
prevent the attenuation of the second current response, the
reduction of this second response can be attributed to a shift in
GABAA reversal potential (Fig. 5B); if not, it can be ascribed
to desensitization of GABAA receptor/channels (Fig. 5A). To
ensure the stability of our system, we always executed a third
protocol (which was identical to the first protocol) to show
“recovery” of our system. These recovery protocols indicated
that there was no run-down or desensitization during the entire
experiment. These double-pulse experiments suggested that
desensitization of GABAA receptor/channels occurred in 38%
of the neurons (5 of 13; e.g., Fig. 5A), whereas a shift in
GABAA reversal potential was found in 85% of the neurons
(10 of 13; e.g., Fig. 5B; note that some cells exhibited both
phenomena). Investigation of the GABAA conductance
(gGABA) during long-lasting applications showed that the onset
of the decay in gGABA was delayed compared with the decay in
GABAA receptor-mediated current response (IGABA), and that
gGABA decreased more slowly than IGABA (e.g., Fig. 5, C and
D, n ϭ 4). This result suggests that the initial decline in IGABA
was primarily caused by a shift in reversal potential (cf. Huguenard and Alger 1986).
DISCUSSION

Our data indicate that the GABAA reversal potential, and
thus probably the [ClϪ]i, is subjected to a circadian modulation
in a subpopulation of SCN neurons (Fig. 3C), resulting in a
polarity shift of the GABAA receptor-mediated postsynaptic
response from hyperpolarization during the subjective day to
depolarization during the subjective night. In the night phase,
the reversal potentials were not normally distributed, in agreement with the functional heterogeneity of GABA effects observed in current clamp mode. However, considering the widespread distribution of values, our data do not permit to decide
whether there exist one, two or more subpopulations in the
night phase. Post hoc staining of recorded cells was not possible because the perforated membrane under the pipette tip
could not be ruptured to allow cell labeling with a marker
substance (cf. Pennartz et al. 1998a,b). The net effect of spontaneous GABAA receptor-mediated postsynaptic potentials on
the circadian rhythm in firing rate was to moderately subdue
the peak at daytime as indicated by bicuculline effects. In
contrast, no significant effect of bicuculline was found during
the night (Fig. 4C). During the day, electrically evoked or
spontaneous GABAergic inputs attenuated the spontaneous
firing of almost all SCN neurons, whereas during the night
these inputs inhibited some SCN neurons but promoted firing
in others by way of depolarizing GABAA receptor-mediated
postsynaptic potentials (Figs. 1, 2, and 4). These GABA potentials at night were excitatory because spikes were triggered
on top of them, and bicuculline blocked these GABAergic
inputs as well as their associated spikes. Although the results
obtained with exogenous GABA are liable to criticisms set out
below, they were compatible with the results on electrically
evoked or spontaneous GABA potentials, in that they revealed

FIG. 5. Reversal potential shift and desensitization of GABAA receptor/channels
in SCN neurons. A and B: voltage-clamp
recordings showing GABAA receptor-mediated current responses using double-pulse
application of GABA (1 mM; pulse duration: 2 s, pulse interval: 15 s). Two different
voltage command protocols were used to
examine reversal potential shifts and/or desensitization of the GABAA receptor/channels. First, two GABAA receptor-mediated
current responses were measured at a constant holding potential, revealing the attenuation of the current response to the second
GABA pulse. Second, double GABAA receptor-mediated current responses were
evoked in a protocol where the holding potential during the first GABA pulse was
approximately kept at the GABAA reversal
potential and at the same holding potential
of the previous protocol during the second
pulse. A: attenuation of the 2nd GABA response could not be prevented by holding
the potential at the reversal potential during
the first GABA pulse (2); this result indicates that the GABAA-receptor/channels
were subject to a desensitization process.
B: in another cell, the attenuation of the 2nd
current response could be largely prevented
by holding the potential close to the reversal
potential during the 1st GABA pulse (2),
indicating that the attenuation of the second
GABA pulse response was caused by a shift in
reversal potential. C: recording of a GABAA

both de- and hyperpolarizing GABAA receptor-mediated responses during the night phase.
In a previous study, Gribkoff et al. (1999) concluded that
GABA assumes a pronounced inhibitory role in SCN during
the subjective day. Our results confirm this conclusion because
we found GABA to hyperpolarize SCN neurons and inhibit
firing during the same circadian phase. Furthermore, the multiunit and cell-attached recordings in Gribkoff et al. (1999)
showed a uniform cessation of firing induced by application of
exogenous GABA or the GABAA agonist muscimol, regardless of circadian phase. At first glance, the excitatory, nightrestricted effect of GABA reported here would appear to contradict this result. However, in contrast to perforated-patch
recordings, GABA-induced changes in membrane potential
and input resistance cannot be assessed in multi-unit and cellattached recordings. As further explained below, the possibility
that the inhibitory effects of GABA observed during the night
were caused by massive shunting cannot be ruled out with
these techniques. A further difference between the results of
J Neurophysiol • VOL

Gribkoff et al. (1999) and the present results is that GABAA
antagonists produced a significant excitation in multi-unit activity during both night and day, whereas in our perforatedpatch recordings, a significant elevation of firing rate was
found during the day but not night. A likely explanation of this
difference is that multi-unit recordings evaluate population
effects in which changes from many individual cells are
lumped together, whereas our recordings reveal a large biological variability in a comparatively small sample of neurons.
The overall population effect of GABAA receptor/channel
blockade, causing excitation in some individual cells and inhibition in others, may well be a net increase in firing (cf. Fig.
4C).
Our results argue against the hypothesis that the GABAergic
network of the SCN reinforces the circadian rhythm in SFR by
exciting SCN neurons during the day period and inhibiting
them during the night, as proposed by Wagner et al. (1997). An
important source of discrepancy could be the use of longlasting GABA applications (Ͼ10 s) (Wagner et al. 1997; but

also Bos and Mirmiran 1993; Gribkoff et al. 1999; Liou and
Albers 1990; Liou et al. 1990; Liu and Reppert 2000). Longlasting GABA applications appear to cause shifting of the
reversal potential and/or desensitization of GABAA receptor/
channels (Fig. 5), which may confound functional interpretation of GABA effects on SCN excitability. If prolonged GABA
pulses induce a shift in GABAA reversal potential, the driving
force for ClϪ will be reduced. Therefore the mean amplitude of
spontaneous GABAA receptor-mediated currents will decrease,
and, consequently, a reduction in GABAergic inhibition or
excitation is likely to occur. Desensitization of GABAA receptor/channels may also result in an attenuated postsynaptic
response to spontaneous GABAergic inputs. Consequently, the
results obtained with long-lasting applications of GABA may
paradoxically come to resemble results obtained with GABAA
receptor antagonists. The validity of this explanation remains
unknown because we did not use very long-lasting GABA
applications and did not intend to replicate the experiments of
Wagner et al. (1997), but in any case our results demonstrate
that results obtained with such application are confounded by
multiple factors.
In addition, application of exogenous GABA can cause
massive shunting (Torre and Poggio 1978) (Figs. 1B and 2B,
*), which further complicates the interpretation of results, in
particular because it partially occludes the excitatory effect of
GABA at night. In contrast to the excitatory effects of shortlasting, electrically stimulated release of GABA (Fig. 2A),
longer-lasting pulses of exogenous GABA resulted in an arrest
of firing activity after the initial stage of the depolarization
(Fig. 2B). In brief, such a shunting effect involves the massive
opening of GABAA receptor ClϪ channels, resulting in a
strongly increased conductance and accompanying depolarizing GABA current. This results in an effective “clamping” of
the membrane at the ClϪ reversal potential. Should any spike
occur in this situation, such massive depolarizing shunting will
curtail the ensuing spike repolarization, preventing Naϩ channels from becoming deinactivated. This effect is essentially the
same as the well-known depolarizing spike block observed
during long-lasting application of conventional excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate. Such massive shunting may explain why several extracellular recording studies found uniformly inhibitory GABA effects, regardless of circadian phase
(Bos and Mirmiran 1993; Gribkoff et al. 1999; Liou and Albers
1990; Liou et al. 1990; Liu and Reppert 2000) (cf. Fig. 2B).
Functional interpretations of bicuculline effects (Fig. 4), electrically evoked GABAA receptor-mediated potentials/currents
(Figs. 1A, 2A, and 3A), and the initial effect of exogenous
GABA pulses (Figs. 1B and 2B) are much less confounded by
these factors. A further discrepancy between our study and that
of Wagner et al. (1997) concerns the day-night difference in
GABAA reversal potential. Wagner et al. (1997) found a more
hyperpolarized reversal potential during the night than during
the day, whereas the present results indicate a more depolarized mean reversal potential at night. Estimation of the
GABAA reversal potential by studying the voltage dependence
of the SD in membrane potential in whole cell recordings
(Wagner et al. 1997) may be confounded by the fact that this
parameter can be influenced by intrinsic ionic currents (e.g., a
slow low-threshold component of Naϩ current) (Pennartz et al.
1997). Direct measurement of the reversal potential of GABAA
receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents (Fig. 3) evoked by
J Neurophysiol • VOL

electrical stimulation or exogenous GABA in gramicidin-perforated patch voltage-clamp mode is not susceptible to this
problem.
The circadian variation of the GABAA reversal potential in
ϳ50% of SCN neurons may be important not so much for
regulating the absolute magnitude of the circadian rhythm in
spontaneous firing rate but rather for the integration of environmental or internal timing cues in the circadian system. For
instance, photic inputs primarily enhance the firing rate of SCN
neurons by way of the glutamatergic fibers of the retinohypothalamic tract (Colwell and Menaker 1992; Groos and Mason
1980; Liou et al. 1986; Moore 1973). The inhibitory nature of
GABAergic transmission during the day period may counteract
the integration of timing cues by arresting the propagation of
these signals throughout the SCN. In contrast, during the night,
the excitatory nature of GABAergic transmission in a subset of
cells may promote signal dissemination throughout a restricted
domain of the SCN network and beyond. Thus the GABAergic
network may behave as an active filter that passes excitatory
inputs during the night but cuts them off during the day. This
idea is in line with the enhanced light-responsiveness of SCN
neurons at night compared with day (Meijer et al. 1998).
Propagation of light information throughout the SCN was also
indicated by spatiotemporal SCN profiles of clock gene expression (e.g., mper1) and activity markers (e.g., c-fos) (Albrecht et al. 1997).
To induce a phase shift, a perturbation of the molecular
clock is necessary (Leloup and Goldbeter 1998; Olde-Scheper
et al. 1999). GABAA-mediated depolarizations may serve to
disseminate phase-shifting signals throughout the SCN network and support the activation of the ensuing signal transduction cascade leading to clock resetting. It is tempting to
speculate that depolarizing GABAA receptor-mediated responses may increase intracellular Ca2ϩ levels by opening
voltage-activated Ca2ϩ channels (Obrietan and van den Pol
1995). Subsequently, activation of Ca2ϩ-dependent signal
transduction pathways (e.g., involving ERK/MAPK and
CREB) (Gillette 1997; Ginty et al. 1993; Obrietan et al. 1998)
may cause a resetting of the molecular clock. In a similar way,
the GABAergic network may synchronize the “clock cells” of
the SCN (Shigeyoshi et al. 1997; Yan et al. 1999). Recently,
Liu and Reppert (2000) showed that cultured SCN clock cells
could be synchronized by prolonged application of GABA.
Whether the depolarizing and excitatory action of GABA described here mediates this synchronizing effect remains to be
investigated because a maximal phase-shift was induced
around the subjective day-to-night transition, not throughout
the subjective night.
The circadian modulation of the GABAA reversal potential
has broader implications than for understanding SCN network
functioning. First, it indicates that in the adult brain, GABA
can switch between an excitatory and inhibitory function in a
time-dependent cyclic manner. Previously, only an irreversible
unidirectional switch from excitatory to inhibitory function
was shown to occur during embryonic development (Cherubini
et al. 1991; Rivera et al. 1999). Second, combining our results
with molecular studies may prompt research on the unresolved
issue as to how cyclic expression of clock genes leads to
modulation of mechanisms regulating membrane excitability,
including ionic transporters (Miles 1999).

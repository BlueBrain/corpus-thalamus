The excitatory effect of γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been recognized in very young animals
and in seizure generation, but not so much in animals after weaning age or in adults. The existence of this phenomenon in mature brain is still controversial. In the course of debate, creative
studies have identified and characterized the phenomenon in suprachiasmatic nucleus, cortex,
hippocampus and basolateral amygdala, albeit mostly in single neurons. In neural circuit activity, presumed GABAergic excitation was observed in basolateral amygdala during the study of
a neuropeptide, cholecystokinin. Though the functional meaning of this phenomenon in vivo
remains to be uncovered, it may be implicated in epilepsy or anxiety in the adult brain.

INTRODUCTION
GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in
the nervous system (Sivilotti and Nistri, 1991; Costa,
1998). The effect is mediated by GABAA and GABAB
receptors (Bowery et al., 2002; Olsen and Sieghart,
2008). The GABAA receptor is ionotropic receptor and
anion-selective channel (Olsen and Sieghart, 2008).
The major anion which passes through this channel is
the chloride ion (Cl−) (Olsen and Sieghart, 2008).
When the chloride reversal potential is below the
resting membrane potential, Cl− flows into the cell
and hyperpolarizes the membrane potential, which in
turn inhibits action potential generation. However, if
the chloride reversal potential is above the resting
membrane potential due to increased intracellular Cl−
concentration ([Cl−]i), channel opening results in an
outward Cl− current and membrane depolarization
(Ben-Ari, 2002).
This review focuses on the controversial, but intriguing phenomenon of depolarization or excitation
by GABA in the mature brain. As for the well-known
GABAergic depolarization in immature brains and
neonatal epilepsy, excellent reviews are available

GABAergic DEPOLARIZATION
In the discussion of depolarization and excitation, it
should always be kept in mind that the depolarization
does not necessarily lead to excitation, but instead it
may be inhibitory to the postsynaptic neurons. Depolarization or hyperpolarization refers to the membrane potential change. However excitation or inhibition refer to the increase or decrease of action potential generation, the end result of membrane potential
change. For example, depolarization of membrane potential below the action potential threshold can be inhibitory to action potential generation by subsequent
synaptic inputs because increased conductance prevents
membrane potential from reaching action potential
threshold even if this input alone could have evoked
action potentials (Staley and Mody, 1992; Marty and
Llano, 2005). In adults, hyperpolarizing GABA action
can move the membrane potential away from the action
potential threshold, but the conductance increase by
GABA can further inhibit the action potential generation.
In early postnatal life, GABA can be an excitatory
neurotransmitter (Cherubini et al., 1991). During the
first postnatal week, the GABAA receptor activation
depolarizes pyramidal neurons in hippocampus (BenAri et al., 1989; Cherubini et al., 1990). The GABAB re-

2035

2036

ceptor is also hyperpolarizing at birth, but its effect is
small relative to the depolarizing GABA effect mediated
by the GABAA receptor (Janigro and Schwartzkroin,
1988). In this period of early brain development, depolarizing GABA acts as a trophic factor and also is
involved in cell migration (Represa and Ben-Ari, 2005;
Bortone and Polleux, 2009; Koyama et al., 2012).
The direction of Cl− movement is determined by the
[Cl−]i (Ben-Ari, 2002) (Fig. 1). The [Cl−]i is maintained
partly by the Na+-K+-2Cl− co-transporter 1 (NKCC1)
and the K+-Cl− co-transporter 2 (KCC2) (Ben-Ari,
2002; Yamada et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2005; Blaesse et
al., 2009). NKCC1 is a sodium-coupled cation-chloride
co-transporter (CCC) that imports Cl− into the cell
using electrochemical gradient of sodium generated by
the Na+-K+-ATPase, while KCC2 exports Cl− using the
K+ gradient (Gamba, 2005). In the nervous system,
NKCC1 is expressed during early development while
KCC2 is expressed in mature neurons (Stein et al.,
2004; Wang and Kriegstein, 2011). The developmental
change from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing GABA is
accompanied by the decrease of NKCC1 and increase
of KCC2 which results in a reduction of [Cl−]i (Rivera
et al., 1999) (Fig. 1). However, the factors regulating the
NKCC1 and KCC2 switch are not clear yet. Intracellular signaling involving the transporters is beginning
to be unraveled. The intracellular regulation of the cotransporters involve with no K (lysine) kinases (WNK)
and STE20 (sterile 20)-like kinases (Delpire and
Gagnon, 2008; Kahle et al., 2008).

L. Chung

Though it has been widely accepted that GABA is depolarizing or excitatory in immature brain, a research
group (Zilberter group) produced a series of papers
asserting that the phenomenon is artifact due to insufficient energy supplies in brain slice preparations
(Rheims et al., 2009; Holmgren et al., 2010; Ivanov et
al., 2011; Mukhtarov et al., 2011). Not surprisingly, it
stimulated a series of interesting papers testing this
assertion from multiple groups (Kirmse et al., 2010;
Ruusuvuori et al., 2010; Tyzio et al., 2011). The conservative interpretation of the data from the Zilberter
group is that energy sources including ketone bodies,
lactate and pyruvate can contribute to the intracellular
chloride homeostasis in certain conditions (Zilberter et
al., 2010). Whether the data is enough to firmly deny
the other data for the GABAergic depolarization phenomenon during the neonatal period is up to a rather
subjective decision at this time (Khakhalin, 2011; BenAri et al., 2012; Bregestovski and Bernard, 2012). An
interesting piece of third party data came from adult
neural stem cells in which GABA is depolarizing to
the new born neurons in brain slice preparation (Ge et
al., 2006).

GABAergic DEPOLARIZATION OR EXCITATION IN INDIVIDUAL NEURONS FROM
MATURE BRAIN
It is generally accepted that GABA is inhibitory to
most adult neurons except in abnormal cases such as

Fig. 1. [Cl−]i is determined primarily by NKCC1 and KCC2 at different developmental stages. (A) In neurons of immature
brain, high expression of NKCC1 leads to high [Cl−]i enough for Cl− reversal potential above resting membrane potential. In
this condition, opening of Cl− channel by GABAAR activation results in Cl− efflux and membrane potential depolarization.
(B) In neurons of mature brain, high KCC2 expression leads to low [Cl−]i and Cl− reversal potential below resting membrane
potential. Contrary to the immature brain, Cl− channel opening by GABAAR activation causes influx of Cl− and hyperpolarization. GABAAR: GABAA receptor.

epilepsy (Costa, 1998). However, there are reports of
GABAergic depolarization and excitation in seemingly
normal states in multiple brain regions (Marty and
Llano, 2005).

Suprachiasmatic nucleus
Hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is
where circadian oscillation originates (Reppert and
Weaver, 2001; Hastings and Herzog, 2004). In SCN,
GABA increased firing rate recorded extracellularly
during the day, but inhibited firing at night in the
majority of cells from 3-to-8-week-old rats (Wagner et
al., 1997). From whole cell patch recording, the change
in [Cl−]i seemed to be the cause of the circadian GABA
effect. The [Cl−]i was high during the day and low
during the night (Wagner et al., 1997). The use of whole
cell patch technique limited the interpretation of the
data because the neuron's original physiological chloride
concentration was perturbed by the recording solution.
The chloride concentration of the neuron was not measured separately. To minimize the disturbance of chloride
concentration, gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp technique was subsequently used (De and Pennartz, 2002).
In this study, GABA was mostly inhibitory during the
day time, but at night time was excitatory in about
half of the neurons, which is opposite pattern to that
of Wagner et al. (1997). However, GABA remained excitatory to some neurons in SCN in both studies.
Contrary to the two reports above (Wagner et al., 1997;
De and Pennartz, 2002), GABA was mostly inhibitory
to the firing rate measured with a multiunit activity
recording technique in SCN (Gribkoff et al., 2003). The
advantage of extracellular multiunit recording is the
stable recording of a group of neurons for a long time
compared with single unit recording. The drawback is
that individual neurons’ characteristics can be lost
due to averaging the population together. If a small
subset of cells were excited by GABA, their response
could be masked by the inhibitory effect of GABA on
the majority.
This masking possibility was probably a real one as
shown in a later study employing multiple experimental techniques to a massive number of neurons (n =
786) (Choi et al., 2008). Exogenously applied GABA
was mostly inhibitory, but in a subset of cells, the firing
rate increased (15%) or appeared biphasic (13%) in
extracellular recording from rats (Choi et al., 2008).
Unlike Wagner et al. (1997), the excitation was more
common at night instead of the day time (Choi et al.,
2008). It was also region-dependent such that the
dorsal part of the SCN showed a higher percentage of
excitation than the ventral region did. The excitatory
effect could be reduced by application of bumetanide,

2037

NKCC1 inhibitor, or by recording in Nkcc1 knock-out
mice. This study provides strong evidence that GABA
can be excitatory to a small, but significant portion of
neurons in SCN. However, the possibility of weakened
chloride extrusion by KCC2 was not explored (Belenky
et al., 2008). An important future task is to show the
in vivo functional importance of this effect in those
minority of cells excited by GABA.

Cortex, hippocampus and basolateral amygdala
In cortical structures, the presence of GABAergic
depolarization has been in debate as summarized below.
GABA is depolarizing and excitatory depending on the
location of GABA application (dendrite or soma) and
the timing of GABA application relative to the action
potential or glutamatergic excitation in layer 5 pyramidal neurons from 3-to-4-week-old rats (Gulledge
and Stuart, 2003). In this work, GABA was exogenously
supplied, rather than using the interneurons as a
GABA source.
Dual recordings from synaptically connected pairs of
interneurons and pyramidal neurons enable a controlled physiological GABA release after an interneuron action potential. Axo-axonic inhibitory cells (also
called Chandelier cells in cortex) are a unique subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons that synapse specifically on the axon initial segment (AIS) of pyramidal
neurons in cortex (Lewis, 1998; Somogyi et al., 1998;
DeFelipe, 1999). Because action potentials are generated
near the AIS, this GABAergic synapse would strongly
inhibit action potential generation (Howard et al.,
2005). However, the recorded axo-axonic cells could
excite two out of 17 pyramidal neurons in 3-to-5-weekold rats although disynaptic depolarization after an
action potential from the axo-axonic cell was more
common (22 of 48) (Szabadics et al., 2006). The disynaptic depolarization implies that released GABA excites
glutamatergic neurons strongly enough for action
potential generation. This phenomenon was correlated
with low expression of KCC2 in the AIS, which suggests that the increased chloride concentration in AIS
is due to reduced extrusion of Cl−. A similar conclusion
is also possible if NKCC1 were highly expressed in the
AIS.
In basolateral amygdala, when pairs of two parvalbumin-positive interneurons were recorded, an action
potential in one neuron caused an outward current
followed by an inward current in the postsynaptic interneuron (Woodruff et al., 2006). The AMPA (2-amino3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid) receptor antagonist (NBQX) blocked only the inward
current, but the GABAA receptor antagonist (bicuculline)
blocked both currents. This indicates that GABA excited

2038

a glutamatergic neuron synapsing on the postsynaptic
interneuron. This idea is very similar to the disynaptic
depolarization seen in the cortex (Szabadics et al.,
2006).
Instead of KCC2, the role of NKCC1 in the chloride
reversal potential was tested in dentate gyrus (DG) of
hippocampus and layer 2/3 cortex (Khirug et al., 2008).
They used GABA uncaging to measure the reversal
potential from multiple locations on the AIS, soma
and dendrite. The relatively depolarized chloride reversal of AIS compared with soma was abolished in
Nkcc1 knock-out mice and by bumetanide application
both in mice and rats. The importance of NKCC1 is a
bit of surprise because according to previous data,
NKCC1 expression decreases and KCC2 expression
increases across development (Rivera et al., 1999; Payne
et al., 2003; Yamada et al., 2004). However, recent data
demonstrate enriched NKCC1 in AIS (Wang and Sun,
2012).
The GABAergic excitation as a general phenomenon
was challenged in the CA1 region of the hippocampus
(Glickfeld et al., 2009). To avoid invasive recording, they
used extracellular recordings at multiple locations
along the somatodendritic axis of CA1 pyramidal neurons while GABA was released from an interneuron
whose morphology including axonal arbors was reconstructed after recording. As a rule, GABA was hyperpolarizing to the pyramidal neurons when basket, orienslacunosum molecular and axo-axonic interneurons
generated action potentials. As a minor but important
twist, in one of three axo-axonic interneurons, action
potentials seemed to excite pyramidal cells. This elegant
experiment measured the hyperpolarizing end effect
of GABA released from interneurons in CA1. A similar
conclusion was obtained from an experiment in CA3
(Bazelot et al., 2010).
However, the result from Glickfeld et al. (2009) should
be interpreted with caution. First, the axo-axonic
interneurons were not the primary target of interest
in this work, though this type of interneuron was the
major subtype in the discussion of GABAergic depolarization in cortex (Szabadics et al., 2006). Second,
the depolarizing effect on the AIS is difficult to measure
via extracellular recording. Third, GABA release from
a single action potential is phasic (Marty and Llano,
2005). The effect of sustained GABA release from multiple action potentials was not tested. Fourth, in an
abnormal state, the seemingly insignificant excitatory
GABA machinery can be amplified and cause significant alterations to the circuit activity.
Depending on the active state of the postsynaptic
neurons, the GABA released from an interneuron can
be both excitatory and inhibitory in cortical layer 2/3

L. Chung

(Woodruff et al., 2011). At the resting membrane potential of pyramidal neurons, action potentials from
Chandelier cells were depolarizing and facilitatory for
action potential generation in pyramidal neurons.
However, during a heightened activity state of pyramidal neurons, an action potential from a Chandelier
cell was inhibitory to the pyramidal neuron. This points
out that the dynamic role of GABA is determined by
the temporal context of the recipient.
In sub-regions of hippocampus, differential intrinsic
properties of the neurons were found to be a determinant for excitatory GABA (Sauer et al., 2012). Using
the same technique as Glickfeld et al. (2009) and perforated-patch recordings, they showed that an action
potential from an interneuron synapsing on a DG
pyramidal soma was depolarizing, but in CA1 similar
perisomatic interneuron synapses were hyperpolarizing. The GABA reversal potentials were similar in
CA1 and DG, but the resting membrane potential of
DG pyramidal neurons was more negative than the
GABA reversal potential while that of CA1 pyramidal
neurons was slightly positive relative to the GABA
reversal potential. Under this condition, GABA is depolarizing to DG but hyperpolarizing to CA1 pyramidal
neurons. However, the mechanism underlying how
GABA depolarization becomes excitatory in DG was
not resolved in this study (Sauer et al., 2012). Another
new finding from this work is that perisomatic interneurons can also be excitatory in addition to the axoaxonic interneurons (Szabadics et al., 2006; Woodruff
et al., 2006). The functional meaning of this variable
GABA effect between CA1 and DG remains to be investigated.
It should be noted that most studies above used a
single cell with exogenously applied GABA or a pair of
neurons. In this condition, GABA release rarely evoked
action potentials in the postsynaptic pyramidal neuron.
However, disynaptic excitation after an action potential
from the axo-axonic interneuron was 46% (Szabadics
et al., 2006). This indicates that GABAergic excitation
could be more prevalent in neuronal circuit consisting
of multiple neurons. To study this further in the future,
the essential approach is noninvasive and simultaneous monitoring of multiple interneurons and pyramidal
neurons.

GABAergic EXCITATION IN NEURAL CIRCUIT ACTIVITY FROM MATURE BRAIN
Amygdala is a key brain region for the experience of
emotions including fear and anxiety (Ledoux, 2000;
Johansen et al., 2011). Amygdala and related brain
circuits mediate positive emotions as well, such as

GABAergic Excitation

reward (Baxter and Murray, 2002; Everitt et al., 2003).
Abnormal function of this circuit results in anxiety
and addiction (Davis et al., 2010; Mahan and Ressler,
2012). Synchronous neuronal activity within amygdala
contributes to the generation of emotional states (Pare
et al., 2002).
In basolateral amygdala, an interesting form of neuronal circuit activity has been observed for a while,
but no testable explanation had been suggested until
recently. During voltage clamp recording, bursts of inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) were blocked by
an AMPA receptor antagonist leaving individual IPSCs
intact (Smith and Dudek, 1996). This implies that glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved for burst
IPSC generation. The bursts of IPSC could come from
outside basolateral amygdala or from the GABAergic
interneurons inside the basolateral amygdala. Another
possibility is that burst firing of glutamatergic inputs
inside or outside the basolateral amygdala drives
GABAergic interneurons to fire a group of action potentials accordingly.
In a subsequent study, spontaneous compound inhibitory postsynaptic potential/current (cIPSP/IPSC) with
excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) was observed
in projection neurons and bursts of action potentials
in interneurons (Rainnie, 1999). From this, it could be
postulated that GABA from bursting interneurons
were the source for the cIPSCs. The question remains:
what drives the depolarization and action potentials
in interneurons? Because bursts of action potentials in
projection neurons in basolateral amygdala were rare,
the origin was speculated to be outside the nucleus.
An important, but uncharacterized detail in this study
was about the presumed EPSCs during the cIPSP/Cs.
It could be inward current, but it was difficult to isolate
the inward current because blocking GABAA current
also removed all the cIPSCs themselves. Also the
interneuron type for this phenomenon was not further
pursued, hence it was unclear if any specific type of
interneurons were involved or not (Klausberger and
Somogyi, 2008). This phenomenon appeared in subsequent studies, but the mechanism was not tackled
(Rainnie et al., 2004; Ohshiro et al., 2011; Popescu and
Pare, 2011).
The clue for the generation mechanism came from
an unexpected direction. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an
anxiogenic neuropeptide in animal and human behavior
(Rotzinger and Vaccarino, 2003). When CCK was applied to the amygdala circuit in brain slices, it was
strongly expected to increase excitatory neurotransmission. To the contrary, CCK increased inhibitory
neurotransmission in projection neurons (Chung and
Moore, 2007). In addition to the IPSPs of typical small

2039

amplitudes, they observed puzzling large amplitude
IPSPs in the beginning part of the CCK effect (Fig.
2A).
To characterize the source of IPSPs further, they
directly targeted interneurons in the next study (Chung
and Moore, 2009a). Among the four distinct types of
interneurons, CCK excited three types except one.
Among the three types, spontaneous burstings of action
potentials occurred only in one type of small proportion (about 5%). The burstings were of synaptic origin
because the burstings were gone when synaptic transmission was blocked. The burstings from this type of
interneurons could be the source of the large IPSPs in
the previous report (Chung and Moore, 2007).
Because the anxiogenic effect and inhibitory neurotransmission induced by CCK were difficult to reconcile,
the large IPSP was targeted for further investigation.
However, it was difficult to study the large IPSPs separately because they were present only in half of the
projection neurons after CCK and lasted less than 30
seconds (Chung and Moore, 2007). The phenomenon
could be prolonged by increasing the extracellular K+
concentration from 2.5 mM to 5 mM in the ACSF. Thus,
the large IPSPs evoked by CCK could be associated
with the spontaneous cIPSP/IPSC of the previous
report (Chung and Moore, 2009b; Rainnie, 1999).
The cIPSP is infact cPSP because a group of EPSPs
were always present during the IPSP (Chung and
Moore, 2009b) (Fig. 2B). The temporal order of the
EPSPs and the large amplitude IPSP was variable,
but there should be a mechanism for this temporal relationship. This new concept of a concurrent reciprocal
relationship between excitation and inhibition made
the authors suggest that GABAergic input from the
bursting interneuron excites the glutamatergic projection neuron within the basolateral amydala (Chung
and Moore, 2009b) (Fig. 2C). In this model, GABA
released from the interneuron after action potentials
by CCK or serotonin opens the chloride channels by
GABAA receptor activation. The effect to the postsynaptic glutamatergic neuron is not hyperpolarizing, but
depolarizing and excitatory because of the high [Cl−]i
and efflux of negative Cl−. The action potential from
the glutamatergic neuron further excites the interneuron by activation of AMPA and NMDA type glutamate
receptors on the interneuron to form a positive feedback loop.
If depolarizing GABA was a necessary condition for
the generation of cPSP as predicted from this hypothesis, lowering [Cl−]i will reduce the GABAergic depolarization, thus inhibiting the cPSP generation. Alternatively, if GABA was hyperpolarizing, lowering the chloride concentration will facilitate the cPSP. Bumetanide

potential was manually adjusted with current injection. (C) Schematic model (Chung and Moore, 2009b). cPSPs are generated
by positive feedback between GABAergic interneurons (e.g., axo-axonic cells) and a subset of glutamatergic cells. Increasing
GABAergic transmission (e.g., by CCK or serotonin) initiates action potentials in a subset of glutamate cells (possibly via
synapses on the axon initial segment), which in turn further excite interneurons by activation of AMPA and NMDA receptors.
Thus, projection cells outside the cPSP generation loop (right side) may receive both increased GABAergic and glutamatergic
input. However, bumetanide reduces cPSPs generation by NKCC1 inhibition. NKCC1 inhibition decreases Cl− influx, lowers
Cl− reversal potential, thus makes the GABAAR activation by the interneuron be inhibitory or less excitatory at least.

inhibited the cPSP generation which supports the idea
of GABAergic depolarization (Chung and Moore, 2009b).

Implications
Unexpectedly, the cPSP in amygdala is a very similar phenomenon to that observed in GABAergic depolarization in neonatal hippocampus and in the subiculum from adult human epilepsy patients (Cherubini

et al., 1991; Cohen et al., 2002). It should be stressed
that the cPSP tested in amygdala occurred neither in
neonatal animals nor in animals under seizure. With
regard to seizure, amygdala is a place where the
threshold for kindling is very low (Goddard, 1967;
Okabe et al., 2003; Epps and Weinshenker, 2012).
This suggests that amygdala is equipped with circuit
components that can produce interictal-like neural

GABAergic Excitation

circuit activity with repeated external input. cPSP
could be the corresponding circuit activity with the
GABAergic depolarization property, which can lead to
anxiety or seizure.
This opens the possibility of introducing CCC modulation from hippocampal epilepsy research into emotion related disorders in amygdala. Anxiety drugs,
such as benzodiazepines, already modulate inhibitory
transmission through the Cl− current (Skolnick, 2012).
The modulation of CCCs can provide another therapeutic target for intervention. This is very analogous
to the situation in epilepsy research (Kahle and Staley,
2012). Bumetanide combined with current anti-anxiety
drugs (benzodiazepine, for example) may be a better
approach than the anti-anxiety drug alone.
Another target of manipulation could be the bursting-type interneurons. If we know the unique characteristics present in that type of interneuron, this knowledge can be used to manipulate the interneuron. For
example, if the bursting interneuron has a specific
type of receptors, we can target them as shown in
other classes of interneurons (Freund, 2003; Freund
and Katona, 2007).

CONCLUSION
The idea has gained acceptance that GABAergic
depolarization or excitation is present during early
development and neonatal epilepsy. In contrast, the
possibility of a similar phenomenon in mature brain is
under intense investigation in brain regions including
SCN, cortex, hippocampus and basolateral amygdala. At
neuronal circuit level, the contritubtion of GABAergic
excitation in mature brain was suggested rather recently. GABAergic excitation could be an odd phenomenon deviating from the general rule, but sometimes
the deviants are important in the world of pathology.

Organization of behavior requires rapid coordination of brainstem and forebrain activity. The exact mechanisms of effective
communication between these regions are presently unclear. The intralaminar thalamic nuclei (IL) probably serves as a central
hub in this circuit by connecting the critical brainstem and forebrain areas. We found that GABAergic and glycinergic fibers
ascending from the pontine reticular formation (PRF) of the brainstem evoked fast and reliable inhibition in the IL via large,
multisynaptic terminals. This inhibition was fine-tuned through heterogeneous GABAergic and glycinergic receptor ratios
expressed at individual synapses. Optogenetic activation of PRF axons in the IL of freely moving mice led to behavioral arrest and
transient interruption of awake cortical activity. An afferent system with comparable morphological features was also found in the
human IL. These data reveal an evolutionarily conserved ascending system that gates forebrain activity through fast and powerful
synaptic inhibition of the IL.
Adaptive behavior depends on rapid initiation and termination of
movements requiring fast communication and synchronized activity
between the neocortex (for planning the movements1–3), the basal
ganglia (for switching between behavioral regimes4,5) and the
brainstem (for organization of motor commands6–8). Although
our knowledge of brain circuits that organize motor sequences has
greatly improved in the past decade, relatively little is known about the
mechanisms that actively suspend ongoing behavior9. Furthermore,
behavioral arrest and subsequent immobility are accompanied by the
emergence of various types of slow cortical oscillations10,11, suggesting that stop signals may also induce a standby state in forebrain
circuits. The manner in which cessation of movements is linked to
slow wave activity also remains unclear.
The intralaminar thalamic nuclei (IL) represent a potential key hub
in this system because they receive the highest density of brainstem
inputs in the thalamus12 and have rich connectivity with frontal cortex and basal ganglia13. Injuries to the IL induce severely impaired
movement initiation and can lead to a persistent vegetative state14,15.
Conversely, deep brain stimulation of the IL in human patients with
a minimally conscious state can reinstate voluntary movements16.
However, direct evidence for the involvement of the IL in organizing
behavior is still lacking as a result of our inability to transiently modify
IL activity in a physiologically relevant manner.
Morphological analyses of mice expressing eGFP in glycinergic
neurons have revealed an intense and nucleus-specific glycinergic

innervation of the IL and midline thalamic nuclei17 (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Because most glycinergic projections arise in the brainstem17,
we investigated whether these projections might constitute an inhibitory pathway linking the brainstem and the thalamus and thereby
controlling forebrain neuronal activity.
RESULTS
An inhibitory pathway from the PRF to the thalamus
Glycinergic fibers identified through expression of GlyT2 were found
in both the IL and midline nuclear complexes17 (Supplementary
Fig. 1). More specifically, in the anterior IL, they were distributed in
the centrolateral and paracentral nuclei and spread to the adjacent
paralaminar part of the mediodorsal nucleus. We observed dense
innervation also in the caudal IL (in the parafascicular nucleus)
and scattered fibers in the nucleus posterior. In addition, the midline nuclei (paraventricular, intermediodorsal and centromedial
nuclei) also received glycinergic inputs. We used retrograde neuronal tracing to localize the origin of the glycinergic fibers (n = 6) in
the IL. The largest concentration of IL-projecting Glyt2 (also known
as Slc6a5)-eGFP cells was found in the ipsilateral oral and caudal
pontine reticular nucleus (PnO and PnC, respectively; Fig. 1a–d and
Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). For brevity, we refer to the two nuclei
collectively as PRF. In the ipsilateral PRF, 55.3% of the retrogradely
labeled neurons were Glyt2-eGFP positive (n = 765 cell in 6 animals).
Conversely, anterograde tracing from the PRF (injections centered

inhibitory component in humans, we compared Glyt2-eGFP labeling in mice with post

mortem human thalamic tissue samples
(n = 3) immunostained for GlyT2. The distribution of GlyT2-immunopositive fibers was
markedly similar in the thalamus of mice and man (Fig. 1i–p). Double
immunostaining with calbindin (CB), which labels IL20 revealed that
multiple GlyT2-positive axon terminals innervated IL thalamocortical
cells in both species (Fig. 1l,p).
At the electron microscopic level, Glyt2-eGFP terminals in the mouse
IL (n = 73 terminals in 3 mice) established symmetrical synapses and
puncta adhaerentia with the targeted thalamocortical neurons (Fig. 2a,b).
14 of the 16 terminals (87.5%) reconstructed in three dimensions established multiple (up to 14, mean = 6.7, s.d. = 3.6) closely spaced synapses
(Supplementary Fig. 4a), always with a single postsynaptic partner.
The Glyt2-eGFP terminals innervated significantly thicker dendrites
(mean minor diameter = 0.9 ± 0.2 µm, n = 68) than randomly selected
dendrites in the same neuropil (mean minor diameter = 0.5 µm, s.d. =
0.2 µm, n = 228; χ2 test for homogeneity, P = 2.2 × 10−16, df = 2; Fig. 2c),
indicating that they preferentially contacted proximal dendritic
domains. The number of synaptic contacts correlated with postsynaptic dendrite diameter (linear regression, n = 16, R2 = 0.3354, F = 7.066,
regression df = 1, residual df = 14, P = 0.0187; Fig. 2d) and showed a
tendency to increase with bouton volumes (n = 8; Supplementary Fig. 4b).
In one terminal, up to seven synapses could be found in a 1-µm radius
of a given synapse (n = 19 synapses in 2 boutons, 83 intersynaptic
distances; Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 4c). This synaptic arrangement has been shown in other systems to promote rapid neurotransmitter pooling between active zones21,22. Electron microscopic analysis
of the human tissue revealed that the morphological features of
GlyT2 terminals in the IL matched their rodent counterparts (large
size, multiple active zones, mitochondria and puncta adhaerentia, large
caliber dendritic target; n = 15; Fig. 2f), although the posytsynaptic

modifications appeared to be more complex. These morphological data
indicate that a powerful, evolutionary conserved, inhibitory system
targets IL neurons at strategic, proximal dendritic domains, potentially
controlling synaptic integration and firing.
In the spinal cord, glycine immunoreactivity is frequently colocalized
with GABA23. We therefore investigated the presence of GABA in
Glyt2-eGFP terminals of the mouse IL. Postembedding GABA immuno­
staining revealed that 57 of 58 Glyt2-eGFP–positive terminals displayed
GABA immunoreactivity (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, clusters of glycine
receptors (GlyRs) and of the γ2 subunit of GABAARs (GABAγ2Rs)
were both juxtaposed to Glyt2-eGFP varicosities in the IL (Fig. 2g
and Supplementary Fig. 5). The number of associated GABAγ2R
and GlyR clusters per terminal (3.70 ± 2.45) displayed great variability
(Fig. 2h). About 68% of the terminals were opposed to both GlyR and
GABAγ2R clusters (n = 2,014, 4.57 ± 2.38 clusters), whereas 29% faced
only GABAγ2R (n = 848, 1.89 ± 1.25) and 3% faced only GlyR clusters
(n = 81, 1.12 ± 0.33 clusters per terminal). These data indicate that differential postsynaptic receptor accumulation may fine-tune synaptic
transmission at the mixed inhibitory brainstem-IL synapses.
PRF-thalamic fibers evoke strong, non-depressing inhibition
To study the inhibitory impact of GlyT2 fibers on IL neurons we chose
an optogenetic approach and injected the PRF of BAC transgenic
Glyt2-Cre mice (Supplementary Fig. 6a–c) with adeno-associated
viruses (AAVs) carrying a flex-ChR2-eYFP construct (ChR2-eYFP;
Supplementary Fig. 6d–i). Following viral transgenesis, fibers
expressing ChR2-eYFP were confined to the IL and midline nuclei
(Supplementary Fig. 6j–o) and were immunoreactive for GlyT2,

­confirming the specificity of our approach. We recorded thalamocortical cells of the IL in acute slices prepared from Glyt2-Cre mice
after brainstem injection with the ChR2-eYFP construct (Fig. 3a,b).
Broad field illumination with brief (1–2 ms) flashes of blue light reliably evoked outward synaptic currents, with average amplitudes of
68.45 ± 18.86 pA (n = 14 cells) at −40 mV (Fig. 3c). Light-evoked
inhibitory postsynaptic currents (leIPSCs) followed illumination
onset with short latency (3.09 ± 0.17 ms, n = 14 cells) and rapid rise
and decay times (rise time: 0.54 ± 0.04 ms, n = 14; decay time: 6.18 ±
0.47 ms, n = 20). leIPSCs were blocked by tetrodotoxin (500 nM;
1.87 ± 0.65% of control, n = 7, Wilcoxon signed rank test, P = 0.018,
W(7) = 0). Following co-application of the GABAAR antagonist SR95531
(5 µM) and the GlyR antagonist strychnine (1 µM), the amplitude of the
remaining leIPSCs was reduced to 2.80 ± 0.72% (n = 8 cells, Wilcoxon
signed rank, P = 0.0011, W(8) = 0) of the control value, demonstrating
the inhibitory nature of the optically activated synapses (Fig. 3c).
SR95531 alone decreased the amplitude of leIPSCs, on average, to
56.20 ± 7.55% (n = 22 cells). In individual IL neurons, this value varied between 0 and 100% (Fig. 3d,e), indicating that there was a large
amount of variability in the ration of GABA/glycine receptor expression in IL neurons. Typical of mixed inhibitory synapses, SR95531
shortened the decay of the leIPSCs from 8.76 ± 0.83 ms to 6.18 ±
0.41 ms (n = 13, Wilcoxon signed rank test, P = 0.003, W(13) = 3),
revealing significantly faster kinetics of the glycinergic component
relative to the GABAergic component (Fig. 3f,g). This kinetic difference has been proposed to provide precise inhibitory control over the
postsynaptic neurons24.
Our anatomical analyses revealed that GlyT2 terminals establish
several synapses. Multisynaptic inhibitory terminals are designed to
evoke faithful responses even at high presynaptic firing rates21,22.
Accordingly, we observed that trains of optical stimuli in the IL,
564	

delivered to ChR2-eYFP–expressing PRF fibers, at frequencies of
10–40 Hz reliably evoked leIPSCs trains without apparent decrease in
amplitudes (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Fig. 7a), demonstrating the
absence of prominent short-term depression. We further confirmed
the dynamic behavior of the synapses by electrically evoking IPSCs
(eIPSCs) in the IL following pharmacological isolation of the glycinergic component (Supplementary Fig. 7b,c). The eIPSCs were also
non-depressing at all of the frequencies tested (range, 10–200 Hz).
This indicates that the depression of leIPSCs found at 50 Hz
(Supplementary Fig. 7a,c) was possibly a result of non-physiological
effects of optogenetic activation25 and confirms reliable inhibitory
synaptic transmission at the PRF-IL synapse during high presynaptic
firing rates.
We next tested the efficacy of sustained PRF-thalamic inhibition
in controlling the discharge of thalamocortical IL neurons. leIPSPs
evoked by 1-s stimulation trains at 20 Hz depressed the firing of IL
cells to 32.27 ± 22.86% of the control pre-illumination period (n =
4 cells, paired t test, P = 0.025, t = 4.18; Fig. 3i). Taken together, these
data demonstrate that PRF terminals can exert a fine-tuned, powerful
inhibition in the thalamus, potentially controlling the activity of IL
cells during behavior.
Inhibitory PRF-thalamic fibers evoke behavioral arrest
To study the behavioral effect of the PRF-IL inhibitory pathway,
we optogenetically activated GlyT2 fibers in freely moving animals
through unilateral optic fibers, chronically implanted in the IL. Light
activation of GlyT2 terminals in the IL using 30-Hz stimulation trains
at high laser intensities evoked a near-complete behavioral arrest for
the duration of the stimulation (Supplementary Movie 1). All types
of behavior were suspended (exploration, eating, grooming) 1–2 s
following stimulation onset, whereas the posture of the animals

IL of awake animals for 33 s resulted in a marked modification of the
ongoing cortical electrical activity. The low-amplitude high-frequency
fluctuations, which dominate awake states, were abruptly replaced
by large-amplitude slow oscillations (n = 4 animals, 47 stimulations;
Fig. 5a,b). A significant increase (Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.01)
was evident in the frequency range of 2–6 Hz (Fig. 5c) compared with
pre-illumination periods (Fig. 5c,d). Slow-wave activity disappeared
following the termination of the stimulus (Fig. 5b).
Finally, we measured the neuronal activity of Glyt2-eGFP–positive
neurons in the PRF during slow cortical oscillation in vivo using juxtacellular recording and labeling (n = 11 cells localized in PnO; Fig. 6, and
Supplementary Fig. 10) under ketamine anesthesia, which is known
to reproduce the main features of cortical slow wave oscillation25.
8 of 11 Glyt2-eGFP neurons fired high frequency clusters of action
potentials (frequency, 2–23 Hz; within-cluster frequency, 12–100 Hz;

neurons were activated antidromically from the IL (Supplementary
Fig. 10b). The activity of all Glyt2-eGFP–positive PnO units displaying clustered firing was correlated with the LFP and multiunit
activity measured in the frontal cortex (Fig. 6b and Supplementary
Fig. 10d,f,h). The phase preference of individual Glyt2-eGFP cells
displayed a large heterogeneity and spanned the whole up and down
cycle of the cortical slow oscillation (Fig. 6f). This indicates that,
despite the fact that the majority of Glyt2-eGFP–positive cells activity
is modulated by slow cortical oscillation in resting states, IL neurons
may experience a continuous, tonic bombardment of phasemodulated firing from GlyT2 PnO cells. The data also show that the
within-cluster firing frequency of PRF cells was in the range that was

DISCUSSION
Our experiments identified previously unknown IL-projecting
GABA/glycinergic inhibitory neurons in the brainstem that exerted
powerful control over the IL and cortical activity as well as on ongoing behavior. These neurons provided a link between brainstem and
forebrain movement inhibition centers and promoted the establishment of the resting cortical state, which characterizes inactivity. Our
data point to a conceptually novel form of brainstem-forebrain inter­
action wielding a substantial influence on major executive functions.
This pathway appears to be conserved between mouse and human.
We found marked similarities in the distribution of GlyT2 fibers in
the thalamus, in the thalamic cell type and the dendritic domains
innervated by the GlyT2 fibers, and in the ultrastructure of the
terminals (Figs. 1 and 2). Recent diffusion tensor imaging data in
humans clearly suggest the existence of a substantial ponto-thalamic
pathway that terminates in the IL 18,19, suggesting that the GlyT2
inputs to IL arise from the same sources and are homologous in the
two species. The mouse behavioral data, together with the evolutionary conserved nature of the system, are compatible with the role of
the brainstem and IL in controlling human voluntary movements and
consciousness15,16,26.
PRF-thalamic inhibition with dual inhibitory phenotype
The vast majority of the PRF-thalamic terminals established multiple,
closely spaced synapses and innervated large-caliber, proximal dendrites that allow faithful and reliable synaptic inhibition21,27 in the IL.

a r t ic l e s
Similar to many inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord23, thalamicprojecting PRF cells displayed dual GABA/glycinergic phenotype.
On the postsynaptic side, both the receptor composition at individual
synapses and the synaptic responses of individual IL cells to afferent
activation displayed a heterogeneous GABA/glycinergic ratio (Fig. 3).
Although the neurotransmitter content of presynaptic axons can
influence postsynaptic receptor activation28, preferential expression
of GABAARs or GlyRs by the postsynaptic cell seems to be the main
determinant of the IPSC phenotype in mixed systems29,30. Our anatomical and physiological results also support a postsynaptic choice
for neurotransmitter receptor clustering. Given that GABAergic
and glycinergic IPSCs have different decay time constant, this variability translates to inhibitory responses with variable kinetics. This
allows individual postsynaptic neurons to shape their inhibitory control exerted by mixed GABA/glycinergic input. Kinetic differences
between glycinergic and GABAergic components of PRF-thalamic
IPSCs may also help to tune the inhibition window through nonlinear
interactions of the GABAergic and glycinergic components24. Overall,
the PRF-thalamic inhibitory system is ideally suited to perform fine
control of the thalamo-cortical circuits, but the exact functional consequences of heterogenous inhibitory kinetics to the output of IL at
the systems level remains to be determined.
Inhibitory PRF effects on movements and cortical activity
Behavioral arrest and the emergence of slow-wave activity were
induced by activation of inhibitory PRF fibers in IL (Figs. 4 and 5).
The exact mechanisms underlying these two effects remain to be
established. However, our data are compatible with previous results
indicating that PRF is an important center of movement inhibition
and that PRF may be the origin of an ascending arrest signal31–33.
The thalamic targets of the ascending inhibitory PRF fibers, the
IL, have the necessary connectivity required for the generation of
both behavioral arrest and slow oscillations. One of the main targets
of IL nuclei is the striatum13,34. It has been known that activation of
the indirect striatal pathway leads to movement inhibition35, similar
to the arrest induced in our experiments by PRF fiber stimulation in
the IL (Fig. 4). On the other hand, activation of the direct pathway
produces exacerbated motor activity35. If both pathways are activated
in a balanced manner, movements will again be facilitated36. Given
that IL innervate both the direct and the indirect striatal pathways37
and exert strong excitation on their targets, they may contribute to
this balanced drive observed during movement. As a consequence,
their inhibition by PRF fibers can produce motor disturbances. The
second effect, the emergence of slow-wave activity in the cortex, can
be linked to the intrinsic properties and the cortical projection of IL
thalamocortical neurons13. In general, inhibition of thalamic cells
can lead to spontaneous, slow, rhythmic oscillations38, which could
resonate with the frontal cortical targets of the IL, the most prominent
region for slow cortical activity. It should be noted that the optogenetic activation of PRF axons in the thalamus can also induce anti­
dromic spikes that may propagate to putative non-thalamic targets
of PRF cells. These effects remain to be investigated.
We propose that the two consequences of PRF fiber activation in IL
are functionally linked. Immobility or stand-by states are characterized by various types of slow oscillations10,39. During these inactive
states, ‘offline’ analysis of previously learned events occurs via replay of
the previous neuronal activity, which is temporally coordinated by the
slow oscillations40. It has also been suggested that slow oscillations are
necessary to perform essential neuronal maintenance functions41. In
any scenario, linking behavioral arrest and slow oscillations through a
single control system, the ascending pontothalamic pathway, would be
nature NEUROSCIENCE  VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 4 | APRIL 2015	

beneficial for controlling behavioral and brain states. Finally, it should
be noted that our data do not rule out that the ascending system that
we describe participates in other brain functions, such as arousal,
sleep regulation or pain perception.

ONLINE METHODS

Anatomy. For the tract tracing, receptor localization and electron microscopic
experiments, a total of 25 adult (older than 45 d) male Glyt2-eGFP mice were
used. Mice were entrained to a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water available
ad libitum. Experimental procedures were approved by the Institute of Experimental
Medicine Protection of Research Subjects Committee, the Food Safety and Animal
Health Office of the Pest District Government Bureau (Budapest, Hungary),
the Veterinäramt des Kantons Zürich (Switzerland) or the Centre National de la
Recherche Scientifique (France).

Surgery. Surgery and experiments were done under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia
(ketamine, 83 mg per kg of body weight; xylazine, 3.3 mg per kg).
Retrograde tracing. To identify brainstem neurons projecting to the thalamus,
Fluorogold (FG) was injected iontophoretically (0.6 µA, 2-s on/off period, 10-min
duration) into the intralaminar thalamus of Glyt2-eGFP mice under ketamine/
xylazine anesthesia (n = 6 unilaterally and n = 2 bilaterally; capillary tip diameter =
20 µm), according to the following coordinates: AP, Br −1.5 mm to −1.8 mm;
Lat, 0.7 mm, DV, −3.2 mm. After 3 d, the mice were perfused through the heart using
fixative solution containing 0.1% glutaraldehyde (wt/vol) and 4% paraformalde­
hyde (wt/vol). The thalamus and the brainstem were cut coronally (50–60-µm
slices), cryoprotected and frozen above liquid nitrogen. To identify cortical inputs
to PnO, in a separate set of experiments (n = 4) FG was injected into the PnO
(2 µA, 7-s on/off period, 15-min duration) at the following coordinates: AP,
−4.4 mm; ML, −0.8 to −1 mm; DV, 4.2 mm. After 5–7 d of survival the animals
were perfused and the entire brain was sectioned in the coronal plain.
Anterograde tracing. To visualize pontothalamic fibers, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutine (PHAL, n = 3 unilateral) was iontophoretically injected (4 mA, 7-s
on/off period, 10-min duration) into the oral or caudal pontine nucleus (PnOPnC) of Glyt2-eGFP mice (50-µm capillary tip diameter) using the following
coordinates: AP, Br −4.3 mm to −4.4 mm; Lat, 0.8 mm; V, −4.0 mm. After 1 week,
the animals were perfused and the brains were sectioned as described above.
Immunocytochemistry. Fluorogold was visualized with a rabbit anti-Fluorogold
antibody (1:10,000 to 1:20,000, Chemicon, AB 153) followed by either 1-nm
gold particle–conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:50, Amersham, RPN-470) and silver
intensification (Aurion R-Gent SEM LM-silver enhancement kit, 20–22 min),
or Alexa 594–conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:500, Molecular Probes
A-11012). For identifying the cortico-PnO projection, the primary antiserum
(1:30,000) was followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit (1:300, Vector, BA 1000)
and avidin biotin horseradish peroxidase complex (ABC, 1:300, Vector, PK-6100).
Nickel-intensified di-amino-benzidine (Ni-DAB, black reaction product) was
then used as a chromogen. PHAL was visualized by rabbit anti-PHAL (1:10,000,
Vector, AS-2300), and Alexa 594–conjugated goat anti-rabbit for fluorescent
microscopy.
To visualize Glyt2-eGFP fibers with light microscopy the sections were treated
with mouse anti-eGFP antibody (1:20,000, Molecular Probes, A11120) followed by
biotinylated horse anti-mouse (1:300, Vector, BA 2000), avidin biotin horseradish
peroxidase complex (ABC, 1:300, Vector) and Ni-DAB. To label the post­synaptic
targets of Glyt2-eGFP fibers in the IL, the eGFP-Ni-DAB immunoreaction was
followed by a treatment with rabbit anti-calbindin (1:20,000, Swant, CB 38) and
rabbit ImmPRESS (1:2, Vector, MP-7401). The calbindin immunostaining was
visualized by DAB alone yielding a brown reaction product.
To verify the specificity of the Glyt2-eGFP mouse line, coronal sections of the
thalamus from Glyt2-eGFP mice were treated with guinea pig anti-GlyT2 antibody (1:10,000, Chemicon, AB 1773) followed by Cy3-conjugated donkey antiguinea pig (1:500, Jackson, 706-166-148). All GlyT2-positive terminals examined
(n = 106) displayed eGFP signal, whereas 95% of the eGFP terminals (n = 311)
were immunopositive for GlyT2 (n = 2 animals).
The results of these light microscopic experiments were obtained either with a
Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescent microscope and a digital camera (Olympus DP70),
with a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 microscope coupled to an AxioCam HrC digital
camera, or with a Nikon AR1 confocal microscope.

Tissue fixation. Adult Glyt2-eGFP mice were deeply anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg per kg body weight) and
perfused through the ascending aorta with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
followed by 50 ml of 4% freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde (wt/vol) in
0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Brains were then dissected and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, before embedding in paraffin.
Tissue preparation and labeling. Sections were cut at a thickness of 7 µm. After
removing paraffin, sections were processed in a decloaking chamber (Biocare
Medical) using a citrate buffer–based antigen retrieval medium (Biocare Medical)
for 20 min at 110–115 °C. They were then processed in PBS with 15% methanol (vol/vol) and 0.3% H2O2 (vol/vol) to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
Aldehyde groups were removed by incubating the sections in sodium borohydride
(1%, wt/vol) in PBS. After these treatments, the slices were incubated in a blocking PBS-based solution containing cold-water fish-skin gelatin (0.1%, vol/vol)
and 0.1% Triton X-100 (vol/vol). Tissues were then incubated overnight at 4 °C
with the following primary antibodies: chicken anti-GFP (1:1,000, Aves labs,
GFP 1020), rabbit anti-GABAa receptor gamma 2 subunit (1:1,500, Synaptic
Systems, 224 003), mouse anti-GlyR (1:1,000, Synaptic Systems, 146 011), guinea
pig anti-VIAAT (1:1,500, Synaptic Systems, 113 004 data not shown). Primary
antibodies were revealed by incubation for 2 h with secondary antibodies coupled to either Alexa Fluor-488 (Invitrogen, A-11039) or DyLight 488, (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, 703-485-155) DyLight 549, Jackson ImmunoResearch,
711-505-152 and 715-505-150) and DyLight 649 (Jackson ImmunoResearch,
715-495-150 and 711-495-152). Sections were finally mounted using Prolong
Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen). For all experiments, control sections were
incubated without primary antibodies.
Image acquisition and analysis. Image stacks were acquired using a confocal
microscope (SP2, Leica Microsystems or Nikon A1R) with a 63× oil-immersion
objective. For image deconvolution, point-spread functions (PSFs) for multiple wavelengths were measured with subresolution (175 nm) beads (PS-Speck;
Invitrogen), embedded in 7.5% gelatin and mounted in Prolong Gold. Bead
images were then extracted from image stacks using a custom routine in ImageJ
(W. Rasband, US National Institutes of Health), and averaged. Image stacks of the
regions of interest were deconvolved using the Iterative Deconvolve 3D ImageJ
plugin (R. Dougherty, http://www.optinav.com/imagej.html), and particles were
subsequently analyzed using a custom version of the threshold-based Object
Counter 3D ImageJ plugin (F. Cordelières & J. Jackson, http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/
plugins/track/objects.html). To isolate terminals, images were thresholded, and
axons were removed by erosion. Terminals were then dilated to their original size
and used as masks on the thresholded image to preserve their precise morphologies. Detected particles where defined as regions of interests (ROIs) using the
ImageJ 3D ROI manager42. The global density was measured as the number of
particles divided by the volume of the three-dimensional image stack. To measure
distances between receptors and terminal surfaces, terminals were converted to
three-dimensional binary masks. The masks were then gradually dilated and
the number of particles falling under a mask counted for each step. This count
was then normalized by the volume of the added shell. The resulting distance
density plot were fitted with the sum of a Gaussian function centered close to
zero, representing the clusters associated to the varicosity (putatively on the
postsynaptic element), and of a sigmoidal function of the form Y = 1/(1 + exp(−
(X − A)/X0)), representing randomly distributed clusters in the surrounding
tissue. The receptor clusters specifically associated with a terminal were taken
as those falling within a distance of 600 nm from the terminal. Each ROI was
isolated and the given terminal inflated to the specified distance. Receptors falling
in this volume were then counted.
Results were processed using custom routines written in GNU R
(R Development Core Team, 2013; http://www.r-project.org/) and Matlab
(MathWorks). Since no difference in the measured variables could be observed
between distinct intralaminar nuclei, data were pooled for statistics.
Electron microscopy. To explore the ultrastructure of the axon terminals with
electron microscopy, mice were perfused with a sequential low pH/high pH
fixative including 0.5% glutaraldehyde. eGFP was visualized using the silver­intensified preembedding gold method (mouse anti eGFP 1:1,000 followed by
1-nm gold particle-conjugated goat anti-mouse; for details, see ref. 21). All sections

were treated with OsO4 (0.5%, vol/vol, for 20 min in 4 °C in 0.1 M PBS), dehydrated in ethanol and acetonitrile, and embedded in Durcupan (ACM, Fluka).
Tissue blocks from IL (n = 3) containing silver-intensified gold-labeled terminals
were re-embedded and series of 200–300 ultrathin sections (60 nm thick) were
cut with an Ultramicrotome. Alternate sections were mounted on copper and
nickel grids. Postembedding GABA immunostaining was carried out on nickel
grids as described previously43. Serial electron micrographs were taken with a
Megaview digital camera running on a HITACHI 7100 electron microscope.
For two-dimensional measurements, ITEM software (Olympus Soft Imaging
System) was used. The minor diameters of dendrites targeted by eGFP-­positive
terminals and of randomly selected dendrites were measured in three non­consecutive sections, and compared using the Chi-square homogeneity test.
To establish the possible correlation between the bouton volume and the number
of synapses, the latter were counted in all the sections containing the bouton.
A linear regression was then calculated.
Reconstruct software was applied to reconstruct the terminals in three dimensions. The sections were aligned with the ‘linear alignment’ function that can
partially compensate for individual section distortions caused by sectioning.
Membranes, synapses and the covering surface of associated glia elements were
reconstructed in terminals with preserved ultrastructure. Terminal volume, largest three-dimensional diameter and pair-wise synapse distances along the active
surface were calculated. For further details on reconstructions, see ref. 21.
Processing of human tissue. Control human thalamic tissues (n = 3) were
obtained from a male (74 years old) and two female (59 and 76 years old) subjects
who died from causes not linked to brain diseases. None of them had a history
of neurological disorders. The three subjects were processed for autopsy in
Saint Borbála Hospital, Tatabánya, Department of Pathology. Informed consent
was obtained for the use of brain tissue and for access to medical records for
research purposes. Tissue was obtained and used in a manner compliant with
the Declaration of Helsinki. All procedures were approved by the Regional and
Institutional Committee of Science and Research Ethics of Scientific Council of
Health (ETT TUKEB 31443/2011/EKU (518/PI/11)).
Brains were removed 4–5 h after death. The internal carotid and the vertebral
arteries were cannulated, and the brains were perfused first with physiological
saline (1.5 l in 30 min) containing heparin (5 ml), followed by a fixative solution
containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde and 0.2% picric acid
(vol/vol) in 0.1 M PB, pH = 7.4 (4–5 l in 1.5–2 h). The thalamus was removed
from the brains after perfusion, and was postfixed overnight in the same fixative
solution, except for glutaraldehyde, which was excluded. Subsequently, 50-µmthick coronal sections were obtained for immunohistochemistry using a Leica
VTS-1000 Vibratome (Leica Microsystems). The sections were incubated with a
guinea pig anti-GlyT2 antibody (1:10,000, Chemicon, AB 1773), and the signal
was visualized with the DAB-Ni reaction described above. The sections were
then treated with OsO4 (1.0% for 40 min. in 4 °C in 0.1 M PBS), dehydrated in
ethanol and acetonitrile, and embedded in Durcupan (ACM, Fluka). Ultrathin
sections were cut with an Ultramicrotome from blocks containing GlyT2-­positive
fibers. In some cases, postsynaptic IL neurons were visualized using mouse anticalbindin antiserum and DAB reaction. In these cases, glucose (7%, wt/vol) was
added to the OsO4 solution to preserve the color difference.
Generation of Glyt2-Cre BAC transgenic mice. Glyt2-Cre BAC transgenic mice
have been generated essentially as described previously for the Glyt2-eGFP BAC
transgenic mice17. In brief, homologous recombination in bacteria was used to
introduce the Cre coding sequence into the BAC-DNA (clone RP23-365E4).
Pronuclei of fertilized C57BL/6 oocytes were injected with the modified BAC
DNA. The resulting Glyt2-Cre mouse lines were maintained on a C57BL/6J
background. Cre expression pattern was compared to the expression of eGFP in
the well-characterized Glyt2-eGFP mouse line. In the CNS of Glyt2-Cre / Glyt2eGFP double transgenic mice Cre expression was highly overlapping with eGFP
expression (Foster, E., H.W., Broll, I., Haueter, S., Tudeau, L., Jegen, M., Bösl, M.R.
& H.U.Z., unpublished observations). Genotyping was performed with the following primers; GlyT2Cre-fwd 5-GGGTGACCAAGGTAGGCTGAATG-3 and
GlyT2Cre-rev 5-CCTGGCGATCCCTGAACATG-3.
The selectivity of CRE expression was also demonstrated by crossing the
Glyt2-Cre and the Glyt2-eGFP mice lines and performing immunostaining for the
Cre-protein (mouse anti-CRE, 1:10,000. Millipore, followed by Cy3-conjugated

donkey anti-mouse, 1:500, 715-165-151). We found that, of 198 Cre-positive
neurons, 196 (99%) were also eGFP positive (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Stereotactic injections. All optogenetic experiments were performed on adult
(>3 months old) Glyt2-Cre mice. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal
injection of ketamine-xylazine (200 and 10 mg per kg) and placed inside a stereo­
tactic apparatus (Kopf Instruments). An AAV2/1.EF1α.DIO.hChR2(H134R).eYFP
virus, based on Addgene plasmid 20298 and produced at the Laboratory of Gene
Therapy (INSERM UMR 1089), was injected in the right side of the PnO, at the
following coordinates: Bregma ML, +0.7 mm ; AP, 4.3 mm; DV, −4.8 mm. For the
in vivo control experiments described in Figure 4, PnO neurons were transfected
using an AAV2/1.EF1α.DIO.eYFP virus, based on Addgene plasmid 27056 and
produced by the Vector Core facility of the University of Pennsylvania.
Injections were performed using pipettes pulled from graduated capillaries,
at a rate of 100–150 nl min−1 for a total volume of 1.5–2 µl. In vitro and in vivo
optogenetic stimulation experiments were all performed at least 4 weeks after
viral injection.
Slice preparation. In vitro electrophysiological experiments were performed on
coronal slices from the thalamus of virus injected Glyt2-Cre mice. Slices were prepared as described previously29. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isofluorane
before decapitation. After isolation, the portion of the brain containing the thalamus was placed in bicarbonate-buffered saline (BBS) at 2–5 °C for a few minutes.
Slices (300 µm) were then cut using an HM650V vibratome (Microm). The slicing
procedure was performed in an ice-cold solution containing (in mM): 130 potassium gluconate, 15 KCl, 0.05 EGTA, 20 Hepes, 25 glucose, 1 CaCl2 and 6 MgCl2,
supplemented with 0.05 D-APV, and tetrodotoxin at 200 nM. Slices were then
transferred for a few minutes to a solution containing (in mM): 225 d-mannitol,
2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 25 glucose, 1 CaCl2 and 6 MgCl2, and finally
stored for the rest of the experimental day at 33 °C in oxygenated BBS, containing: 115 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.6 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3 and
30 glucose (pH 7.4 after equilibration with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). For all recordings, slices were continuously superfused with oxygenated BBS at 32–34 °C.
Electrophysiology and in vitro optogenetic stimulation. In vitro electrophysio­
logical recordings were preferentially performed from cells of the central lateral and the parafascicular nuclei. The nuclei were clearly recognizable by the
distribution of ChR2-eYFP–positive fibers following virus injection in the pons.
Cells were identified and patched in the transmitted deep red light with which
slices were visualized using a CoolSnap HQ CCD camera (Photometrics) run by
Metamorph software (Universal Imaging) and mounted on a Slicescope microscope (Scientifica). Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries and had a resistance of 4–6 MΩ. Light-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents
(leIPSCs) were recorded in the voltage-clamp configuration using an intracellular solution containing the following (in mM): 120 D-gluconic acid, 100 CsOH,
1 TEA-OH, 10 Hepes, 6 NaCl, 16 BAPTA, 0.1 QX314-Cl, 1 CaCl2, 10 potassium
phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, pH adjusted to 7.35 with CsOH with a
final osmolarity of 295–305 mOsm. For the current clamp experiments described
in Figure 2, the following intracellular solution was used (in mM): 135 KMeSO4,
3 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 potassium phosphocreatine, 10 Hepes, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-ATP
pH adjusted to 7.35 with KOH with a final osmolarity of 295-305 mOsm.
The brief (1–2 ms long) flashes of blue light used to evoke leIPSCs were
provided by triggering either a lambda DG-4 device (Sutter Instruments), or
a 470-nm wavelength LED (Thorlabs) coupled to the slice chamber via the epi­
fluorescence pathway of the microscope. Recruitment of axons was observed up
to full-field powers of 11.5 mW, with a threshold of around 0.25 mW.
All electrophysiological recordings were performed with a double EPC-10
amplifier (Heka Elektronik) run by Patchmaster (Heka). Sampling frequency
was 40 kHz. Data were filtered at 3 kHz. All data were analyzed using Igor
(Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) and with routines developed in-house.
Statistical comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test, the
Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired sets of data and in the case of the data of
Figure 3i–j, a paired t test. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. Results are
given as mean ± s.e.m.
Anesthesia and surgery. 11 adult male C57Bl/6J BAC Glyt2-eGFP mice (20–30 g)
were used for the experiments. Surgeries and experiments were done under

ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Initially, mice received intraperitoneal injection
of ketamine (111 mg per kg) and xylazine (4.3 mg per kg). For the maintenance
of the anesthesia, intramuscular injection of ketamine/xylazine was given every
30–50 min during the entire duration of the experiments.
In vivo juxtacellular recording and labeling, local field potential (LFP) recording. Bipolar LFP electrodes (FHC, resistance ~1 MΩ) were placed into the frontal
cortex of mice (AP: +1.7 mm, L: −0.8 mm from Bregma). The recorded signal was
amplified, band-pass filtered from 0.16 Hz to 5 kHz and from 100 Hz to 5 kHz to
record the fast multiunit activity (Supertech BioAmp, Supertech) and digitized at
20 kHz (micro 1401 mkii, CED). Concentric bipolar stimulating electrodes were
inserted into the IL (Bregma AP, −1.5 mm; ML, 2 mm; DV, −3.2 mm tilted at
20 degrees, electrode separation 0.8 mm). PnO single unit activity was recorded
by glass microelectrodes (in vivo impedance of 20–40 MΩ) pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5-mm outer diameter, 0.75- or 0.86-mm inner diameter,
Sutter Instrument or WPI) and filled with 0.5 M potassium acetate and 2% neurobiotin (wt/vol, Vector Laboratories). Electrodes were lowered by a piezoelectric
microdrive (Burleigh 6000 ULN or ISS 8200, EXFO) into the PnO (Bregma AP,
−4.4 mm; ML, 0.8–1.0 mm; DV, −3.8–4.8 mm). Neuronal signals were amplified by a DC amplifier (Axoclamp 2B, Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA), further amplified and filtered between 0.16 Hz and 5 kHz
by a signal conditioner (LinearAmp, Supertech). Neuronal signals were recorded
by Spike2 5.0 (CED). Juxtacellular labeling of the recorded neurons was done as
described previously44. Following perfusion, coronal sections (50 µm) were cut
from the PnO and the neurons were visualized by Cy3-conjugated streptavidin
(1:2,000, Jackson). Glyt2-eGFP positivity was determined by confocal microscope.
The neurons were then developed using ABC and DAB-Ni, and the sections
containing the labeled neurons were dehydrated and embedded in Durcupan.
The dendritic trees of the labeled neurons were reconstructed using Neurolucida
5.2 software (MBF Bioscience).
Analysis. To determine the action potential clusters of the PnO cells, we used a
built-in script of Spike2 7.0 (CED) software. We identified clusters by separating
the two peaks at the minimum of the bimodal interspike interval histograms
(ISI). Cortical population activity was dominated by the cortical slow oscillation
(quasi-periodic alternation of active, ‘UP’, and inactive, ‘DOWN’, states) in the
anesthetized animals. We determined the phase of each action potential relative
to this oscillation for the recorded neurons as described previously45. Briefly, the
envelope of the cortical multiunit trace (MUA envelope) was low-pass filtered at
4 Hz using a zero phase-shift finite impulse response filter; the Hilbert-­transform
of the filtered and z-scored MUA envelope was calculated and the phase was
determined by taking the angle of the complex ‘analytic signal’. The prime advantage of this method is that it estimates the phase of any quasi-rhythmic signal in
a temporally refined manner, defining a time series that quantifies the ‘instantaneous phase’ of the ongoing oscillation46. The circular mean angle was calculated for each recorded neuron47 and the inter-quartile range was determined as
±25 percentile around the circular mean.
In vivo optogenetics. 4 weeks after transfection of PnO cells with either a ChR2eYFP or eYFP virus, Glyt2-Cre animals were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine
(100 and 5 mg per kg) and placed in a stereotactic frame. Once exposed, the skull
was cleaned with H2O2 and covered with a layer of Super Bond C&B (Morita).
A craniotomy was performed over the right hemisphere and an optic fiber
(200 µm, 0.22 NA) housed inside a connectorized implant (M3, Doric Lenses)
was lowered over the caudal thalamic central lateral nucleus (Bregma −2.0 AP,
+0.8 ML, −2.8 DV). The craniotomy was covered with a drop of warm agarose
gel (2%), and the implant was secured with dental acrylic (Pi-Ku-Plast HP 36,
Bredent). The skin was stitched at the rear and front of the implant and the animal
was allowed to recover on a heating pad. Mice were allowed to recover for at least
5 d before testing.
The following custom optical system was used for fiber optic light delivery in
freely moving mice: the beam generated by a 473-nm DPSS laser (LRS-0473-PFM00100-03, Laserglow Technologies) was passed through an acousto-optic tunable

doi:10.1038/nn.3951

filter (AOTFnC-400.650-TN, AA Opto-Electronic) controlled by a multi digital
synthesizer (MDS4C-D66-22-74.158-RS), allowing accurate and silent light pulse
generation. The first order beam exiting the AOTF was bounced on mirrors and
directed into the core of a fiber optic patchcord (200 µm, 0.37 NA) through a custom table-top rotary joint (Doric Lenses). The patchcord (1.6 m) was connected
to the mouse and allowed to rotate passively. With adequate beam alignment,
rotations induced power fluctuations of less than 5% at the fiber output. The
power density measured at the output of the delivery fiber was 318 mW mm−2
for 200-µm-diameter optic fiber (behavioral experiments) and 1,272.73 mW
mm−2 for the 100-µm-diameter fiber (electrophysiological experiments).
For motility tests, each mouse was tested in six sessions, with a maximum of
one session per day. During each session, mice were allowed to move freely on an
open white platform while being filmed continuously via a CCD camera (Guppy
Pro, Allied Vision) and exposed to 10-s trains of 5-ms light pulses delivered at
30 Hz every minute for 15 min. Photostimulation trains were signaled on the
video recording by an infrared LED. All aspects of the experiment (photostimulation waveform generation, MDS and LED control, video recording) were controlled using LabVIEW (National Instruments). Movies were analyzed off-line with
Ethovision (Noldus Technology) to extract animal trajectories and speed profiles.
Statistical comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test or the
Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired sets of data.
To record cortical LFP signals from freely moving animals we implanted bipolar electrodes into the frontal cortex. We used screws placed above the cerebellum
as a reference and ground. Both the LFP recording electrodes and the reference
and ground electrodes were soldered to an 18 Position Dual Row Male NanoMiniature Connector (A79014-001, Omnetics Connector). The optic fiber was
lowered into the intralaminar thalamus. The whole implant was fixed with dental acrylic and surrounded with copper grid. For LFP measurements, 30-s-long
stimulations were used (3–5 stimulations per d with 5–10 min between them). To
record the LFP signals, we used a 128-channel amplifier (Amplipex). For wavelet
generation, we used homemade MatLab scripts.
Statistics. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U
test, the Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired sets of data and in the case of the
data of Figure 3i–j, a paired t test. Statistical significance was set at 0.05 but
the exact values are reported. Results are given as mean ± s.e.m. No statistical
­methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar
to those reported in previous publications21,27,35. Equal variances were not
formally tested. For the behavior experiments, mice were randomly assigned
to hChR2.eYFP and eYFP groups. For anatomical, in vitro and in vivo physiological
experiments, no exclusion criteria was applied for the initial selection and
data were collected randomly. All physiology data were processed by automated
software, eliminating the possibility of biases in data processing. The experimenters were not blind to the conditions of the animals.

The thalamic reticular (RE) nucleus is a key structure in the generation of spindles, a hallmark bioelectrical oscillation during early
stages of sleep. Intracellular recordings of RE neurons in vivo
revealed the presence of prolonged hyperpolarizing potentials
preceding spindles in a subgroup (30%) of neurons. These hyperpolarizations (6 –10 mV) lasted for 200 –300 ms and were present
just before the onset of spontaneously occurring spindle waves.
Corticothalamic volleys also were effective in generating such
hyperpolarizations followed by spindles in RE neurons. A drop of
up to 40% in the apparent input resistance (Rin) was associated
with these hyperpolarizing potentials, suggesting an active process rather than disfacilitation. Accordingly, the reversal potential
was approximately ؊100 mV for both spontaneous and cortically
elicited hyperpolarizations, consistent with the activation of slow
K؉ conductances. QX-314 in the recording pipettes decreased both
the amplitude and incidence of prolonged hyperpolarizations,
suggesting the participation of G protein-dependent K؉ currents in
the generation of hyperpolarizations. Simultaneous extracellular
and intracellular recordings in the RE nucleus demonstrated that
some RE neurons discharged during the hyperpolarizations and,
thus, may be implicated in their generation. The prolonged hyperpolarizations preceding spindles may play a role in the transition
from tonic to bursting firing of RE neurons within a range of
membrane potential (؊60 to ؊65 mV) at which they set favorable
conditions for the generation of low-threshold spike bursts that
initiate spindle sequences. These data are further arguments for
the generation of spindles within the thalamic RE nucleus.

S

pindles (7–15 Hz) are a hallmark oscillation during early
sleep states. During the past two decades, a series of studies
have demonstrated that spindles are generated within the thalamic reticular (RE) nucleus, which is uniquely composed of
neurons using ␥-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as neurotransmitter. Spindles are transferred to the cerebral cortex through the
interactions between RE and thalamocortical neurons. Thus,
experimental evidence has shown that spindles are abolished in
thalamocortical systems after lesions of RE neurons or transections separating them from thalamocortical neurons (1) but
survive in the RE nucleus deafferented from the dorsal thalamus
and cerebral cortex (2). Computational studies agreed with the
initiation of spindle rhythmicity in the isolated RE nucleus (3–5)
and suggested that, at relatively hyperpolarized levels of membrane potential (Vm), as is the case during slow-wave sleep, the
inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) between RE neurons
can be reversed, and GABAA-mediated depolarizing potentials
can generate persistent spatio-temporal patterns in the RE
nucleus (6). The transfer of spindles from the RE nucleus, which
is devoid of cortical projections, to the cerebral cortex is caused
by RE cells’ interactions with thalamocortical neurons (7–9).
The mechanisms underlying spindle initiation in the RE
nucleus are not completely elucidated. Our hypothesis (2)
predicted that hyperpolarization of RE cells’ dendrites through
dendrodendritic synapses of GABAergic RE neurons (10, 11)
would deinactivate a low-threshold Ca2ϩ conductance, triggering
a Ca2ϩ spike followed by GABA exocytosis and hyperpolarization in postsynaptic RE cells’ dendrites. The hyperpolarization
in synaptically coupled dendrites was thought to initiate spindle

oscillation and to spread it to adjacent elements. In essence, any
idea aiming at explaining the genesis of spindles in the isolated
network of RE neurons implicates the possibility that active RE
neurons would hyperpolarize adjacent neurons and create an
avalanche spread of the oscillation within the nucleus, with
ultimate implication of target thalamocortical neurons. The
source for activating a set of RE neurons that would hyperpolarize adjacent and͞or more distant RE neurons may be any
excitatory synaptic drive acting on these cells but primarily the
neocortex, which is known for being particularly potent in
triggering (12) and synchronizing (13) spindles.
In the present experiments, by using intracellular recordings in
vivo in the rostrolateral sector of the cat RE nucleus, we show the
presence of spontaneous as well as cortically elicited prolonged
hyperpolarizing potentials (PHPs) leading to the onset of spindle
oscillations in a sample (30%) of RE neurons. These hyperpolarizations were associated with a decrease in the apparent input
resistance (Rin), thus suggesting an active inhibition rather than
disfacilitation. Extracellularly recorded RE neurons in the vicinity
of the intracellularly recorded neurons showed that their firing was
temporally related with the hyperpolarization leading to spindles.
We propose that the prolonged hyperpolarizations are part of the
mechanisms that initiate spindles within the RE nucleus.
Methods
Preparation. Experiments were performed on adult cats (2.5–3.5

kg), anesthetized with pentobarbital (25 mg͞kg, i.p.). When the
cats showed ocular and electroencephalogram (EEG) signs of
deep anesthesia, the animals were paralyzed with gallamine
triethiodide and artificially ventilated with control of the endtidal CO2 concentration at Ϸ3.5%. Body temperature was
maintained at 36–38°C. The depth of anesthesia was monitored
continuously by EEG, and additional doses of anesthetics were
administered at the slightest tendency toward activated (lowvoltage and fast EEG) rhythms. At the end of experiments,
animals were given a lethal dose of pentobarbital (50 mg͞kg).
Recordings and Stimulation. Current–clamp intracellular recordings from thalamic RE and relay neurons were performed with
glass micropipettes [direct current (DC) resistance, 30–60 M⍀].
To avoid breaking of recording micropipettes, the cortex and
white matter overlying the head of the caudate nucleus were
removed by suction. The pipettes entered Ϸ3 mm through the
caudate nucleus to reach the rostral pole or the rostrolateral
sector of the thalamic RE nucleus. Pipettes generally were filled
with 3 M solution of K-acetate and, in some experiments, with
50 mM of QX-314 (Sigma). The stability of intracellular recordings was ensured by cisternal drainage, bilateral pneumothorax,
hip suspension, and filling the hole over the thalamus with 4%

agar solution. A high-impedance amplifier with active bridge
circuitry was used to record and inject current inside the cells.
Most intracellular recordings included in the database lasted for
periods longer than 30 min.
For simultaneous extracellular unit recordings, tungsten electrodes (10–15 M⍀; Frederick Haer, Bowdoinham, WA) were
inserted through the caudate nucleus, 0.5–1 mm rostrolateral to
the intracellular recording micropipette. RE neurons were recognized by their long (Ͼ50-ms) and typical accelerando–
decelerando spike bursts in both intracellular and extracellular
recordings (see Figs. 1 A and 5B).
Electrical stimulation of corticothalamic fibers was performed
by descending one or two bipolar stimulating electrodes to the
internal capsule and applying current pulses (200 ␮s, 500–1,000
␮A, 0.5–1 Hz).
The Rin was estimated as follows. Synaptic responses evoked
by stimulation of cortical areas or corticothalamic fibers were
recorded under different levels of membrane polarization obtained by current injection through the pipette (from Ϫ1 to ϩ 1
nA steady current). I–V curves were built by plotting the holding
Vm against different levels of DC injected. Plots were made for
multiple time intervals, generally in increments of 10 ms, before
and after stimulation onset. For each plot, a linear function was
fitted whose slope was considered to be the apparent Rin for that
particular time interval (see Fig. 1C).
Data Analysis. All data analysis was performed with IGOR PRO 4.0

(WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Values are expressed as
mean Ϯ SD, and t tests were used to assess statistical differences,
when necessary. Differences were considered as significant at
P Ͻ 0.05.
Results
were able to generate spontaneously low-threshold spikes (LTSs)
without current injection. The neuron depicted in Fig. 1A was
recorded at a Vm of Ϫ79 mV and generated prolonged spike bursts
(Ͼ50 ms; Fig. 1 A Inset) that occurred during spindle waves.
A subgroup of the recorded RE neurons (32%; 10 of 31)
displayed PHPs preceding spontaneously occurring spindle oscillations. One of those neurons is illustrated in Fig. 1 A and shows
simultaneous occurrence of spindles in the EEG and intracellular
recording. The neuron displayed prolonged hyperpolarizations
before every single spindle sequence. Generally, however, hyperpolarizations preceded spindles in only Ϸ60% of cases (see below,
Fig. 3D). The initial phase of the hyperpolarization was rather
constant, but the late part was variable, because rebound activity in
the network was evident as depolarizing events with different
amplitudes in the intracellular recording (Fig. 1 A, arrowhead in
superimposition). The activation of the hyperpolarization could be
well fitted with a single exponential function (time constant, ␶ ϭ 36
ms) and its duration was Ϸ300 ms (Fig. 1 A). The average ␶ for the
activation of the hyperpolarization was 42 Ϯ 4.8 ms (n ϭ 5) and the
duration was 200–300 ms (n ϭ 10).
The hyperpolarizations favored the occurrence of bursting behavior in RE cells. The neuron in Fig. 1B was slightly depolarized
with positive current injection through the pipette to induce continuous, tonic firing. This discharge pattern was present until the
onset of spindle waves, when spontaneous membrane hyperpolarization was followed by robust bursting discharges. Therefore,
hyperpolarization was able to switch the neuronal firing pattern
from tonic to bursting, because it likely deinactivated the Ca2ϩdependent T-current (14–17) so that incoming inputs, probably
excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) of cortical or dorsal
thalamic origin, could elicit LTSs. Then, the hyperpolarization is a
mechanism for switching discharge patterns in RE neurons from
tonic to bursting (Fig. 1B), thus contributing to generation of

reach the threshold of postinhibitory rebound spike bursts indicated
that hyperpolarization is effective in controlling the transition from
tonic to bursting discharges within a narrow band of Vm (Ϫ60 to
Ϫ65 mV; data not shown).

tive in generating spindle oscillations (12, 18). The same type of
electrical stimulation also was able to induce hyperpolarizations
preceding spindles in all tested neurons (n ϭ 5). In such cases,
an initial EPSP preceded a prolonged hyperpolarization, which
was followed by spindles (Fig. 1C). Averaged responses to
corticothalamic stimulation demonstrated similar durations and
amplitudes for spontaneous and evoked hyperpolarizations (Fig.
1, compare panels A and C). Recent in vitro data also indicate
that focal stimulation of cortical layer VI produces di- or
polysynaptic inhibitory currents in RE neurons (19).
During the prolonged hyperpolarizations, the apparent Rin of
RE neurons could drop by 40% (32 Ϯ 12%, n ϭ 5; Fig. 1C Lower
Right), suggesting it to be the result of active inhibition processes
rather than disfacilitation in the network.
Voltage Dependency of Prolonged Hyperpolarizations. To determine
the voltage dependence of hyperpolarizations, different levels of
Vm were attained in intracellular recordings by injecting steady
current through the recording pipette. For each of such levels,
the amplitude of hyperpolarizations was measured at the holding
Vm. Fig. 2 shows a representative example where a RE neuron
was studied by this procedure. Fig. 2 A displays the spindles that
follow the spontaneous hyperpolarizations, marked by asterisks,
whereas Fig. 2B shows expanded traces for hyperpolarizations at

different Vms. The hyperpolarization displayed higher amplitude
as Vm was depolarized, which is consistent with the activation of
inhibitory conductances. At more negative values of the Vm, the
hyperpolarization became progressively smaller until it was
virtually abolished around Ϫ100 mV to Ϫ105 mV (Fig. 2 A–C).
The reversal potential (Vrev) was estimated by the extrapolation
of a linear fitting to the I–V curve (Fig. 2C). Even though there
was large variability in the voltage dependency of hyperpolarizations among different RE neurons, the Vrev remained similar
in most cases (Vrev ϭ Ϫ103 Ϯ 4. 6 mV; n ϭ 5), a value similar
to the expected Vrev for Kϩ in these cells (20, 21). Similar to the
case of spontaneously occurring hyperpolarizations, the voltage
dependency of evoked ones proved to be consistent with the
activation of Kϩ conductances: such hyperpolarizations reversed
at similar Vm values compared with spontaneously occurring
ones (Vrev ϭ Ϫ101 Ϯ 2.7 mV; n ϭ 5) (Fig. 2C).
Ionic Basis of Prolonged Hyperpolarizations. To elucidate some

aspects of the ionic bases of prolonged hyperpolarizations,
intracellular recordings were performed with the inclusion of
QX-314 (50 mM) in the pipette. QX-314 is a blocker of multiple
membrane conductances, including some Kϩ currents (see Discussion). In the three neurons recorded under QX-314, in which
hyperpolarizations preceding spindles could be detected, both
the amplitude and incidence of hyperpolarizations were decreased. During the initial period of recording (2–5 min), RE
neurons displayed full action potentials coincident with spindle
waves preceded by hyperpolarizations (Fig. 3A, control). As time
elapsed (15–60 min), QX-314 blocked Naϩ currents and, thus,
decreased the spikes’ amplitudes during spindles (Fig. 3A, QX314). Not only the action potentials but also the preceding
hyperpolarizations were affected, showing decreased amplitudes

fluctuations, it displayed depolarizing potentials, likely EPSPs (Fig.
4B) that occasionally led to the action potentials that preceded the
hyperpolarization (see Fig. 4A). Electrical stimulation of corticothalamic fibers was effective in mimicking the spontaneous behavior as, on stimulation, EPSPs were evoked, followed by hyperpolarization and subsequent spindling (Fig. 4C).
The occurrence of spontaneous hyperpolarizations heralded
Ϸ60% of spindles recorded in RE neurons (Fig. 4D). However,
in two RE neurons, such hyperpolarizations could be detected
preceding every single spindle (see Fig. 1). On the other hand,
evoked spindles always were preceded by hyperpolarizations
(Fig. 4D) when corticothalamic fibers (Fig. 4C) or cortical areas
(Fig. 1C) were stimulated. Only half of hyperpolarizations
preceding spindles were initiated by an EPSP (Fig. 4D), suggesting that corticothalamic inputs are important for the generation of such hyperpolarizations but not obligatory.

spindles in each neuron that displayed PHPs (PHP; 57.2 Ϯ 16.7%), and bars on the

18.4%). For each cell, the fraction was calculated from 30 to 50 spindle oscillations. Note that evoked spindles are always preceded by PHPs and EPSPs.

(Fig. 3A, QX-314). Rebound activity occurring during the late
part of hyperpolarizations also was affected by QX-314, displaying decreased incidence (Fig. 3B). Averages (n ϭ 10) of hyperpolarizations selected from initial (Fig. 3C, control) and late
(Fig. 3C, QX-314) periods of recordings with QX-314 showed a
2-fold decrease in amplitude of hyperpolarizations preceding
spontaneous spindles (Fig. 3D).

EPSPs. RE neurons occasionally fired single spikes just before the

onset of prolonged hyperpolarizations. In Fig. 4A, a RE neuron was
depolarized by current injection (ϩ0.3 nA) and discharged tonic
spikes just before the onset of the PHP preceding spindles. When

cerebral cortex as a probable source for the generation of
hyperpolarizations (see Figs. 1C and 4C), their direct origin
within the RE nucleus remained to be determined because both
thalamic and cortical inputs to RE neurons are glutamatergic,
therefore excitatory in nature. To support the hypothesis of
intra-RE origin of these PHPs, three pairs of simultaneous
extracellular and intracellular recordings could be performed in
the RE nucleus, to study local activities within the RE network
during the hyperpolarizations preceding spindle oscillations.
One of such paired recordings is depicted in Fig. 5, showing the
intracellular activity of one RE neuron and extracellular activities of at least two RE units. In most cases, at least one
extracellularly recorded unit fired before the onset of the
intracellular spindles, the discharge being temporally related
with the prolonged hyperpolarization heralding the spindle
sequence in the intracellularly recorded neuron (Fig. 5 A and B).
The hyperpolarizations preceding the first three spindle sequences in Fig. 5A were temporally associated with firing of one
extracellularly recorded unit (a), whereas the last hyperpolarization was accompanied by firing of the second extracellularly
recorded unit (b). These events are expanded in Fig. 5B.
Autocorrelograms for action potentials showed that intracellular and both extracellular units presented oscillatory activity in
the range of spindle activities (7–14 Hz), as seen by clear
presence of secondary peaks at Ϯ 110 ms (Ϸ9 Hz, Fig. 5C). The
crosscorrelation for spikes showed that both extracellularly
recorded units fired in phase, usually one of them (b) preceding
the firing of the other (a) (Fig. 5D). However, both units
generally preceded the activity in the intracellular recording
(Fig. 5C). Consistent with extracellular discharges preceding
those in the intracellular recording, the extracellular recordings
showed spiking activity at the beginning and throughout the
prolonged hyperpolarizations (Fig. 5D). Therefore, the latter
were correlated with action potential discharges in nearby
and͞or distant locations in the RE nucleus, suggesting that these
potentials may be locally generated within the RE network.
Discussion
We demonstrated the presence of a prolonged hyperpolarization
that precedes spindle oscillations in one third of RE neurons.
These hyperpolarizations (i) were detected in spontaneous spindle waves but also were induced by activation of corticothalamic
projections, in which case they were preceded by EPSPs; (ii) were
associated with decreased neuronal Rin, displayed Vrev around
Ϫ100 mV, and were sensitive to intracellular QX-314, suggesting
the implication of G protein-dependent Kϩ currents; (iii) may act
as a switch between tonic and bursting discharge modes in RE
neurons; and (iv) could have a local direct presynaptic origin,
because of the discharges of other RE neurons.

Both spontaneously occurring and evoked hyperpolarizations
produced a significant drop in the Rin of RE neurons, suggesting the
involvement of active conductances. Therefore, disfacilitation, like
that occurring in cortical (22) and thalamic (23) neurons during the
slow oscillation in natural sleep or anesthesia, can be discarded as
a possible mechanism underlying the prolonged hyperpolarizations
leading to spindles in RE neurons. The Vrev (around Ϫ100 mV) of
RE neurons’ hyperpolarization suggests the activation of Kϩ conductances (20, 21). The Vrev for GABAA-mediated inhibitory
postsynaptic potentials in RE cells was estimated at Ϫ70 mV (6, 24,
25). At that range of Vm, the hyperpolarization preceding spindles
displayed significant amplitude, thus discarding the role of
GABAA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in their generation. Moreover, the I–V relation for this hyperpolarization was
linear for a large range of Vm values (Ϫ100 mV to Ϫ50 mV),
implying a very small contribution, if any, of GABAA-mediated
9820 ͉ www.pnas.org͞cgi͞doi͞10.1073͞pnas.0402761101

potentials at Vm more depolarized than Ϫ70 mV. QX-314 in the
pipette decreased both their amplitude and incidence, consistent
with the activation of Kϩ conductances during the prolonged
hyperpolarizations. QX-314 affects a wide range of membrane
conductances, including the blockade of fast and persistent Naϩ
currents (26), low- and high-voltage activated Ca2ϩ currents (27),
Kϩ currents (28, 29), and hyperpolarization-activated currents (30).
It is unlikely that depolarizing (Ca2ϩ and Naϩ) currents are
implicated in the genesis of the prolonged hyperpolarizations. On
the other hand, it has been shown that QX-314 also blocks G
protein-activated, inwardly rectifying Kϩ channels (31). This opens
the possibility that the prolonged hyperpolarization in RE neurons
is an inhibitory potential activated by G protein coupled to second
messenger cascades (32). Candidates for such an effect are GABAB
receptors (21) as well as peptidergic receptors for somatostatin (33)
and neuropeptide Y (34), which are expressed by RE neurons (35,
36) and may initiate second-messenger cascades that end up in the
activation of G protein-activated, inwardly rectifying Kϩ channels
(32, 37, 38). The case of GABAB receptors might be controversial,
because in vitro experiments have shown that young rodents express
very little GABAB postsynaptic responses in RE neurons (21).
However, those experiments did not assess a critical point, that is,
how much GABAB conductance is activated during thalamic
oscillations when large populations of neurons fire in synchrony (13,
18). And experiments in ferret slices have shown that GABAB
responses to glutamate applied in the perigeniculate sector of the
RE nucleus are not so small, as the rebound spike bursts were
blocked by an antagonist of GABAB receptors (39). Therefore, the
possibility that the RE nucleus expresses a significant GABAB
response during spindle oscillations cannot be discarded. Because
we cannot determine the precise ionic bases of prolonged hyperpolarizations preceding spindles in RE neurons, we suggest that at
least some of the above-mentioned receptors for GABA, somatostatin, and neuropeptide Y may trigger these hyperpolarizations.
Experimental evidence and computational models have
shown that soma and dendrites of RE neurons are electrically
compartmentalized (40) and, because the RE cells’ soma must
be strongly hyperpolarized to generate LTSs (41), the T-current
is located in dendrites (16, 40). A similar reasoning suggests that
the hyperpolarizations preceding spindles may have a dendritic
origin because, in some cases, strong soma depolarization did not
increase their amplitude but abolished them, leaving instead a
low-frequency discharge period (data not shown). Indeed, G
protein-activated, inwardly rectifying Kϩ channels (31) may
mediate dendritic hyperpolarizations (34).
The simultaneous intra- and extracellular recordings in the
present experiments demonstrated that some RE neurons fire
spike bursts that were temporally related to the hyperpolarizations in adjacent neurons. These data suggest that some
hyperpolarizations leading to spindles are generated within the
RE nucleus. Because corticothalamic excitatory volleys also
could elicit such hyperpolarizations and knowing the propensity of cortex to evoke spindling (12, 13, 18), we propose that
firing in some cortical neuronal pools may excite RE neurons,
generating EPSPs and, in some cases, LTSs crowned by spike
bursts, which would generate prolonged hyperpolarizations in
adjacent and͞or distant RE neurons. There is indeed evidence
for both dendrodendritic (10, 11) and axoaxonic synapses
(42), which mediate inhibitory interactions in the RE nucleus
(25, 39).
In sum, the present demonstration of prolonged hyperpolarizations leading to spindles and generated locally in the RE
nucleus is in keeping with the proposal that spindles are initiated
in the pacemaking RE nucleus (2, 7, 43).

combining molecular biological, electrophysiological, immunological, and computer modeling techniques, we here demonstrate a counterbalancing contribution of TASK channels, underlying hyperpolarizing Kϩ leak currents, and HCN channels, underlying depolarizing
Ih, to the resting membrane potential of thalamocortical relay (TC)
neurons. RT-PCR experiments revealed the expression of TASK1,
TASK3, and HCN1– 4. Quantitative determination of mRNA expression levels and immunocytochemical staining demonstrated that
TASK3 and HCN2 channels represent the dominant thalamic isoforms and are coexpressed in TC neurons. Extracellular acidification,
a standard procedure to inhibit TASK channels, blocked a TASK
current masked by additional action on HCN channels. Only in the
presence of the HCN blocker ZD7288 was the pH-sensitive component typical for a TASK current, i.e., outward rectification and current
reversal at the Kϩ equilibrium potential. In a similar way extracellular
acidification was able to shift the activity pattern of TC neurons from
burst to tonic firing only during block of Ih or genetic knock out of
HCN channels. A single compartmental computer model of TC
neurons simulated the counterbalancing influence of TASK and HCN
on the resting membrane potential. It is concluded that TASK3 and
HCN2 channels stabilize the membrane potential by a mutual functional interaction, that the most efficient way to regulate the membrane potential of TC neurons is the converse modulation of TASK
and HCN channels, and that TC neurons are potentially more resistant
to insults accompanied by extracellular pH shifts in comparison to
other CNS regions.
INTRODUCTION

Despite its fundamental importance, rather little is known
about the ionic conductances underlying the resting membrane potential of central neurons. In general, the resting
potential is assumed to be determined by channels active
below firing threshold, with Ih (Pape 1996) and IK-leak (Jones
1989) playing major roles. Modulation of currents active
below threshold is of particular interest because neuronal

excitability is regulated in this manner. Recently the molecular nature of Ih and IK-leak was illuminated by the cloning
of four members of the HCN channel family giving rise to
native Ih currents in neurons and heart cells (Craven and
Zagotta 2006) and five members of the TASK channel
family, typically giving rise to highly regulated time- and
voltage-independent Kϩ background currents (Patel and
Lazdunski 2004). Depending on their sensitivity to changes
in extracellular pH and based on sequence homologies
TASK1, TASK3, and TASK5 channels constitute one subclass (Lesage 2003). Despite this progress in understanding,
the molecular constituents and functional interaction of
IK-leak and Ih in specific cell types are yet not well understood.
Thalamocortical relay (TC) neurons offer a model system to
gain our understanding of membrane currents that constitute
the resting membrane potential for the following reasons. 1)
TC neurons display large state-dependent shifts in membrane
potential that are associated with a change from rhythmic burst
firing at hyperpolarized potentials during slow-wave sleep to
tonic single-spike activity at depolarized potentials during
wakefulness (Steriade et al. 1997). Most important, the depolarization-induced cessation of burst activity depends on the
downregulation of IK-leak and the upregulation of Ih by a
number of transmitters of the ascending arousal system of the
brain stem (McCormick 1992). Because of their important
function as targets of multiple regulatory pathways, IK-leak and
Ih are in the main focus of the present study. 2) Previous studies
have begun to unravel the functional roles of HCN and TASK
channels in TC neurons. Although it was shown that inhibition
of TASK1 and TASK3 channels depolarize TC neurons,
thereby preferring tonic single spike activity (Meuth et al.
2003, 2006), the genetic knock out or block of the HCN2
channels hyperpolarizes TC neurons, thereby preferring burst
firing (Ludwig et al. 2003). 3) The pH dependency of HCN
(Zong et al. 2001) and TASK (Rajan et al. 2000) channels and
their corresponding membrane currents (Meuth et al. 2003;
Munsch and Pape 1999) offer an experimental tool to probe
this mutual functional interaction. Therefore we used extracellular acidification, molecular biological, electrophysiological,
and computer modeling techniques to demonstrate the contriThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment

bution of HCN2 and TASK3/TASK1 channels to the regulation of the resting membrane potential in TC neurons.
METHODS

Drugs
ZD7288
[4-(N-ethyl-N-phenylamino)-1,2-dimethyl-6-(methylamino) pyridinium chloride; Biotrend, Cologne, Germany] was directly dissolved in the external recording solution.

Preparation

Computer simulations with NEURON

Rats and mice (postnatal days 12-–29) were anesthetized with
halothane, decapitated, and used for electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and molecular biological analysis. A block of tissue
containing the thalamus was removed and placed in ice-cold saline,
containing (in mM): Sucrose, 200; PIPES, 20; KCl, 2.5; NaH2PO4,
1.25; MgSO4, 10; CaCl2, 0.5; and dextrose, 10; pH 7.35 with NaOH.
Thalamic slices were prepared as coronal sections on a vibratome.
Before recording, slices were kept submerged in standard artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): NaCl, 125; KCl, 2.5;
NaH2PO4, 1.25; NaHCO3, 24; MgSO4, 2; CaCl2, 2; and dextrose, 10;
pH adjusted to 7.35 by bubbling with a mixture of 95% O2-5% CO2.

For computer simulations, a previously described single-compartment TC neuron model (Huguenard and McCormick 1992; McCormick and Huguenard 1992) was adapted to NEURON (Hines and
Carnevale 2001; Meuth et al. 2005). The model is based on the
mathematical description of IA, IK2, IC, IL, IT, INaP, and Ih and displays
the two typical modes of action potential generation in thalamic cells:
burst firing with two to six action potentials riding on a low-threshold
Ca2ϩ spike (LTS) and single-spike activity with tonic trains of action
potentials. This well-established model was extended by incorporating
the inward rectifying current IKir of the Hodgkin–Huxley form (Williams et al. 1997) and the background potassium current ITASK. The
general equation describing the membrane potential over the time is
C m͑dV/dt͒ ϭ Ϫ(Ileak ϩ ITASK ϩ IKir ϩ Ih) ϩ Iinject

Whole cell patch-clamp recordings
Recordings were performed on visually identified TC neurons of
the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) at room temperature.
Slices were recorded in a solution containing (in mM): NaCl, 120;
KCl, 2.5; NaH2PO4, 1.25; HEPES, 30; MgSO4, 2; CaCl2, 2; and
dextrose, 10; pH 7.3 or 6.3 was adjusted with HCl. Electrical activity
was measured with pipettes pulled from borosilicate glass (GC150T10, Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, UK), connected to
an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lamprecht, Germany), and
filled with (in mM): K-gluconate, 95; K3-citrate, 20; NaCl, 10;
HEPES, 10; MgCl2, 1; Ca Cl2, 0.5; BAPTA, 3; Mg-ATP, 3; and
Na-GTP, 0.5. The internal solution was set to a pH of 7.25 with KOH
and an osmolality of 295 mOsm/kg. Typical electrode resistance was
2–3 M⍀, with an access resistance in the range of 5–15 M⍀. Series
resistance compensation of Ͼ40% was routinely used. Electrophysiological experiments were governed by Pulse software (HEKA Elektronik) operating on an IBM-compatible PC. A liquid junction potential of 8 Ϯ 1 mV (n ϭ 6) was taken into account.
Ih was activated using hyperpolarizing voltage steps from a holding
potential of Ϫ43 to Ϫ133 mV in 10-mV increments. To increase
stability of whole cell recordings the pulse length was decreased by
1,500 ms with increasing depth of the hyperpolarization (3.5-s pulse
length at Ϫ130 mV). Steady-state activation of Ih activation, p(V), was
estimated by normalizing the tail current amplitudes (I), 50 ms after
stepping to a constant potential from a variable amplitude step using
the following equation
p͑V͒ ϭ ͑I Ϫ Imin͒/͑Imax Ϫ Imin͒

where Imax is the tail current amplitude for the voltage step from Ϫ133
to Ϫ98 mV and Imin is the voltage step from Ϫ43 to Ϫ98 mV,
respectively. Ih activation was usually well accounted for a Boltzmann
distribution of the following form
p͑V͒ ϭ 1/͕1 ϩ exp͓͑V Ϫ Vh͒/k͔͖

where Vh is the voltage of half-maximal activation and k is the slope
factor.
During current-clamp recordings the instantaneous frequency (f) of
action potential generation was determined by analyzing the first two
action potentials elicited by a depolarizing current pulse.
All results are presented as means Ϯ SE. Substance effects were
tested for statistical significance using the nonparametric Mann–
Whitney test. Where applicable (Gaussian distribution of measured
values), a parametric t-test modified for small samples was used.
Differences were considered statistically significant at P Ͻ 0.05.

where Cm is the membrane capacitance and Iinject is the injection
current. The noninactivating current IKir was modeled as previously
described (Williams et al. 1997)
I Kir ϭ gKirma͑V Ϫ EKir͒

where gKir is the maximal conductance of the current IKir, whereas m
is the activation variable, and a is its exponent (ϭ3). EKir is the
reversal potential of the current IKir. The outwardly rectifying pHsensitive leak current ITASK was modeled as a mathematical fit
through the currents measured in the current publication
I TASK ϭ gTASKm͑V Ϫ ETASK͒

where gTASK is the maximal conductance of the current ITASK,
whereas the driving force is defined as reversal potential ETASK
subtracted from the membrane potential V. The activation variable m
is defined as
m ϭ y 0 ϩ A 1 e ͑x/t 1͒ /͑V Ϫ ETASK͒

All values were assumed for maximal conductances and fixed reversal
potentials and were systematically varied in some simulations. To
demonstrate the contribution of the leak potassium current ITASK to
the total leak of TC neurons, we calculated a pH-insensitive (gleak)
and a pH-sensitive leak (gTASK) conductance, respectively. The proportion of both leaks was changed systematically to achieve a model
that simulates the pH effect in rat TC neurons. All computer modeling
was carried out at 35°C.
The magnitude of pH-dependent effects on TASK (90% reduction)
and HCN (25% reduction) channels used in computer modeling were
estimated from previously published data. The reduction of Ih resulting from an intracellular shift of 0.8 pH units is roughly 25% (Munsch
and Pape 1999). Both, TASK1 and TASK3 channels are inhibited by
acidification, although over different pH ranges (pK values Ϸ7.5 and
Ϸ6.7 for TASK1 and TASK3, respectively) (Duprat et al. 1997; Kim
et al. 2000; Rajan et al. 2000). Tandem-linked heterodimeric TASK
channel constructs displayed pH sensitivity (pK Ϸ 7.3) closer to that
of TASK1 than to TASK3 (Berg et al. 2004; Czirjak and Enyedi
2002). Therefore TASK1 and TASK3 channels reveal 95 and 75%
inhibition at pH 6.4, respectively, and an intermediate value of 90%
was used for modeling.

salt solution (HBSS, without Ca/Mg). After triple washing with 5 ml
HBSS each, 2.0 ml HBSS, containing 0.5% trypsin, was added to the
tissue, followed by incubation at 37°C for 20 min. Tissue was washed
again five times with 5 ml HBSS each and finally transferred into 2-ml
tubes with HBSS, containing 0.01% DNAseI. To dissociate thalamic
tissue, it was pressed slowly three times through a 0.9-mm-gauge
needle followed by three passages through a 0.45-mm-gauge needle.
The remaining cell suspension was poured through a nylon tissue
(mesh aperture 125 ␮m) into a 50-ml tube and filled up with 18 ml
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco, Eggenstein,
Germany). After estimating cell quantity, the suspension was diluted
with DMEM in accordance to the required density of 16,000 cells/ml.
A 500-␮l aliquot of this suspension was placed on each well of a
24-well plate, containing defatted, baked, and poly-D-lysine– coated
coverslips. The cell cultures were incubated at 37.0°C and 5% CO2 up
to the appropriate time points and finally fixed with 4% perfluoroalkoxy polymer resin (PFA) for 10 min.

In a first experimental step, the expression of different HCN
and TASK channel isoforms was determined through RT-PCR
analysis on dLGN tissue. Strong signals for TASK1 and
TASK3 were found, whereas TASK2 was less expressed and
TASK5 was not detectable (Fig. 1A, left). To determine the
expression of TASK isoforms on a more quantitative level, we
subjected TASK1 and TASK3 mRNAs to a real-time PCR
approach. Expression levels of TASK3 were 4.4 Ϯ 0.2-fold
(n ϭ 3) higher compared with TASK1 (Fig. 1D, left) after
normalization to the constitutively expressed housekeeping
gene ␤2-microglobulin. Similar expression ratios were found
for cortical (3.6 Ϯ 0.1; n ϭ 3) and hippocampal (3.5 Ϯ 0.1;
n ϭ 3) tissues that were used for comparison (data not shown).
When cerebellar tissue, known to express high levels of
TASK1, was tested, the TASK3/TASK1 expression ratio was
0.7 Ϯ 0.1 (n ϭ 3). Expression of HCN channels was assessed
in a similar way. Standard PCR protocols revealed the expression of all four HCN isoforms (Fig. 1A, right). Real-time PCR
was used to attain more quantitative results of isoform expression. The expression level of HCN2 could be assessed to be

7.5 Ϯ 0.1-fold higher compared with HCN3 and HCN4, and
12 Ϯ 0.1-fold (n ϭ 3) higher compared with HCN1 (Fig. 1D,
right). Together with earlier results obtained from HCN2deficient mice (Ludwig et al. 2003), TASK1-deficient mice
(Meuth et al. 2006), and Long–Evans rats (Meuth et al. 2003)
we concluded that HCN2 and TASK3 are the dominant isoforms in dLGN.
The expression of other members of the K2P family of ion
channels (Patel and Lazdunski 2004) was probed by RT-PCR
on the tissue level. The use of specific primer pairs revealed the
presence of TREK-1, TREK-2, TRAAK, THIK-1, and THIK-2
mRNA in dLGN tissue (Fig. 1B).
Next, the cellular localization of HCN2 and TASK3 channels was determined. Neurons were acutely isolated from the
dLGN, TC neurons were identified in populations of neurons
using established criteria (Pape et al. 1994), and groups of 10
TC neurons were harvested for RT-PCR analysis. The use of
HCN2- and TASK3-specific primer pairs revealed detectable
PCR signals for the two ion channels (Fig. 1C). Furthermore,
TASK3- and HCN2-specific antibodies revealed a dense population of HCN2 (716 Ϯ 17 cells/mm2; Fig, 1G, middle image)
and TASK3 607 Ϯ 29 cells/mm2; Fig. 1G, left image) expressing cells in dLGN slices (five independent preparations). Furthermore the overlap of images revealed 604 Ϯ 26 cells/mm2
(Fig, 1G, right image) with co-localization of both channels.
The average cell density in Nissl staining was 808 Ϯ 31
cells/mm2 (n ϭ 6; coronal sections of 14 ␮m thickness),
indicating that 89, 75, and 75% of the cells express HCN2,
TASK3, and HCN2/TASK3, respectively, thereby providing
evidence for largely overlapping expression. In thalamic cell
cultures (DIV 21), 100% of TC neurons (a total of 30 TC
neurons were identified in 10 different cultures from three
independent preparations) were positive for TASK3 (Fig. 1E,
left image) and HCN2 (Fig. 1E, middle image). Their localization in TC neurons (a total of 24 cells were identified in eight

1521

different cultures from three independent preparations) was
further demonstrated by the finding that parvalbumin (Fig. 1F,
bottom left image), a specific marker protein of TC neurons
(Jones and Hendry 1989; Meuth et al. 2005; Sieg et al. 1998),
was expressed in TASK3- (Fig. 1F, top right image) and
MAP2-positive neurons (Fig. 1E, top left image).
Characterization of pH-sensitive ramp currents
In the following extracellular pH changes from a physiological value of 7.3 (control) to 6.3, a value that is reached during
ischemic insults (Siemkowicz and Hansen 1981) were used to
demonstrate the functional interaction of HCN and TASK
channels in TC neurons. Because currents through HCN and
TASK channels are sensitive to extracellular acidification
(Malcolm et al. 2003; Meuth et al. 2003; Stevens et al. 2001),
this experimental paradigm results in a concomitant downregulation of both IK-leak and Ih. Currents through TASK channels
were evoked by holding TC neurons at Ϫ30 mV and ramping
the potential in 800 ms to Ϫ120 mV once every 20 s (Fig. 2A,
inset). The rate of hyperpolarization 0.11 mV/ms is sufficiently
slow to allow the membrane current to reach steady state at
each potential and it is expected that only constitutively open
channels can follow the ramp (Millar et al. 2000; Watkins and
Mathie 1996). The current–voltage (I–V) relationship of the
pH-sensitive current was obtained by subtracting currents recorded at pH 6.3 from control currents (i.e., pH 7.3 Ϫ pH 6.3).
The I–V relationship of the pH-sensitive currents (about 10 min
after extracellular acidification) was characterized by outward
rectification (Fig. 2A, gray trace) and a reversal potential of
Ϫ90 Ϯ 2 mV (n ϭ 10; Fig. 2B, gray circle), i.e., some 14 mV
positive to the expected Kϩ equilibrium potential (EK ϭ Ϫ104
mV). To demonstrate that pH-dependent regulation of Ih contributed to the deviation the HCN channel blocker ZD7288 was
used. Incubation of TC neurons with 100 ␮M ZD7288 before

MEUTH ET AL.

extracellular acidification was performed resulted in an I–V
relationship of pH-sensitive ramps that revealed the typical
features of a current carried by TASK channels (Meuth et al.
2003), including pronounced outward rectification (Fig. 2A, black
trace) and a significantly (P Ͻ 0.0001) more hyperpolarized
reversal potential of Ϫ103 Ϯ 2 mV (n ϭ 8; Fig. 2B, black square),
i.e., close to the expected Kϩ equilibrium potential.
To directly prove the modulation of HCN channels by extracellular acidification, we activated Ih from a holding potential of
Ϫ43 mV by using hyperpolarizing voltage steps of increasing
(⌬V ϭ Ϫ10 mV) amplitude and decreasing (⌬t ϭ Ϫ1,500 ms)
duration (15.5 s at Ϫ53 mV to 3.5 s at Ϫ133 mV) followed by a
constant step to Ϫ98 mV (Fig. 2C, inset). Recordings were
performed in the presence of 150 ␮M Ba2ϩ to block TASK and
inward rectifier channels (Meuth et al. 2003). An analysis of
deactivating currents revealed a half-maximal value of Ih activation at a membrane potential of Ϫ87 Ϯ 2 mV (n ϭ 7) at pH 7.3
(Fig. 2D, black squares). Ten minutes after switching the extracellular solution from pH 7.3 to pH 6.3, half-maximal activation
of Ih was significantly (P ϭ 0.00001) shifted to Ϫ100 Ϯ 1 mV
(n ϭ 7; Fig. 2D, gray circles). To ensure that this effect was not
a result of run-down phenomena, Ih protocols were delivered in
10-min intervals under control conditions in a different set of
experiments. No significant (P ϭ 0.153) differences could be
found under these recording conditions (first protocol: Ϫ86 Ϯ 3
mV; second protocol: Ϫ84 Ϯ 3 mV; n ϭ 4; data not shown). In
conclusion these findings indicated a contribution of both HCN
and TASK channels to the pH-sensitive current component in
dLGN TC neurons and point to an opposing functional influence
on membrane excitability.

Effect of extracellular acidification on thalamic
activity modes
The functional consequence of concomitant modulation of
HCN and TASK channels by acidification was probed under
current-clamp conditions. To ensure robust burst responses,
recordings were obtained at slightly hyperpolarized values (VH ϭ
Ϫ73 Ϯ 1 mV, n ϭ 12; Fig. 3A) of the membrane potential with
respect to the resting value (VR) of Ϫ71 Ϯ 1 mV (n ϭ 25; Fig.
3A) using DC injection. Under these conditions, depolarizing
current steps elicited high-frequency (fH ϭ 134 Ϯ 10 Hz, n ϭ
6; Fig. 3B) bursts with two to five action potentials riding on
top of a low-threshold Ca2ϩ spike (Fig. 3C). Changing the
extracellular pH from 7.3 to 6.3 resulted in a nonsignificant
depolarization of the membrane potential to VpH6.3 ϭ Ϫ68 Ϯ
1 mV (Fig. 3A), during which burst firing (fpH6.3 ϭ 113 Ϯ 1
Hz; Fig. 3B) was preserved (Fig. 3D; n ϭ 5). Different results
were obtained in the presence of ZD7288. Application of
ZD7288 resulted in a significant (P Ͻ 0.01) hyperpolarization
of the resting membrane potential (VZD) to Ϫ79 Ϯ 2 mV (n ϭ
7; Fig. 3A). After bringing the membrane potential back to the
control level of about Ϫ72 mV using DC current injection, a
step depolarization revealed that burst firing (fZD/H ϭ 136 Ϯ 11
Hz; n ϭ 6; Fig. 3B) persisted (Fig. 3E). Subsequent extracellular acidification resulted in a strong depolarization of the
membrane potential (VZD/pH6.3) to Ϫ52 Ϯ 3 mV (n ϭ 6; Fig.
3A) accompanied by a change in firing mode from burst to
tonic (fZD/pH6.3 ϭ 32 Ϯ Hz, n ϭ 6; Fig. 3, B and F). These
findings show that extracellular acidification results in a net
depolarization of TC neurons. The magnitude and, in consequence, the functional relevance of this depolarization is controlled by an interplay between TASK and HCN channels. The

and generation of tonic trains of action potentials in
response to the same depolarizing current pulse in the
presence (F), but not in the absence (D), of ZD7288.

INTERACTION OF TASK AND HCN CHANNELS

main characteristics of the two thalamic activity modes with
high-frequency burst firing at hyperpolarized potentials and
low-frequency tonic firing at depolarized potentials were unchanged.
Next the role of the HCN2 isoform was assessed through the
use of a mouse strain deficient of HCN2 channels (HCN2Ϫ/Ϫ)
(Ludwig et al. 2003). The resting membrane potentials of TC
neurons in wild-type (HCN2ϩ/ϩ) mice (VR/HCN2ϩ/ϩ ϭ Ϫ69 Ϯ
1 mV, n ϭ 22; Fig. 4A) were significantly (P Ͻ 0.01) more
positive compared with HCN2Ϫ/Ϫ mice (VR/HCN2Ϫ/Ϫ ϭ
Ϫ81 Ϯ 1 mV, n ϭ 21; Fig. 4A), confirming previous findings
(Ludwig et al. 2003). A change of extracellular pH from 7.3 to
6.3 in cells held at a potential (VH) of Ϫ73 Ϯ 1 mV using DC
current injection (n ϭ 8; Fig. 4, A and C) resulted in a
nonsignificant hyperpolarization of the membrane potential
(VpH6.3/HCN2ϩ/ϩ) to Ϫ75 Ϯ 1 mV in HCN2ϩ/ϩ mice (n ϭ 6;
Fig. 4, A and D). At pH 7.3 and pH 6.3 cells fired highfrequency bursts of action potentials with intraburst frequencies of fHCN2ϩ/ϩ ϭ 114 Ϯ 2 Hz and fpH6.3/HCN2ϩ/ϩ ϭ 111 Ϯ
6 Hz, respectively (n ϭ 6; Fig. 4B). In HCN2Ϫ/Ϫ mice held at
Ϫ73 mV under control conditions the intraburst frequency was
fHCN2Ϫ/Ϫ ϭ 111 Ϯ 2 Hz (n ϭ 5; Fig. 4, B and E). At pH 6.3
TC neurons were significantly (P Ͻ 0.01) more depolarized
with VpH6.3/HCNϪ/Ϫ ϭ Ϫ58 Ϯ 2 mV (n ϭ 5; Fig. 4, A and F)
and revealed tonic firing (fpH6.3/HCN2Ϫ/Ϫ ϭ 33 Ϯ 7 Hz, n ϭ 5;
Fig. 4, B and F). These data indicate that HCN2 channels carry
a major part of Ih function in TC neurons.
Steady-state current components in TC neurons
Ion channels suitable to determine VR should be able to
sustain a steady-state current. To determine the contribution of

1523

different current components, cells were kept at a holding
potential of Ϫ68 mV. Under these recording conditions TC
neurons displayed a standing outward current (ISO) with an
amplitude of 71 Ϯ 4 pA (n ϭ 10). In a first experimental step,
a pharmacological profile of this current was obtained by
cumulative application of different ion channel modulators.
Figure 5 shows the time course of a typical experiment (Fig.
5A, open squares). Washin of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 ␮M) had
no effect, application of the Ih channel blocker ZD7288 (100
␮M) significantly increased, and lowering the extracellular pH
from 7.3 to 6.3 significantly decreased ISO. Addition of Ba2ϩ
(150 ␮M) and tetraethylammonium (TEA, 20 mM)/4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 6 mM) resulted in a further significant reduction of the outward current.
To increase outward current amplitudes, recordings were obtained at more depolarized values of the membrane potential. At
Ϫ28 mV (Fig. 5A, closed squares), ISO averaged 343 Ϯ 15 pA
(n ϭ 51). TTX (1 ␮M) resulted in an increase in current amplitude
of 7 Ϯ 1% (n ϭ 9) and additional application of ZD7288 (100
␮M) decreased the current (6 Ϯ 2%, n ϭ 9). Changing the
external pH from 7.3 to 6.3 in the continuous presence of TTX
and ZD7288 induced a further decrease by 42 Ϯ 3% (n ϭ 5).
Addition of Ba2ϩ (150 ␮M) and TEA (20 mM)/4-AP (6 mM) led
to a further decrease by 49 Ϯ 6 and 82 Ϯ 5% (n ϭ 5),
respectively. All drug effects were statistically significant with
respect to current amplitudes under control conditions. In the
presence of all blocking agents, the current was almost completely
blocked (9 Ϯ 5 pA residual current; n ϭ 5). These results are
consistent with the hypothesis that Naϩ channels, Ih channels,
pH-sensitive TASK channels, Ba2ϩ-sensitive Kir and leak channels, and TEA/4AP-sensitive voltage-dependent Kϩ channels

pH 7.3 (C) and pH 6.3 (D). E and F: in TC neurons
from HCN2Ϫ/Ϫ mice pulse depolarization elicited a
burst response at pH 7.3 (E). Extracellular acidification resulted in a depolarizing shift of the membrane
potential and generation of tonic trains of action
potentials in response to the same depolarizing current pulse (F).

constitute ISO in TC neurons with the degree of their contribution
depending on the value of the holding potential.
Computer modeling of steady-state current in TC neurons
We modified an existing TC neuron model (Huguenard and
McCormick 1992; McCormick and Huguenard 1992) by adding an inward rectifier Kϩ current (Williams et al. 1997) and
substituting the linear characteristic of IK-leak by a Goldman–
Hodgkin–Katz (GHK) formalism (Meuth et al. 2005). Furthermore we made 49% of IK-leak (default value ϭ 10 nS) sensitive
to changes in pH and designated this component as the outwardly rectifying TASK current (ITASK). This assumption was
based on previous and above findings indicating that the
current through TASK channels makes up about 38 –59% of
ISO in rodent TC neurons (Meuth et al. 2003, 2006; Musset et
al. 2006).
Next, the consecutive pharmacological manipulation of ISO
was analyzed using the model cell. Current changes at a
holding potentials of Ϫ68 mV (Fig. 5B) and Ϫ28 mV (Fig. 5C)
were compared with averaged experimental data (black lines,
n ϭ 5). Although a 90% reduction of INaP (TTX effect) resulted
in a 16% increase in ISO at Ϫ28 mV with no effect at Ϫ68 mV,
90% block of Ih (ZD7288 effect) had no effect at Ϫ28 mV but
increased ISO by 22% at Ϫ68 mV. Reduction (the remaining
current is stated in %) of ITASK, IKir, IK-leak, and the delayed
rectifier Kϩ current (IDR) was used to simulate extracellular
acidification (ITASK: 25%), block by Ba2ϩ (ITASK: 0%; IKir:
10%; IK-leak: 90%), and block by TEA/4-AP (IKir: 0%; IK-leak:
70%; IDR: 55%). In addition the transient Kϩ outward current
(IA) was assumed to be completely 4-AP sensitive. As shown
in Fig. 5, B and C, the model cell (gray lines) reliably describes
the qualitative changes of ISO in rats (black lines) with a mean
deviation between modeled and measured current amplitudes
of 12 Ϯ 2% (n ϭ 10; averaged over all experimental conditions
at two holding potentials).
Next we used computer modeling techniques to assess the
relative contribution of HCN and TASK channels to the pH
effects. The resting membrane potential of the model cell was
J Neurophysiol • VOL

V1 ϭ Ϫ72 mV (Fig. 6A). From this potential a step depolarization evoked a low-threshold Ca2ϩ spike and a high-frequency burst (f1 ϭ 102 Hz; Fig. 6B) of action potentials (Fig.
6C). The effect of extracellular acidification was simulated by
simultaneously reducing the maximal conductance of Ih and
ITASK by 25% (Munsch and Pape 1999) and 90% (Meuth et al.
2003) of their initial values, respectively. As a result the
membrane potential of the model cell depolarized to V2 ϭ Ϫ68
mV (Fig. 6A) with burst firing (f2 ϭ 112 Hz; Fig. 6B) being
preserved (Fig. 6D). Next, the block of HCN channels by
ZD7288 was simulated by removing Ih from the computer
model, resulting in membrane hyperpolarization to V3 ϭ Ϫ82
mV (Fig. 6A). Using DC-current injection the membrane potential of the model cell was reset to V3/DC ϭ Ϫ72 mV (Fig.
6A) and a subsequent step depolarization elicited a burst
response (f3/DC ϭ 105 Hz; Fig. 6, B and E). Next, extracellular
acidification was simulated by removing 90% of ITASK, thereby
leading to a depolarization of the membrane potential to Ϫ58
mV (Fig. 6A) accompanied by tonic firing (f4/DC ϭ 19 Hz; Fig.
6, B and F). In an additional set of simulations the upregulation
of Ih (e.g., by cAMP) was modeled by increasing the default
value of Ih conductance by 25% (data not shown). As a
consequence the resting membrane potential of the model cell
was depolarized to V1 ϭ Ϫ70 mV. Simulation of extracellular
acidification depolarized the membrane potential to V2 ϭ Ϫ66
mV, thereby shifting the model to an intermediate firing mode
(LTS crowned by a single action potential and followed by
tonic firing of three action potentials).
Taken together these findings indicate an opposing interaction of TASK3/TASK1 and HCN2 channels to stabilize the
resting membrane potential of TC neurons.
Because a number of components contribute to ISO we
expanded our modeling approach. Different combinations of
hyperpolarizing (IKir, IK-leak, ITASK) and depolarizing (Ih, INaP)
currents were modulated and compared with the effect seen in
rats (Fig. 7). The following experimental conditions were
analyzed: 1) Control conditions represent VR of the model cell
(Ϫ72 mV) and mean VR of rat TC neurons (Ϫ71 Ϯ 1 mV, n ϭ

6.3) both 25 and 90% reductions of Ih and ITASK were assumed
in native cells, respectively. Therefore in the model cell the
indicated depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current was reduced by 25 and 90%, respectively. The resulting changes in

VR are shown. 3) The block of Ih hyperpolarizes native TC
neurons and the model cell. To reach the control level of VM
(about Ϫ73 mV) positive DC currents of 100 –200 and 150 pA
were injected to native TC neurons and the model cell, respectively. Furthermore, the indicated depolarizing current was
removed in the model cell. 4) The last experimental condition
simulates the effect of reducing the indicated hyperpolarizing
current by 90%, whereas the indicated depolarizing current
was removed from the computer model and a positive current
of ϩ150 pA was injected. As shown in Fig. 7, only the
combined modulation of ITASK/Ih and IK-leak/Ih closely matched
the experimental data from rats. It is interesting to note that the
use of a linear IK-leak component was less effective in reproducing whole cell patch-clamp recordings (data not shown).
Taken together, these data show that the joined modulation
of ITASK and Ih is the most likely cellular action that account
for the pH effect seen in native TC neurons.

The main results of the present paper can be summarized as
follows. 1) All known pacemaker channels (HCN1– 4),
TASK1–3 channels, and at least five other members of the K2P
channel family (TREK1, TREK2, TRAAK, THIK1, THIK2)
are expressed in rat dLGN. 2) The dominant isoforms, HCN2
and TASK3, are coexpressed in TC neurons. 3) Current components carried by HCN and TASK channels contribute to the
pH-sensitive component elicited by hyperpolarizing ramp protocols in TC neurons. 4) Extracellular acidification leads to
depolarization of TC neurons the magnitude of which critically
depends on the availability of HCN and TASK channels.
Current-clamp recordings in rats, HCN2Ϫ/Ϫ mice, and computer modeling studies demonstrate that the counterbalancing

effects of HCN2 and TASK3/TASK1 channels play an important role in setting the resting membrane potential of TC
neurons. 5) Although modulation of TASK and/or HCN channels can effectively shift TC neurons between firing modes, the
overall characteristics of the two forms of activity are rather
unchanged.
pH-sensitive membrane currents in TC neurons
TASK1 and TASK3 channels, which are sensitive to
changes in extracellular pH (Duprat et al. 1997; Kim et al.
2000; Rajan et al. 2000), are expressed in TC neurons (Meuth
et al. 2003). Thus pH-sensitive currents evoked by hyperpolarizing voltage ramps revealed typical features of a current
carried by TASK channels. However, the reversal potential
deviated from that of a pure Kϩ current. Even more surprising,
in contrast to the inhibition of TASK channels by bupivacaine
and muscarine (Meuth et al. 2003), the closure of TASK
channels by external Hϩ ions did not result in a strong
depolarization of the membrane potential. Only after blocking
Ih, pH-sensitive ramp currents reversed at the expected Kϩ
reversal potential and extracellular acidification induced a
strong depolarization, thereby proving the contribution of both
HCN and TASK channels to the pH-sensitive component.
The counterbalancing modulation of TASK and HCN channels restricts the net effect of acidification on the resting
membrane potential. The experimental paradigm used to demonstrate this interaction included the use of DC current injection to achieve similar control values of the membrane potential (about Ϫ72 mV). This was done to exemplify the different
effects of acidification with (no shift in activity mode) and
without Ih (shift in activity mode), rather than to mimic a
sequence of events in the brain. The scenario of interacting
TASK and HCN channels is strengthened by the fact that VR
values of TASK1-deficient mice are significantly more depolarized compared with wild-type animals under control conditions and in the presence of ZD7288 (Meuth et al. 2006).
Based on results obtained from rat (Meuth et al. 2003;
Musset et al. 2006), TASK1-KO mice (Meuth et al. 2006), and
computer modeling (this study) it can be concluded that the
pH-sensitive component (acidification to pH 6.3) makes up
about 40% of ISO (at Ϫ28 mV). However, at extracellular pH
values exceeding the modulation range of TASK channels (i.e.,
pH Ͻ6.0) ISO is further reduced, indicating the presence of
additional pH-sensitive components. To assess whether other
ion currents may mediate the pH effect seen in the present
study, we used computer modeling. Not one combination,
including IKir or INaP, was able to account for the result
obtained from TC neurons. Nevertheless the contribution of
more components cannot be fully excluded because changes in
extracellular pH can modulate the activity of a variety of ion
channels and receptors (for review see Kaila and Ransom
1998). Furthermore, subtle differences between cellular properties may account for differences in the pH effect under
control conditions seen in rat (depolarization) and mice (hyperpolarization). This view is corroborated, for example, by the
finding that TASK3 is clearly the dominant subtype in rat but
TASK1 and TASK3 reveal roughly equal mRNA levels in
mouse dLGN (Meuth et al. 2006). Similar considerations may
apply to HCN channels that show functional expression of
J Neurophysiol • VOL

HCN1 in rat (Budde et al. 2005) but not in mouse TC neurons
(Franz et al. 2000).
Constituents of the resting membrane potential in
TC neurons
The resting membrane potentials of TC neurons in different
species and thalamic nuclei are reportedly in the range of Ϫ60
to Ϫ75 mV (McCormick and Pape 1990; Meuth et al. 2003;
Porcello et al. 2003; Williams et al. 1997; Zhan et al. 1999), the
evolution of which is ascribed to leak currents (IK-leak, INa-leak),
pacemaker currents (Ih), inwardly rectifying Kϩ currents
(IKIR), voltage-dependent currents active below threshold (IA,
IT), and any DC current experimentally injected to the cell (Iinj)
(Williams et al. 1997; Zhan et al. 1999). In agreement with this
assumption the standing outward current of TC neurons
(Meuth et al. 2003) is composed of Ih, IKir, ITASK, a persistent
Naϩ current, and voltage-denpendent Kϩ currents. The results
of the present study allow the assignment of most of the Ih
component to HCN2 channels.
The evidence to support the hypothesis that Ih is active at the
resting membrane potential of TC neurons under the present
recording conditions (Ϫ71 mV) is as follows. Ih is a slow
inward current activating at potentials negative to Ϫ55 mV
(see Fig. 2D), shows no inactivation (McCormick and Pape
1990), and has a calculated reversal potential of about Ϫ35 mV
(Budde et al. 1997). According to the approximation of a
Boltzmann distribution to the data points a fraction of 18% of
Ih is activated at Ϫ71 mV (see Fig. 2D), carrying an inward
current of Ϫ34 Ϯ 2 pA (n ϭ 28). Block of Ih shifted the resting
membrane potential of TC neurons by Ϫ8 mV, a value in close
agreement with previously reported hyperpolarization (Ϫ5 to
Ϫ9 mV) in a number of different neuronal cell types (Day et al.
2005; Doan and Kunze 1999; Lupica et al. 2001; Maccaferri
and McBain 1996).
Based on our results on rodent TC neurons (Meuth et al.
2003, 2006; Musset et al. 2006) and computer modeling (this
study) it can be assumed that the classical Kϩ leak current is
roughly equally composed of pH-sensitive current through
TASK3/TASK1 channels (ITASK) and other pH-insensitive
leak channels (IK-leak). Although quantitative PCR experiments, subtype-specific modulation, and gene knock out point
to a domination of TASK3 over TASK1, the IK-leak component
may be carried by current through other members of the K2P
family. This conclusion is corroborated by the following findings. 1) IK-leak revealing GHK rectification (Goldstein et al.
2001) is necessary to give closely matching modeling results.
2) THIK, TRAAK, and TREK channels are expressed in
dLGN, although a consignment to defined cell types is still
missing. The functional expression of TREK and TRAAK
(Patel and Lazdunski 2004) channels in TC neurons is in
agreement with the presence of a leak current inhibited by
cAMP and Ba2ϩ (Budde et al. 1997, 2005) and an ISO component enhanced by arachidonic acid (Meuth et al. 2006). 3)
Modeling of the pH effect gives very similar results when both
ITASK and IK-leak are assumed to be pH sensitive.
It is noticeable that HCN2Ϫ/Ϫ mice show no plastic compensation for the loss of HCN2 channels. It has been noted
before that, for example, cerebellar granule cells show a greater
degree of plasticity in comparison with TC neurons in response

to TASK-1 deletion (Meuth et al. 2006). The reason for this
difference is unknown.
Comparability between data obtained in vitro and in silico
The quantitative aspects of the complex relationship between current amplitudes in vitro, current amplitudes in the
computer model, and their effect on the resting membrane
potential depend on pharmacological tools, the large parameter
space of the computer model, and experimental variations.
Therefore it cannot be expected to achieve full match between
experimental recordings and computer simulations. Still the
following considerations reveal a reasonable degree of similarity between experiments and modeling. 1) Injection of small
depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current pulses (from resting
membrane potential) to the model cell under current-clamp
conditions resulted in 1- to 3-mV voltage deflections and
allowed the calculation of the input resistance under control
conditions (43 M⍀) and after the block of Ih (90 M⍀).
Multiplying the difference in input resistance (47 M⍀) by the
amplitude of Ih at the resting membrane potential of the model
cell under control conditions (Ϫ130 pA) results in a voltage
deflection of Ϫ6 mV. In whole cell recordings that typically
reveal higher membrane resistances (some hundred megaohms) smaller currents (some tens of picoamperes) are able to
induce similar voltage shifts. 2) Absolute current values of Ih
and ITASK (amplitude of the pH-sensitive current in ZD7288) at
Ϫ71 mV reveal very similar proportions in vitro (Ih ϭ 34 Ϯ 2
pA, n ϭ 28; ITASK ϭ 31 Ϯ 2 pA, n ϭ 25) and in the computer
model (Ih ϭ 131 pA; ITASK ϭ 137 pA). Thus voltage changes
induced by blocking/knocking out Ih in rats, mice, and the
computer model (VZD Ϫ VR ϭ Ϫ8 mV; VR/HCN2ϩ/ϩ Ϫ VR/
HCN2Ϫ/Ϫ ϭ Ϫ12 mV; V3 Ϫ V1 ϭ Ϫ10 mV; median ϭ Ϫ10
mV) are in a range that has been described in several neuronal
cell types (see above) and are comparable to the effects
induced by blocking ITASK (VR Ϫ VZD/pH6.3 ϭ 19 mV; VR/
HCN2ϩ/ϩ Ϫ VpH6.3/HCNϪ/Ϫ ϭ 11 mV; V1 Ϫ V4/DC ϭ 13 mV;
median ϭ 14 mV). 3) The relationship between amplitudes
measured in vitro (recording temperature Ϸ 21°C) and the
computer model (simulation temperature 35°C) is given by the
Q10 value. Many enzyme reactions have a Q10 value near 3, as
does the gating of many ion channels, including Ih (Hille
2001). Although values for absolute conductance of Ih seem to
be Ͻ3 (Pena et al. 2006), the Q10 for Ih current amplitude in
intracardiac neurons could be determined as 2.2 (Cuevas et al.
1997). Thus the amplitude of Ih at the resting membrane
potential at 35°C can be expected to be Ϫ34 pA ϫ 3.1 (Q⌬T for
a temperature difference of 14°C) ϭ Ϫ105 pA, which is close
to the Ϫ130 pA generated by the computer model. The temperature dependency of TASK channels is less clear because
some K2P channels reveal a sevenfold increase in current
amplitude for a 10°C increment in temperature (Maingret et al.
2000).
Functional implications
The dorsal thalamus has a key role in regulating the flow of
sensory information from the periphery to the primary sensory
cortical areas and participates in the generation of thalamocortical oscillations associated with different states of consciousness and the status of absence epilepsy (Steriade et al. 1997).
J Neurophysiol • VOL

TC neurons are depolarized by neurotransmitters of the ascending brain stem system, including noradrenalin, serotonin, and
acetylcholine (McCormick 1992). Whereas noradrenalin exerts
this effect by the convergent modulation of IK-leak (i.e., closure)
and Ih (i.e., depolarizing shift in activation), acetylcholine
depolarizes TC neurons by closing TASK and IKIR channels
(Meuth et al. 2003). This depolarization is responsible for the
transition of sleep-related rhythmic burst activity to tonic
activity associated with periods of wakefulness and REM
sleep.
The view that the counterbalancing actions of TASK and
HCN on the resting membrane potential constitute a more
general motive in the CNS is in agreement with the broad
expression of HCN (Monteggia et al. 2000) and TASK (Talley
et al. 2001) channels in the brain, the reciprocal modulation of
Ih and ITASK by serotonin and halothane on hypoglossal motoneurons (Sirois et al. 2002), and the analysis of dendritic
excitability in mouse frontal cortex pyramidal cells (Day et al.
2005).
Pathophysiological implications
Neuronal activity leads to transient extracellular alkalinization followed by a persistent extracellular acidification
(Chesler and Kaila 1992). In dLGN synchronous afferent
activation, tonic activity, and rhythmic burst discharges induce
extracellular and intracellular increases in Hϩ concentrations
(Meyer et al. 2000; Tong and Chesler 1999). The data presented here suggest that pH shifts induced by different forms of
activity in dLGN should have rather small effects on the
overall firing pattern and resting membrane potential. This is of
special interest for periods of generalized absence epilepsy,
where the highly synchronous burst pattern of large populations of TC neurons is not expected to be altered by pH
changes arising from rhythmic activity.
Periods of brain ischemia are characterized by a decrease in
extracellular pH to values as low as 6.0 (Siemkowicz and
Hansen 1981; Simon et al. 1985). CNS neurons reveal extremely different sensitivity to ischemic insults (Centonze et al.
2001). The reason for this differential vulnerability is still
largely unknown. Vulnerable neurons respond to ischemia with
prolonged and strong membrane depolarization and subsequent
cellular damage. Because of the joined modulation of TASK
and HCN described here, it can be assumed that TC neurons
show little depolarization in response to acidification during
ischemic insults and thus a selective nonvulnerability. It seems,
however, that other influences dominate the reaction of TC
neurons to acute hypoxia (Erdemli and Crunelli 1998, 2000;
Steinke et al. 1992; Szelies et al. 1991). Under these conditions
there is an enhanced release of monoamines and nitric oxide—
substances known to strongly activate Ih—in the thalamus.
Therefore acute hypoxia leads to membrane depolarization and
altered electrical properties of TC neurons and makes the
dLGN a part of a system-preferential, topographically organized brain injury after ischemia (Erdemli and Crunelli 1998,
2000; Steinke et al. 1992; Szelies et al. 1991).

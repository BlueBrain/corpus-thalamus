ABSTRACT
The y-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus
(nRt) are a major source of inhibitory innervation in dorsal thalamic nuclei. Individual nRt
neurons were intracellularly recorded and labelled in an in vitro rat thalamic slice preparation
to investigate their projection into ventrobasal thalamic nuclei (VB).Camera lucida reconstructions of 37 neurons indicated that nRt innervation ranges from a compact, focal projection to a
widespread, diffuse projection encompassing large areas of VB. The main axons of 65% of the
cells gave rise to intra-nRt collaterals prior to leaving the nucleus and, once within VB, ramified
into one of three branching patterns: cluster, intermediate, and diffuse. The cluster arborization encompassed a focal region averagmg approximately 25,000 pm2 and contained a high
density of axonal swellings, indicative of a topographic projection. The intermediate structure
extended across an area approximately fourfold greater and also contained numerous axonal
swellings. The diffuse arborization of nRt neurons covered a large region of VB and contained a
relatively low density of axonal swellings. Analysis of somatic size and shape revealed that
diffuse arborizations arose from significantly smaller, fusiform-shaped somata. Cytochrome
oxidase reactivity or parvalbumin immunoreactivity was used to delineate a discontinuous
staining pattern representing thalamic barreloids. The size of a cluster arborization closely
approximated that of a n individual barreloid. The heterogeneous arborizations from nRt
neurons may reflect a dynamic range of inhibitory influences of nRt on dorsal thalamic
activity.

The thalamic reticular nucleus (nRt) is composed of a
thin layer of y-aminobutyric acid (GABAbcontaining neurons and encompasses the anterior, lateral, and ventral
extent of the dorsal thalamus (Jones, 1985). Virtually all
thalamocortical (TC) and corticothalamic (CT) fibers pass
through nRt. Collaterals from these traversing fibers serve
as the primary synaptic input for nRt neurons (Ohara and
Lieberman, 1981; Jones, 1985), whereas the major output
of nRt is to underlying dorsal thalamic nuclei (Scheibel and
Scheibel, 1966; Minderhoud, 1971; Jones, 1975). Consequently, excitation of nRt neurons by CT fibers provides
feedforward inhibition of neurons in relay nuclei, whereas
excitatory input from TC axons evokes feedback inhibition
onto TC neurons. Functionally, this intimate relationship
between nRt and dorsal thalamus can modify the flow of
information from thalamus to cortex and can play a role in
shaping receptive fields of dorsal thalamic neurons (Yingling and Skinner, 1976; Hale et al., 1982; Ahlsen et al.,
1985; Shosaku et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1994).In addition, the
reciprocal synaptic connectivity between nRt and dorsal
(

thalamic nuclei can generate oscillatory neuronal rhythms
(Steriade et al., 1993; von Krosigk et al., 1993; Huguenard
and Prince, 1994b), whose occurrence has been associated
with periods of decreased arousal and pathophysiologcal
conditions, such as generalized absence epilepsy (Williams,
1953; Domich et al., 1986; Steriade and Llinas, 1988).
Clearly, the primary output of nRt is in dorsal thalamus;
however, the topographical extent of this innervation is
uncertain. Studies using extracellular tracer injections
have demonstrated both a focal as well as a nonspecific
diffuse relationship between nRt and dorsal thalamus
(Jones, 1975; Montero et al., 1977; Crabtree and Killackey,
1989; Conley and Diamond, 1990; Crabtree, 1992; Liu
et al., 1995). Few studies have examined directly the
efferents of individual nRt neurons in dorsal thalamus to

AXONAL ARBORIZATIONS OF RAT THALAMIC RETICULAR NEURONS
resolve this inconsistency. Early Golgi studies revealed that
axonal projections from individual nRt neurons give rise to
a divergent axonal arborization that encompasses a relatively broad area of the target thalamic relay nucleus
(Scheibel and Scheibel, 1966). Intracellular labelling of
individual nRt neurons with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
clearly defined a diffuse axonal projection of individual nRt
neurons in ventrobasal thalamic nuclei (VB) and also
demonstrated that a single nRt neuron can innervate
multiple thalamic nuclei (Yen et al., 1985). These results
suggest that nRt-thalamic projections lack the precise
topographical organization characteristic of thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections. In contrast to these
findings, intracellular injections of single cells within the
perigeniculate nucleus, which is a structure analogous to
nRt in the visual dorsal thalamus, reveal that individual
neurons have both a focal and a diffuse axonal arborization
(Uhlrich et al., 1991). Furthermore, extracellular labelling
of single nRt neurons indicates a focal axonal projection
within somatosensory dorsal thalamus (Pinault et al.,
1995a).
The influence of nRt on thalamocortical function will be
affected significantly by the spatial extent of axonal projections from individual nRt neurons in the dorsal thalamus.
Because virtually all of its cells are GABA containing
(Houser et al., 19801, nRt serves as a major inhibitory
influence on thalamocortical neurons. Furthermore, because rodent dorsal thalamus, with the exception of the
lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN; Ottersen and StormMathisen, 19841, lacks inhibitory interneurons, nRt functions as its primary source of inhibition. Divergent nRt
projections would support a widespread inhibitory influence of nRt in dorsal thalamus. However, certain activities
that rely on the reciprocal connectivity of nRt and dorsal
thalamus, such as intrathalamic rhythmic oscillations and
focal receptive fields, may require a more restricted topographic relationship.
In these experiments, we have examined the morphology
of axonal arborizations originating from individual nRt
neurons that project to VB. Tight-seal, whole-cell, patchclamp recordings were obtained simultaneously to investigate intrinsic neuronal properties and to label individual
nRt neurons. Our findings indicate that individual nRt
neurons give rise to a heterogeneous population of axonal
arborizations, ranging from a very restricted focal projection to a widespread, divergent one. The focal axonal
arborizations could serve as an anatomical correlate for a
precise topographical relationship between nRt and dorsal
thalamus. Although the axonal arborizations of individual
nRt neurons can vary significantly, the intrinsic properties
of these cells are quite similar. Some of these findings have
appeared in abstract form (Cox et al., 1994).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Young Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal age, 10-16 days)
were deeply anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (55
mgikg) and decapitated, and the brains were quickly removed and placed into chilled oxygenated slicing medium
(4°C). Thalamic slices (400-450 km) were cut in the
horizontal plane (Huguenard and Prince, 1994a) by using a
Vibratome (TPI, St. Louis, MO) and were transferred to a
holding chamber containing oxygenated physiological saline (31°C) for at least 2 hours prior to recording. The
slicing medium contained (in mM) 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2P04,

417

10.0 MgC12, 0.5 CaCl2, 26.0 NaHC03, 11.0 glucose, and
234.0 sucrose. The physiological saline contained (in mM)
126.0 NaCl, 2.5 KCI, 1.25 NaH2P04,2.0 MgC12, 2.0 CaC12,
26.0 NaHC03, and 10.0 glucose. Both solutions had a pH of
7.4 when gassed with 95% O2 and 5%, COZ. Following
incubation, the slices were transferred to a recording
chamber maintained at 35 1°C and were superfused with
physiological saline at a rate of 1.3 mliminute.
Whole-cell recordings were made by using the “blind”
patch technique (Blanton et al., 1989). Recording pipettes
were pulled from borosilicate capillary glass (1.5 mm O.D.;
Garner Glass Company) by using a two-stage vertical
pipette puller (PP-83; Narishige). The pipettes had a tip
resistance of 4 to 6 MO when they were filled with the
following solution (in mM): 117 K-gluconate, 13 KCl, 1.0
MgC12, 0.07 CaC12, 0.1 ethylene glycol-O,O’-bis(2-aminoethyl)-N,N,N’,N‘-tetraacetic
acid (EGTA), 10.0 N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N’-(2-ethanesulfonic
acid; HEPES),
2.0 Na2-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, and biocytin (0.5%), pH 7.3.
Following formation of a high-resistance seal (1-4 GfZ), a
brief negative-pressure pulse was applied to the recording
pipette, and a whole-cell recording configuration was obtained with an initial access resistance ranging from 15 to
50 M a .
Current clamp recordings were obtained by using an
Axoclamp 2A amplifier (Axon Instruments) in the bridge
mode. Data were collected on line using computer-based
data acquisition software (Pclamp; Axon Instruments) and
were recorded on a chart recorder and on magnetic tape
(Neurodata) for later analysis. The apparent input resistance (RN) was determined from the linear slope of the
voltagelcurrent relationship obtained by applying constant
current pulses ranging from - 110 to 40 PA. Membrane
time constant ( T ~was
) estimated by fittinga single exponential decay function to the membrane response evoked by a
small hyperpolarizing current pulse (20 or 50 PA).
Following the recordings, slices were fixed in either 4%
paraformaldehyde or 4 8 paraformaldehyde/0.3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) overnight.
The procedures that were used for processing the biocytinfilled neurons were similar to those previously described
(Horikawa and Armstrong, 1988; Tseng et al., 1991).
Briefly, following fixation, the slices were resectioned a t 80
km, treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 and 2% bovine serum
albumin in 0.1 M PBS, and then incubated in an avidinbiotin-HRP complex (ABC kit PK-4000; Vector Laboratories). Following the diaminobenzidine reaction, osmium
tetroxide (1.0%:)in Tris buffer (0.1M) was used to intensify
the reaction product. The sections were then mounted, air
dried, and counterstained with cresyl violet to identify the
boundaries of VB and nRt. All compounds used were
purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise noted.
For histochemical experiments, male Sprague-Dawley
rats (postnatal age, 10-13 days; n = 7) were anesthetized as
before and were transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS. The brains
were removed and postfixed in the paraformaldehyde solution for an additional 2-24 hours. The tissue was then
sectioned at 50 km using a Vibratome or a freezing-stage
microtome. When using the latter method, the tissue was
cryoprotected with 25% sucrose-containing PBS prior to
sectioning. The procedures used for cytochrome-oxidase
staining were similar to those described by Wong-Riley
(1979). For the immunohistochemistry, antiparvalbumin

(anti-PV)antibody was obtained from Sigma. The sections
were washed iil 0.1 M PBS and were then incubated with
the anti-PV ( 1:1,000), 10% normal horse serum, and 0.3%
Triton X-100 for 17 hours. The sections were then incubated in the secondary antibody, anti-mouse immunoglobulin (I&; 1 : l O O ) in 0.1 M PBS, and were tagged with either
HRP or Texas red.

were reconstructed using a water-immersion, Hoffmanmodified x50 objective. For nRt neurons that were included in the analysis of bouton size and density, reconstructions were made using the x50 water-immersion or
the x 100 oil-immersion objective. Drawings were then
further enlarged on a photocopier (156% for x 100 drawings; 243% for x50 drawings) to improve the reliability of
the measurements. The lengths and areas of somata and
axonal arborizations and perimeters of axonal swellings
(boutons) were measured by using Sigmascan digitization
software (JandelScientific).The areas of dendritic arborizations of VB neurons were also measured from these drawings. In three neurons, bouton perimeters were measured
twice to verify the consistency of the observations. Bouton
densities were determined by counting the number of
boutons in a series of 30 x 30 pm grids extending across
the entire arborization. Statistical analyses consisted
primarily of either Student’s t test or a n analysis of
variance. Differences between the distributions of bouton
perimeters were tested by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test (K-S test; Press et al., 1986) and were considered
significant when P < 0.05. All averages are presented as
mean 5 standard error of the mean, unless otherwise
noted.

RESULTS
Axonal arborizations of nRt neurons
Thirty-seven intracellularly labelled nRt neurons with
extensive axonal arborizations in VB were included in the
present study. These neurons had stable resting potentials
and overshooting action potentials indicative of satisfactory
somatic recordings. The somata and dendrites of the labelled neurons were completely contained within the boundaries of nRt. The main axon of the nRt neuron originated
normally from either the soma or a proximal dendrite.
Sixteen of twenty-five neurons in which the main axon was
clearly distinguishable within the dendritic field gave rise to
intra-nRt collaterals that were typically short ( < 100 pm)
with few branches and never projected beyond the lateral
extent of the dendrites (see Fig. 5Dii). The occurrence of
these collaterals was not associated with any one of the
particular types of axonal arborization described below.
The main axon then projected toward VB either as a single
axon (see, e.g., Figs. lA, 3) or after dividing into multiple
branches (see, e.g., Figs. lB, 2). When the axon approached
its target in VB, it ramified into one of three different
arborization patterns, which we will term cluster, intermediate, and diffuse. Although the ventrobasal complex consists of two primary subdivisions, the ventroposteromedial
(VPM) and the ventroposterolateral (VPL) nuclei (for review, see Jones, 1985), the different arborization patterns

were observed throughout VB and did not appear to be
restricted to either one of these specific subdivisions.

Cluster axonal arborizations
A striking characteristic of the cluster arborization is the
restricted area that this structure encompasses. Representative cluster arborizations are illustrated in Figure 1. This
compact structure could arise from either a single- (Fig. 1A)
or a multiple-branched main axon (Fig. 1B). Closer examination of the cluster arborization revealed that it had a
large number of short axonal branches originating from the
main axon (Fig. 4A). These branches contained numerous
swellings (Fig. 4Aii),giving this axonal structure an overall
appearance similar to clusters of grapes. When viewed in
two dimensions in the horizontal plane, the cluster structure encompassed an average area of 24,181 2 2,873 pm2
( n = 11; range, 14,312-44,104 pm”, with a major axis
(length) of 298 2 38 pm (range, 145-479 pm) and width
(perpendicular to that axis) of 120 % 11 pm (range, 77-172
pm). The restricted size of the cluster arborization provides
direct evidence for a focal projection of nRt neurons in
dorsal thalamus.
Next, we compared the sizes of the cluster arborizations
to the area of the dendritic fields of VB neurons. The
average two-dimensional dendritic field of 11 reconstructed
VB neurons in horizontal sections was 47,139 2 6,820 pm2
(range, 23,889-58,870 pm2).Thus, the average area of the
cluster arborization (24,181 pm2) is approximately 50% of
the dendritic area of a VB neuron, suggesting that the
cluster may be in contact with a relatively small number of
VB relay cells.

Intermediate axonal arborizations
At first glance, the intermediate arborization was similar
in appearance to the cluster. At its target in VB, the main
axon gave rise to a branching structure (Fig. 2) that had an
average length of 583 _C 55 pm (range, 355-953 p m ) and
width of 359 2 52 pm (range, 160-716 pm), dimensions
that were significantly greater than those of the cluster
arborization ( P < 0.01). These intermediate axonal arbors
encompassed an average area of 116,540 2 15,067 pm2 ( n =
11; range, 65,626-247,267 pm2), or about fourfold larger
than that of the cluster arborization. Closer examination
revealed that the intermediate arborization also had a
complex axonal branching pattern; however, the collaterals
off the main axon as well as the subsequent branches
appeared to be longer and less dense than those of the
cluster (Fig. 4Bi,ii). A relatively large number of axonal
swellings were present within the intermediate arborization (Fig. 4Bii).

Diffuse axonal arborizations
The diffuse axonal arborization resembled the ramification pattern that has been described previously (Scheibel
and Scheibel, 1966; Yen et al., 1985). The main axon gave
rise to multiple branches in VB, and each of these branches
ramified divergently (Fig. 3).An obvious difference between
the diffuse structure and the other two axon types was the
decreased complexity of axonal branching in the former.
Although the axonal branching pattern of the intermediate
and diffuse arborizations appeared to be somewhat similar
in the collapsed two-dimensional camera lucida reconstructions (c.f. Figs. 2, 31, in a given microscopic field, these two
populations were easily distinguishable. Comparable photo-

micrographs of relatively dense branching regions for each
axonal arborization type are shown in Figure 4. Both the
cluster structure and the intermediate structure contained
many branches at a given focal depth (Fig. 4Ai,Bi); however, very few branches were present in the diffuse structure (Fig. 4Ci). The cluster and intermediate structures
typically had relatively short interbranch lengths (Fig.
4A,B),whereas axonal branches in the diffuse arborizations
tended to be longer (Fig. 4C). In the majority of neurons,
the area of diffuse arborizations could not be quantified,
because, unlike the cluster or intermediate arborizations,
the structure was not completely contained within a single
400-450-pm-thick slice. A second obvious difference between the diffuse arborizations and the other arborization
types was the density of the axonal swellings or putative
boutons. The cluster arborization contained an abundance

of axonal swellings (Fig. 4Aii), whereas both the intermediate (Fig. 4Bii) and the diffuse structures (Fig. 4Cii) had far
fewer axonal swellings.

Soma types
Because some studies have suggested that nRt neurons
are a heterogeneous population distinguishable by somatic
and dendritic characteristics (Spreafico et al., 1988, 1991),
we examined filled cells to determine whether different
axonal arborizations were associated with different types of
somata. In general, the soma shapes could be divided into
two primary types: fusiform and round (Fig. 5). Typically,
the major axis of the fusiform-shaped somata was oriented
parallel to the border of nRt and VB, and the primary
dendrites emerged from the poles of the soma, extending in

the same plane as the soma (Fig. 5A,B). The primary
dendrites gave rise to multiple secondary dendrites that
branched farther, usually ending with distal axon-like
dendrites (see, e.g., Fig. SCii, arrows). The primary dendrites of round somata could emerge from any side of the

soma (Fig. 5Ci,Di)and were similar to those of the fusiformshaped cells, in that the dendrites had multiple branches
that typically ended in axon-like appendages (Fig. 5Cii).
The intermediate or cluster axonal arborizations were each
associated with fusiform-shaped somata in approximately

By contrast, 12 of 14 diffuse arborizations (85%) were
associated with fusiform somata.
Variations in somatic size were observed among nRt cells
with different axona1 arborizations (Table 1). Although
there was no significant difference in the somatic areas of
neurons with cluster (467.9 34.1 pm2) vs. intermediate
arborizations (509.9 ? 50.1 pm2; P > O . l ) , somata of cells

with diffuse arborizations were significantly smaller than
either of the other types (343.9 & 25.1 pm2; P < 0.05).
Whereas somatic lengths (major axis) were not significantly
different between neurons with the three types of axonal
arbors ( P > 0.1), the width (minor axis) of neurons
associated with diffuse arborizations was significantly less
than that of cells with cluster- or intermediate-type arbors
( P < 0.05).

The distributions of bouton perimeters for each arbor
type were skewed towards larger values (Fig. 6A). The
histogram of normalized bouton counts in Figure 6A illustrates that the predominant peak perimeter of the cluster
boutons was smaller than that of the diffuse and intermediate axonal boutons. Furthermore, the latter two distributions appeared to be quite similar. Cumulative probability
plots indicated that the bouton perimeters associated with
the cluster arborization were significantly different than
those of the intermediate or diffuse types (Fig. 6A, inset;
K-S test; P < 0.01). Although the cumulative probability
plots of bouton perimeters for intermediate and diffuse
populations appeared to be quite similar, they were also
significantly different (K-S
test; P < 0.01). From our initial
microscopic observations, it appeared that the boutons in
the cluster were predominantly small and somewhat uniform in appearance, whereas those in the intermediate and
diffuse arborizations were variable in size, with both small
and larger sized boutons. To further evaluate this observation, we fitted multiple Gaussian distributions to best
approximate the total population of bouton perimeters. The
distributions of bouton perimeters for individual neurons
and the total population for each type of arborization were
all best fitted by the sum of two Gaussian distributions (Fig.
6B). For all three types of arborizations, the primary
Gaussian distribution accounted for approximately 80% of
the bouton population, whereas the secondary distribution
encompassed the remaining 20% (Fig. 6B). Although each
arbor type apparently contained two normally distributed
subpopulations of boutons, the means of each subpopulation for the clusters (small, 3.0 pm; large, 4.8 Fm) were
smaller than the corresponding values for intermediate or
(small, 4.0 pm; large, 6.2 p m ) or diffuse (small, 3.8 Fm;
large, 5.6 pm) types. Intermediate and diffuse arborizations
tended to have higher proportions of larger boutons. For
example, the percentages of boutons with perimeters greater
than 6 km in the intermediate (14.65%)and the diffuse
( 12.8‘;1 J arborizations were more than double the percentage present within the cluster arborizations (5.3%).
Differences in the density of axonal swellings were revealed when similar sized microscopic fields of the different
arborizations were compared (Fig. 4Aii,Bii,Cii). The density
of axonal swellings was correlated with the type of arborization. The cluster arborization had the highest average
density of swellings (20.6 c 1.7 boutonsi900 )*my),those of
the intermediate type were less dense (15.7 c 0.8 boutonsl
900 krn”), and those of diffuse arborizations had the lowest
average density (8.7 2 0.5 boutonsi900 pm”. The contour
plots of bouton density in Figure 7A-C correspond to the
camera lucida drawings in Figures lA, 2, and 3 , respectively, and clearly illustrate both the differences in bouton
density and in area distribution for the three different
arborizations. The cluster arborization contained a high
density of boutons in a small core area (Fig. 7A). By
contrast, the intermediate arborization encompassed a
much larger area and had multiple regions of moderate
bouton density (Fig. 7B); however, the peak bouton densities were only approximately 50% of the cluster (cf. Fig.

ANOVA Sullowrd hy ‘I‘ukry-Kramcr multiplt,nimparist,nI

7A,B). The diffuse arborization (Fig. 7C) had a significantly
lower overall bouton density without the centralized regions of higher density that characterized the intermediate
and cluster arborizations.

Cytochrome-oxidase and P V reactivity
To gain perspective on the relationship of nRt projection
patterns in VB to features of the intrinsic anatomical
organization of the nucleus, we examined the “barreloids”
located within VPM known to be receptive areas for sensory
input from single vibrissae on the snout (Van der Loos,
1976; Land and Simons, 1985). We hypothesized that the
tightly clustered type of nRt axonal termination might
relate spatially to these somatotopic structures. Two approaches were used to stain the barreloids. Cytochromeoxidase staining in rodents is known to reveal the barreloids
as patchy regions of increased metabolic activity in VPM
(Van der Loos, 1976; Land and Simons, 1985).The visibility
of this barreloid pattern has been shown to be heavily
dependent on the plane of section (Land and Simons, 1985).
When we obtained cytochrome oxidase-stained sections, we
observed a clearly defined pattern within VPM similar to
what has been previously described (Fig. 8A).
A second approach to defining the barreloids involved
staining with an antibody to PV. Virtually all neurons
within nRt contain GABA and are PV immunoreactive
(Houser et al., 1980; Seto-Ohsima et al., 1989; Celio, 1990).
Results of PV staining in a horizontal thalamic slice are
shown in Figure 8. We found that the majority of somata in
nRt were PV immunoreactive (Fig. 8B). By contrast, no
somata in VB were PV immunoreactive; however, PV‘
fibers traveling in the presumed path of nRt-VB projections
were obvious in VB at higher magnifications (not shown).
Furthermore, in the same horizontal sections, the PV+
fibers in VPM formed a barreloid-like pattern that was
similar to that revealed with cytochrome-oxidase staining
(cf. Fig. 8A,B). With higher magnification, individual barreloids were quite obvious (Fig. 8Ci). When single cluster
arborizations of nRt neurons were superimposed on representative barreloids, it became obvious that the size and
shape of the cluster arborizations roughly approximated
those of individual barreloids (Fig. 8Cii). The relatively
high density of boutons found in the cluster arborizations
may contribute to the nonuniform PV’ fiber staining
observed within VPM. It also appeared that the various
orientations of the cluster axonal arborizations were remarkably consistent with the multiple orientations of the barreloids in horizontal sections (see, e.g., Fig. 8Cii).

within thalamic relay nuclei are heterogeneous. Individual
nRt neurons can give rise to one of three axonal arborizations: cluster, intermediate, or diffuse. These arborization
patterns are present throughout VB and are not limited to a
specific subdivision of VB. The presence of cluster arborizations provides a clear demonstration that nRt neurons can
have very focal projections within dorsal thalamic nuclei. In
VB, these arborizations are characterized by their compact
area, the complexity of axonal ramifications, and the relatively high density of small axonal swellings. Each cluster
arborization has a two-dimensional area that overlaps with
approximately 50% of the dendritic area of a single VB
neuron, indicating little divergence of this projection (certainly far less than that for diffuse or intermediate arbors).
The intermediate specialization covers a larger area of VB
and contains one or more regions of high bouton density.

DISCUSSION
The thalamic reticular nucleus serves as a major inhibitory input to thalamic relay nuclei. Thus, the projection of
nRt neurons upon relay neurons will have profound influences on thalamocortical activity. This study provides clear
evidence that the anatomic projections of nRt neurons

different types of structures. Bouton density was quantified using a 30 x 30 Fm grid. The plots of cluster,
intermediate, and diffuse houton density represent the cells illustrated in Figures lA, 2, and 3, respectively.

The diffuse specialization consists of more divergent axonal
branching and a relatively uniform bouton density across
the entire arborization.
Elegant Golgi studies by Scheibel and Scheibel (1966)
have revealed that single nRt neurons could innervate
multiple thalamic nuclei in rodents. The axonal branching
pattern in the dorsal thalamus was described as divergent
and simple, suggesting that an individual nRt axon could
project to a relatively large portion of the nucleus and could
potentially make contact with a large number of neurons.
Yen et al. (1985) examined the projections of individual
physiologically identified somatosensory nRt neurons in VB
by using intracellular injections of HRP. Their data indicated that nRt neurons in cats could project to multiple
thalamic nuclei and that the axonal ramifications of single
nRt neurons in VB were diffuse and encompassed a relatively large area of the nucleus, further supporting the
general hypothesis of a diffuse projection of nRt neurons
within thalamic relay nuclei. Our findings also support the
presence of a diffuse projection in VB, but only in one-third
of labelled rat nRt neurons. The remaining two-thirds of
the nRt neurons have more localized projections that were

not described in these earlier studies, suggesting multiple
types of nRt projections in relay thalamus.
Other studies have suggested a more precise topographical relationship between nRt and dorsal thalamus (Montero
et al., 1977; Hale et al., 1982; Crabtree and Killackey, 1989;
Liu et al., 1995). The cluster arborization, with its clear
focal projection, could serve as the anatomical substrate for
a topographic relation between nRt and dorsal thalamus.
The confined size and complexity of the cluster is strikingly
similar to the lemniscal inputs in VB (see, e.g., Yen and
Jones, 1983).Because we have labelled the connecting soma
and made physiological recordings that are consistent with
somatic electrode sites, our data clearly indicate that the
cluster arborizations originate from nRt neurons. Results
of a recent study using extracellular biocytin to label
individual rat nRt neurons suggest that all projections
within VB from nRt are focal (Pinault et al., 1995a). Our
results differ, in that we observed these focal cluster
arborizations in only about one-third of the labelled neurons. The different results obtained in the experiments of
Yen et al. (1985), Pinault et al. (1995a1, and the present
study may be a consequence of the different labelling

techniques andlor the intracellular tracers used. Alternatively, these dissimilar results may be due to a developmental process. Because diffuse and cluster axonal arborizations have been observed in young rodents (Scheibel and
Scheibel, 1966; present study) and because only cluster-like
arborizations have been observed in adult rodents (Pinault
et al., 1995a1, the diffuse arborizations may be the immature predecessor of the cluster axonal arborizations. Although this hypothesis remains to be tested directly in
rodents, intracellular injections of individual nRt neurons
have revealed the presence of diffuse axonal arborizations
in adult cats (Yen et al., 1985).
Some investigators have hypothesized that nRt neurons
can be categorized into different types based on soma shape
and dendritic morphology (Spreafico et al., 1988, 1991). We
have attempted to determine whether different axonal
arborization types may be associated with different soma
shape and size. Eighty-five percent of neurons with diffuse
axonal arborizations had fusiform-shaped somata. On the
other hand, both cluster and intermediate axonal arborizations were equally associated with either fusiform or round
soma shapes. In addition, somata associated with the
diffuse arborization were significantly smaller than those
with the intermediate or cluster specializations. Spreafico
et al. (1991) suggest that there are three populations of
neurons within nRt, consisting of large fusiform (F),round
( R ) ,and small fusiform ( 0 ,that are distinguishable not only
by general somatic morphology and location but also by
dendritic orientation. Lubke (1993) also reported multiple
shapes and sizes of nRt neurons but could not distinguish
among the different soma types based on cell localization
and dendritic orientation. On the basis of the size and shape
of somata, the cluster and intermediate arbors may belong
to F and R types of neurons, whereas the f-type neurons
may have diffuse arbors; however, apparent differences in
dendritic orientation or locale within nRt were not apparent in our data.
An obvious distinguishing characteristic among the different axonal arborizations was bouton density. The cluster
arborization had a relatively high bouton density, whereas
the boutons of the intermediate specialization were less
dense and encompassed a n area two to four times larger
than boutons of the cluster specialization. The boutons of
the diffuse specialization were uniformly distributed and
low in density. If the density of the axonal swellings is
indicative of the concentration of possible release sites, then
these findings would suggest a potentially strong inhibitory
influence in VB by a single cluster. The use of electron
microscopy to assess the density of synaptic connections of
individual nRt neurons within VB will be necessary to
address this issue.
A number of physiological characteristics were compared
among the neurons associated with these different arborizations. If the subtypes of arborizations are derived from

different populations of nRt neurons, then it would seem
reasonable to suggest that these cells may have different
physiological properties (Friedlander et al., 1981; Contreras
et al., 1992; Huguenard and Prince, 1992). Differences
might include the neurotransmitterineuropeptide phenotype, fine details of their synapses in the dorsal thalamus,
or the nature and density of postsynaptic receptors. We did
examine a number of intrinsic membrane characteristics,
including resting membrane potential, membrane time
constant, and action potential parameters (Table 2); however, these did not differ significantly between the arborization types. The smaller “diffuse” cells, as might be expected, had a significantly higher input resistance than the
intermediate or cluster types. Although this difference
could be reflected in an increased responsiveness to afferent
synaptic activity, preliminary observations of synaptic potentials in response to electrical stimulation of internal
capsule have not revealed any obvious qualitative differences among the different axonal groups (Cox, Huguenard,
and Prince, unpublished observations).

Functional role of multiple
axonal arborizations
Thalamic neurons generate action potentials in “burst”
and “single spike” firing modes. These discharge patterns
vary with the level of behavioral arousal and can influence
the passage of sensory information from the periphery
through the thalamus to the cortex (Steriade and Llinas,
1988; Steriade et al., 1993). The firing mode and the
transition between modes is due in part to voltagedependent intrinsic properties of thalamic neurons (Desch&neset al., 1982; Jahnsen and Llinas, 1984; Coulter et
al., 1989; Steriade et al., 1993; Huguenard and Prince,
1994a). The reciprocal synaptic connectivity between nRt
and dorsal thalamus gives rise to an intrathalamic circuit
that is capable of generating rhythmic oscillatory activities.
When these thalamic neurons are in burst mode, the
oscillatory activities are similar to sleep spindles and to the
spike and wave activity that is characteristic of absence
epilepsy (Steriade and Llinas, 1988; Steriade et al., 1993;
von Krosigk et al., 1993; Huguenard and Prince, 1994a).
The potency of nRt GABAergic output, which hyperpolarizes relay neurons by activating both GABA, and GABAI~
receptors (Hirsch and Burnod, 1987; Crunelli et al., 1988;
Huguenard and Prince, 1994a1, is a critical factor in
regulating the firing mode of relay neurons. In this context,
the topography and density of VB innervation by the three
different arborization types may have important functional
implications. For example, relatively few nRt neurons of
the cluster and/or intermediate arborization types, with
their relatively high bouton density, may form the anatomical substrate that produces a sufficient hyperpolarization to
induce bursts of spike discharge in VB neurons. Burst

T-type Ca2+ channels in thalamocortical (TC) neurons have long
been considered to play a critical role in the genesis of sleep spindles, one of several TC oscillations. A classical model for TC oscillations states that reciprocal interaction between synaptically
connected GABAergic thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) neurons
and glutamatergic TC neurons generates oscillations through Ttype channel-mediated low-threshold burst ﬁrings of neurons in
the two nuclei. These oscillations are then transmitted from TC
neurons to cortical neurons, contributing to the network of TC
oscillations. Unexpectedly, however, we found that both WT and
KO mice for CaV3.1, the gene for T-type Ca2+ channels in TC neurons, exhibit typical waxing-and-waning sleep spindle waves at
a similar occurrence and with similar amplitudes and episode durations during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Single-unit recording
in parallel with electroencephalography in vivo conﬁrmed a complete lack of burst ﬁring in the mutant TC neurons. Of particular
interest, the tonic spike frequency in TC neurons was signiﬁcantly
increased during spindle periods compared with nonspindle periods in both genotypes. In contrast, no signiﬁcant change in burst
ﬁring frequency between spindle and nonspindle periods was
noted in the WT mice. Furthermore, spindle-like oscillations were
readily generated within intrathalamic circuits composed solely of
TRN and TC neurons in vitro in both the KO mutant and WT mice.
Our ﬁndings call into question the essential role of low-threshold
burst ﬁrings in TC neurons and suggest that tonic ﬁring is important for the generation and propagation of spindle oscillations in
the TC circuit.

channels in TC neurons have been proposed to be a critical
component in the generation of physiological and pathological
TC oscillations, such as sleep rhythms (1, 11, 12) and the spikewave discharges (SWDs) of absence seizures (11, 13, 14). One
generally accepted hypothesis proposes that inhibitory inputs
from TRN neurons de-inactivate T-type Ca2+ channels in TC
neurons, leading to induction of burst ﬁrings in TC neurons, which
in return excite reciprocally connected TRN neurons. These thalamic oscillations are then transmitted from TC neurons to cortical neurons. This model proposes that T-type channel-mediated
burst ﬁring in TC neurons underlies sleep spindles and other sleep
rhythms within TC circuits (1, 11).
There have long been doubts regarding the extent to which TC
T-type Ca2+ channels contribute to the heterogeneity of TC
oscillations during NREM sleep, which consists of multiple EEG
components including slow waves (<1 Hz), delta waves (1–4 Hz),
and sleep spindles (7–14 Hz). T-type channels have received
particular attention in the genesis of spindles and delta waves,
both of which are thought to originate from thalamic neurons
(8), although cortically generated delta waves also have been
found in cats with thalamic lesions (15). A role for TC T-type
channels in sleep has been demonstrated in two studies, one
using mice with a global deletion (16) and the other using mice
with a thalamus-restricted deletion (17) of CaV3.1 T-type channels. Both mice exhibited reduced delta waves with intact slow
waves (16, 17). Fragmented sleep was observed in both mice,
indicating that this sleep phenotype in the global CaV3.1−/− mice

leep spindles are one type of several rhythmic brain waves
detected by electroencephalography (EEG) during normal
non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. A spindle consists of
characteristic waxing-and-waning ﬁeld potentials grouped into 7to 14-Hz oscillations that last for 1–3 s and recur once every 5–10
s in the thalamus and the cortex (1–3). Spindles are also visible
under anesthesia, particularly with barbiturates but also with
ketamine-xylazine combinations (4, 5). These oscillations are
generated in the thalamus as a result of synaptic interactions
between inhibitory [i.e., thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN)] neurons and excitatory thalamocortical (TC) neurons, and are
propagated to the cortex. Corticothalamic projections back to
the thalamus complete the cortico-thalamo-cortical loop.
In vivo data suggest that TRN neurons are spindle pacemakers, because spindles can be generated in deafferented TRN
neurons (6) but disappear in TC regions after disconnection
from TRN neurons (7). However, in vitro data suggest that an
intact TC-TRN network is a necessity, because spindles are
abolished after disconnection of TC and TRN neurons (8).
Two distinct ﬁring patterns, tonic and burst, are displayed by
both TRN and TC neurons. Burst ﬁring is mediated by lowthreshold T-type Ca2+ channels (9). Of the three subtypes of T-type
channels, CaV3.1 is expressed exclusively in TC regions, whereas
CaV3.2 and CaV3.3 are abundant in TRN regions (10). T-type

Signiﬁcance
This study addresses one of the most fundamental issues in
sleep rhythm generation. The theory that low-threshold burst
ﬁring mediated by T-type calcium channels in thalamocortical
neurons is the key component for sleep spindles, has been
accepted as dogma and appears throughout the literature. In
this study, however, in vivo and in vitro evidence shows that
sleep spindles are generated normally in the absence of T-type
channels and burst ﬁring in thalamocortical neurons. Furthermore, our data indicate a potentially important role of tonic
ﬁring in this rhythm generation. This study advances the
knowledge of sleep and vigilance control to another level
of understanding.

(Fig. 1B). These ﬁndings appear to indicate that sleep spindles
are not altered in CaV3.1−/− mice.
Decreased Duration of Barbiturate-Induced Spindle Episodes in
Cav3.1−/− Mice. We next examined the characteristics of spindle

oscillations induced by barbiturate injection. In agreement with
the literature (20), we found that barbiturate-induced spindles
were characterized by large-amplitude oscillations of increased
duration compared with sleep spindles (Fig. 2A). The mean
duration of barbiturate-induced spindle episodes was almost
doubled compared with the spindle episode duration during
NREM sleep in the CaV3.1+/+ mice, but not in the CaV3.1−/−
mice. Compared with the CaV3.1+/+ mice, the CaV3.1−/− mice
exhibited shorter barbiturate-induced spindle episodes (*P <
0.05; Fig. 2B), as well as smaller peak-to-peak amplitudes (*P <
0.05), whereas there was no difference in the peak frequency of
spindles between the two genotypes (Fig. 2B). Of note, the
spindle episodes in the CaV3.1−/− mice were composed of shorter
episodes compared with those seen in the WT mice (Fig. 2C).
Taken together, these results suggest that low-threshold spikes
(LTSs) mediated by CaV3.1 T-type Ca2+ channels in TC neurons
are not essential for spindle generation, but may play a role in increasing the duration of spindles episodes induced by barbiturates.

is related to a defect in TC neurons. The effect of the mutation
on spindle rhythms was unclear, however (16).
In the present study, we examined the role of low-threshold
burst ﬁring in sleep spindles expressed in TC neurons using mice
lacking CaV3.1 T-type Ca2+ channels. We observed intact sleep
spindles in CaV3.1−/− mice during NREM sleep. Our ﬁndings
suggest that the classical view of the roles of T-type channels and
burst ﬁring in TC neurons with respect to the generation of
spindle oscillations may need to be revised.
Results
Sleep Spindles Are Not Altered in Cav3.1−/− Mice During Natural
NREM Sleep. First, in an attempt to elucidate the role of low-

threshold burst ﬁring mediated by TC T-type channels in generating sleep spindles, we examined EEGs recorded during
a state of natural sleep in mice lacking the CaV3.1 T-type
channels that are highly expressed in TC neurons. EEG/electromyography (EMG) recordings were acquired with a telemetry
system over a continuous period of 48 h in mice housed in their
home cages. These data were analyzed to assign the sleep categories of awake, NREM, and rapid eye movement (REM) states
based on standard criteria for the analysis of rodent sleep (18).
The sleep spindle episodes in both CaV3.1+/+ and CaV3.1−/−
mice exhibited a characteristic waxing-and-waning pattern and
typical recurring sequences (Fig. 1A) that met the stereotypical
criteria for sleep spindles (1, 8, 19). There were no signiﬁcant
differences in the number of spindle episodes, mean duration of
episodes, peak-to-peak amplitudes, or peak frequencies of
spindle oscillations between the CaV3.1+/+ and CaV3.1−/− mice

induced spindles in CaV3.1−/− mice prompted us to investigate
the properties of TC neuron spike discharges during spindle
episodes in the absence of low-threshold burst ﬁring. To do this,
we performed in vivo extracellular single-unit recordings in TC
neurons while simultaneously monitoring the cortical EEG under barbiturate anesthesia.
Both tonic and burst spikes were observed in CaV3.1+/+ TC
cells, whereas only tonic spikes were detected in CaV3.1−/− TC
cells (Fig. 3 A–C), conﬁrming previous in vitro data (13). Bursts
were identiﬁed according to the conventional criteria (21), with
a burst deﬁned as a cluster of two or more spikes with interspike
intervals of ≤4 ms, in which the ﬁrst spike in the burst has
a preceding interspike interval of >100 ms (Fig. S1). Spikes
recorded over 15 consecutive spindle sequences (SP1–SP15)
were aligned with the initiation time of each cortical EEG
spindle event. The perievent histograms showed a large number
of TC spikes co-occurring within cortical spindle events (Fig.
3B), as reported previously (22, 23). Of note, we found the spike
frequency was signiﬁcantly higher during spindle periods compared with nonspindle periods in both WT mice (1.71 ± 0.23 Hz
vs. 0.73 ± 0.16 Hz) and KO mice (1.94 ± 0.43 Hz vs. 0.18 ± 0.04
Hz) (Fig. 3C, a). Of particular importance, there was no difference in the total spiking rate (across tonic and burst activity)
within spindle events between two genotype TC neurons (P =
0.42; Fig. 3C, a) with event correlation (Fig. S2), whereas the
nonspindle spike frequency was signiﬁcantly lower in CaV3.1−/−
neurons compared with CaV3.1+/+ neurons (Fig. 3C, a).
Further analysis of the ﬁring mode of TC neurons revealed
a signiﬁcantly higher tonic spike frequency in both WT and
mutant mice during spindle periods than during nonspindle
periods (Fig. 3C, b). During spindle episodes, the tonic spike
frequency was signiﬁcantly higher in mutant KO mice compared

with WT mice, perhaps explaining why the total spiking rate of
mutant TC neurons within cortical spindle events was as high as
that in WT neurons, even though the mutants are devoid of burst
spikes. In contrast, there was no signiﬁcant difference in burst
ﬁring between spindle and nonspindle periods (Fig. 3C, b), either
in the frequency of burst spikes (0.58 ± 0.15 Hz vs. 0.35 ± 0.09
Hz) or in the occurrence of burst events (0.28 ± 0.09 Hz vs. 0.16 ±
0.06 Hz; P = 0.27). In other words, the majority of CaV3.1+/+
TC cells discharged burst spikes without preference for spindle
episodes; just 2 of 13 ﬁred bursts preferentially during the
spindle period.
Also of interest is our ﬁnding of no difference in the overall
spike frequency of TC neurons during spindle events between
the two genotypes. Of note, WT TC neurons exhibited a higher
tonic spike frequency than burst spike frequency during spindle
events. More importantly, the tonic spike frequency in WT mice
was signiﬁcantly (∼3.5-fold) higher during spindle periods than
during nonspindle periods, whereas the burst spike frequency did
not differ in the two periods. The tonic spike frequency observed
in CaV3.1−/− TC cells coincided even more strongly with spindles
(∼10-fold higher). In addition, spike discharges recorded in both
CaV3.1+/+ and CaV3.1−/− TRN neurons were more frequent
during spindle episodes (Fig. S3), in parallel with the ﬁndings in
TC neurons.
Spindle-Like Oscillations Elicited in Intrathalamic Circuits in Cav3.1−/−
Mice. Our ﬁnding that robust generation of cortical spindles is

accompanied by increased TC spike discharges in CaV3.1−/− mice
prompted us to further investigate whether spindle oscillations
can be generated within an intrathalamic circuit composed only
of TRN and TC neurons in the presence or absence of LTSs in
TC neurons. For this purpose, we assessed thalamic network

activity in TC slices with and without attached cortex (24). Previous studies have demonstrated that oscillations within the
range observed for sleep spindles in vivo (22) can be evoked in
thalamic slices by electrical stimulation of the internal capsule
(IC) (25). These are thus referred to as “spindle-like oscillations”
(SLOs) (26). We adopted this paradigm using the multielectrode
array system as described in SI Materials and Methods.
Thalamic oscillations were evoked by a single 20- to 100-μV,
60- to 80-μs electrical stimulation in the IC in TC slices. Clusters
of spikes composed of multiple units with various amplitudes
were detected simultaneously in TRN and TC nuclei (Fig. 4A).
SLOs were readily generated in these thalamic slices from both
CaV3.1+/+ and CaV3.1−/− mice in the presence and absence of
cortex (Fig. 4A). There were no signiﬁcant differences in the
durations of evoked oscillatory activities between CaV3.1+/+ and
CaV3.1−/− thalamic slices with cortex (7 slices from 7 WT mice vs.
8 slices from 7 mutant mice) or without cortex (13 slices from 8
WT mice vs. 12 slice from 9 mutant mice) (Fig. 4B), although the
total TC spike numbers in CaV3.1−/− thalamic slices were lower
than those in CaV3.1+/+ slices in the absence of cortex (P = 0.047;
Fig. 4C).
The foregoing results provide direct evidence contrary to the
classical view that postinhibitory low-threshold burst ﬁring mediated by T-type Ca2+ channels in TC neurons is essential for the
generation of oscillations within the TRN-TC circuit. They suggest that instead, sleep spindles observed in CaV3.1−/− mice may
be generated within the TRN-TC circuit in the absence of
TC bursts.

Excitability of CaV3.1−/− TC Neurons in Vitro. Our next step was to

examine whether generation of spindle oscillations within the
CaV3.1−/− intrathalamic circuit might be related to changes in the
intrinsic excitability of TC neurons rather than to a loss of lowthreshold burst ﬁring by deletion of CaV3.1 T-type channels. To
do this, we used the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to measure the excitability of TC neurons. We found no differences
between CaV3.1+/+ (n = 12) and CaV3.1−/− (n = 14) TC neurons
in membrane capacitance (141.2 ± 15.6 pF vs. 137.4 ±10.5 pF),
resting membrane potential (−59.11 ± 5.34 mV vs. −57.54 ± 6.31
mV), or membrane resistance (219.5 ± 48.2 MΩ vs. 175.4 ±
38.2 MΩ).
We then measured hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel-mediated current (Ih) in TC neurons at the
tail current at 0.7 s after a test voltage pulse (Fig. 5A) to minimize the capacitative contribution (27) or non–Ih-active current
(28). We observed an increase in the current density of Ih in
CaV3.1−/− TC neurons compared with CaV3.1+/+ TC neurons
only when membrane potential was hyperpolarized to ≥−100
mV (Fig. 5 A and B). We then measured the ﬁring pattern of TC
neurons. Low-threshold burst ﬁring was ablated in CaV3.1−/− TC
neurons, whereas vigorous burst ﬁring was induced in CaV3.1+/+
TC neurons, with a membrane potential rebound to −60 mV
after hyperpolarization to −70 to −120 mV (Fig. 5 C and D).
Some CaV3.1−/− TC neurons (6 of 10) produced a single spike
when the membrane potential was returned to −60 mV after
hyperpolarization to ≥−100 mV (Fig. 5 C and D), possibly related to the enhanced Ih current (Fig. 5 A and B). However, the
enhanced Ih current did not affect either the tonic or burst ﬁring
rate elicited by depolarizing current injections (Fig. 5 C–E), and
did not alter any other intrinsic membrane properties of CaV3.1−/−
TC neurons. Thus, we conclude that deletion of CaV3.1 T-type
channel did not signiﬁcantly alter the intrinsic excitability of
TC neurons. The ﬁring pattern of TRN neurons was not
changed either (Fig. S4).

and CaV3.1−/− thalamic slices in either the presence or absence of the cortex.

CaV3.1 T-Type Channels in Sleep Rhythms. Sleep spindles have been
proposed to arise from the intrathalamic circuit composed of
TRN and TC neurons (8, 29). Postinhibitory LTSs in TC neurons
has been considered essential for the generation of intrathalamic
oscillations and their propagation to the cortex (1). According to
this hypothesis, spindle oscillations should be diminished, if not
abolished, in cortical EEGs of CaV3.1−/− mice lacking LTSs in
TC neurons.
In contrast to this expectation, we clearly observed sleep
spindle waves in cortical EEG recordings from both CaV3.1+/+
and CaV3.1−/− mice during NREM sleep. We chose a method
suitable for analyzing spindle waves in mice (19) used in previous
studies (1–3). In a previous study on the sleep phenotype of
CaV3.1−/− mice, we ﬁltered EEG data with a high-pass cutoff at
0.1 Hz to include and analyze all sleep rhythms. This did not
exclude the possibility that a signiﬁcant reduction in delta power
in CaV3.1−/− mice might exaggerate the difference in the EEG
power density of the spindle component (16). In the present
study, we used a 6- to 15-Hz bandpass ﬁlter to clearly reveal
spindle oscillations and exclude delta and slow waves (Figs. 1A
and 2A and Fig. S5), and found no difference in the number of
sleep spindle episodes between CaV3.1+/+ and CaV3.1−/− mice.
Neither the duration nor the amplitude of the spindle episodes
was reduced in CaV3.1−/− mice during natural NREM sleep,
raising questions about the essential role of TC neuron T-type

Discussion
We have demonstrated here that sleep spindles and intrathalamic SLOs are generated in the absence of CaV3.1 T-type
Ca2+ channels in TC neurons. This ﬁnding calls into question the
validity of the long-standing hypothesis that LTSs mediated by Ttype channels in TC neurons are essential for spindle oscillations.

channels in the generation of sleep spindles. However, the mean
episode duration and amplitude of barbiturate-induced spindles
were substantially reduced in CaV3.1−/− mice, in accordance with
our previous ﬁndings of a reduced EEG power density at delta
and spindle frequencies in CaV3.1−/− mice under high-dose
urethane (2 mg/kg), another spindle-inducing anesthesia (16).
These results suggest that T-type Ca2+ channels and the
resulting LTSs in TC neurons are not required for the generation
of spindle oscillations in TC circuits, but may play a role in enhancing the strength of spindles, as observed in barbiturateinduced spindles. This view is quite different from the classical
theory that the generation of sleep spindles requires low-threshold
burst ﬁring of TC neurons.
A recent study in mice lacking the CaV3.3 T-type channels
abundantly expressed in TRN found a selective reduction in
spindle power before the onset of REM sleep (30). The same
study also found that delta power was unaffected by the absence
of CaV3.3 channels (30), whereas CaV3.1−/− mice demonstrated
a signiﬁcantly reduced power density of the delta range (1–4 Hz)
during NREM sleep (16). These ﬁndings suggest that CaV3.3 Ttype Ca2+ channels in TRN neurons contribute to spindles,
whereas channels encoded by CaV3.1 genes in TC neurons
contribute to the delta waves during NREM sleep.
Firing Patterns During Spindle Oscillations in TC Neurons. We examined an intriguing question regarding the ﬁring pattern of TC
neurons that lack T-type channels in response to inhibitory
inputs from the TRN neurons during spindle episodes. Only
tonic spikes were observed in TC nuclei in CaV3.1−/− mice, as
expected (Fig. 3). Tonic spikes were more abundant than burst
spikes during spindles in CaV3.1+/+ TC neurons, whereas no
difference in tonic and burst spike frequency was seen during
nonspindle periods.

With regard to the critical role of tonic ﬁring in spindles, our
most compelling observation may be that in WT TC neurons, the
tonic spike frequency increases signiﬁcantly during cortical
spindle events compared with nonspindle periods. This pattern is
clearly different from that seen for burst spike frequency in WT
TC neurons, which is almost equal during spindle and nonspindle
periods. Of interest, the overall spike frequency during spindle
episodes in mutant TC neurons with no burst spikes did not
differ from that in WT TC neurons, because the degree of increase in tonic spike frequency during spindle periods was much
larger in mutant TC neurons. Nevertheless, the duration of
barbiturate-induced spindles was shorter in the mutant mice
compared with the WT mice (Fig. 2) even though the total spike
frequency was similar in the two mice during barbiturate-induced
spindles (Fig. 3), implying that TC burst ﬁring may play a role in
increasing the duration of barbiturate-induced spindle oscillations. The total spike frequency during nonspindle periods was
lower in mutant mice than in the WT mice, a ﬁnding that remains
to be explained.
The explicit induction of oscillations within an isolated CaV3.1−/−
intrathalamic circuit convinced us that spindle oscillations may be
generated within the TRN-TC network as suggested previously
(31), but in the absence of LTSs in TC neurons. We also conﬁrmed that deletion of CaV3.1 T-type channels had no effect on
the intrinsic ﬁring properties of TC neurons (Fig. 5). Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that spindle oscillations can be
generated and propagated via any type of TC spike activity as long
as TC neurons discharge spikes at an appropriate frequency. This
conclusion differs from previous observations on the critical role
of TC T-type channels in sleep delta waves (16) and paroxysmal
SWDs (13, 32, 33), and leads us to suggest that the various TC
oscillations may be generated through diverse mechanisms.

propagation of spindle oscillations. This study provides valuable
insights into the realm of T-type channels as a possible target for
differentiation of various TC oscillations and implies that the TC
oscillations generated under pathological conditions may be controlled by modulating T-type channels in TC neurons without affecting natural physiological sleep spindles. Our ﬁndings raise
further questions, including what drives TC neurons to ﬁre during
spindles and what determines the spindle frequency. Future
studies should be aimed at investigating the detailed mechanism
through which each type of TC oscillation is generated.

CaV3.1 T-Type Channels in Spindles vs. SWDs. It has been proposed
that TC oscillations occurring during sleep spindles and SWDs of
absence seizures share common elements and mechanisms (11).
Clinical observations of the temporal coincidence between sleep
spindles and SWDs and experimental ﬁndings showing that
penicillin, a weak GABAAR antagonist, induces the transformation of sleep spindles into SWDs gave rise to the view that SWDs
may be a perverted form of sleep spindles (34).
Previous studies have found that CaV3.1−/− mice are resistant
to GABAB receptor agonist-induced SWDs (13), and that deletion of CaV3.1 completely suppresses or markedly reduces
SWDs in genetic mouse models of absence seizures (35), implying that CaV3.1 T-type Ca2+ channels play a crucial role in the
genesis of SWDs. In contrast, the increased T-type Ca2+ currents
in TC neurons occur alongside the generation of SWDs and
absence seizure phenotypes in transgenic or mutant mice (32,
33). Our present ﬁndings support the hypothesis that CaV3.1 Ttype Ca2+ channels are not an essential component in the generation of sleep spindles. Overall, these results suggest that
paroxysmal TC oscillations during SWDs require the postinhibitory low-threshold burst ﬁring mediated by T-type channels
in TC neurons, whereas physiological TC oscillations during
sleep spindles do not.
In conclusion, our ﬁndings suggest that T-type Ca2+ channels
in TC neurons might not be essential for the generation and

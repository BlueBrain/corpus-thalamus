Neural ﬁeld dynamics with local and global
connectivity and time delay

Spatially continuous networks with heterogeneous connections are ubiquitous in biological
systems, in particular neural systems. To understand the mutual effects of locally
homogeneous and globally heterogeneous connectivity, we investigate the stability of the
rest-state activity of a neural ﬁeld as a function of its connectivity. The variation of the
connectivity is operationalized through manipulation of a heterogeneous two-point
connection embedded into the otherwise homogeneous connectivity matrix, as well as by
variation of connectivity strength and a ﬁnite transmission speed. The latter results in a
time delay of communication among individual brain areas. We demonstrate that the local
connectivity generates the well-known power-law behaviour of the electroencephalographic power spectrum with an exponent close to K2, whereas the global connections
generate a more characteristic line spectrum. These spectral characteristics are routinely
observed in large-scale topographies of the human brain.
Keywords: neural ﬁeld; connectivity; power-law behaviour; rest state; delay;

1. Introduction
Large-scale neural network models are thought to be involved in the
implementation of cognitive function of the brain (Bressler 1995, 2002, 2003;
Bullmore et al. 1996; Mesulam 1998; Mountcastle 1998; McIntosh 2000; Bressler &
Kelso 2001; Jirsa 2004; Bressler & Tognoli 2006; Bressler & McIntosh 2007). In
particular, peripheral areas are more functionally differentiated, whereas the
ensuing cognitive integration appears to require more global network activations.
The properties of the global network dynamics will then naturally depend on the
large-scale, i.e. global, connectivity of the network components, as well as their
local connectivity and dynamics (Sporns & Tononi 2002, 2007; Sporns 2003;
Jirsa 2004; Beggs et al. 2007). So far, theoretical efforts have focused almost
exclusively on the study of networks with discretely connected nodes and
complicated connectivity, but simple local dynamics, in which all neural activity is
lumped into a single neural mass (Lopes da Silva et al. 1974; Freeman 1975; van
Rotterdam et al. 1982; Tagamets & Horwitz 1998; David & Friston 2003; Jirsa &
Ding 2004; Campbell et al. 2006; see Ermentrout (1998) and Jirsa (2004)
for reviews).

As an additional complication, large-scale brain networks will be affected by
time delays via signal transmission along the connecting pathways. The time
delays may reach up to 200 ms (Nunez 1995) for the human brain, which is on a
similar time scale as human brain function and hence is not negligible. The
space–time structure of the couplings, i.e. coupling strength between areas (space)
and the time delay via transmission between areas (time), has speciﬁcally been
shown to contribute to the emergence of spontaneous coherent ﬂuctuations in the
resting brain (Ghosh et al. 2008a,b). Here, the authors used a biologically realistic
primate connectivity matrix with time delays. The individual network nodes were
neural population oscillators embedded into a network resting in its equilibrium
state. Under the inﬂuence of noise, the network dynamics intermittently exhibited
damped wave propagation, which was associated with the spatiotemporal waves
observed in human brain imaging studies. The authors demonstrated that
spatiotemporal correlations observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging
are captured by the network model only when time delays are taken into account.
These correlations reﬂect correlated oscillatory activity on ultra-slow scales, less
than 0.1 Hz. On faster time scales, 10–500 ms, the neural activity displays
irregular, though characteristic, rhythms captured by electroencephalography
(EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Although the modelling study by
Ghosh et al. (2008a,b) explains the generation of these rhythms and the dominant
peaks in the power spectra, it entirely lacks the ubiquitous characteristic powerlaw behaviour of spectral power (see Buzsaki (2006) for a range of exponents).
A possible explanation for the absence of this feature is the implementation of
single neural oscillators as the network nodes rather than the more realistic
spatially expanded neural ﬁelds of population activity. Neural ﬁelds describe the
temporal change of neural activity on a local spatial scale, typically within a brain
area (Wilson & Cowan 1972; Wilson et al. 1973; Amari 1977; Bressloff & Coombes
1997; Atay & Hutt 2005; Hutt & Atay 2005; see Ermentrout (1998), Jirsa (2004)
and Coombes (2005) for reviews). These approaches use a translationally
invariant, so-called homogeneous, connectivity and also take time delays into
consideration, which, however, given the small spatial extent of a brain area
(as compared to the whole brain), play a smaller role.
When considering large-scale brain dynamics as in the resting brain activity,
or generally for all cognitive function, theoretical and analytical means must be
developed that are speciﬁcally targeted to the properties of large-scale network
dynamics integrating local and global contributions. Existing attempts so far
include neural ﬁeld theories that approximate the large-scale components of the
connectivity matrix as translationally invariant and exponentially decaying over
space, but on a larger spatial scale than biologically realistic (Nunez 1974;
Wright & Liley 1995; Jirsa & Haken 1996; Jirsa et al. 1997; Robinson et al. 1997;
Breakspear 2004). These approaches have been successful in capturing various
phenomena of large-scale brain dynamics, including characteristic EEG power
spectra (Nunez 1974; Robinson et al. 1997), epilepsy (Breakspear et al. 2006) and
MEG activity during sensorimotor coordination (Jirsa & Haken 1996; Jirsa et al.
1997). No systematic investigation, however, has been performed so far to test
the validity of the translationally invariant approximation. There are only a few
recent studies exploring the effects of global connecting pathways upon the local
dynamics of coupled brain areas (see Jirsa & Kelso 2000; Qubbaj & Jirsa 2007).
In the current paper, we wish to focus upon the contributions of the local

connectivity to the large-scale dynamics of the entire network, in particular on
its effects captured by the power spectrum. To do so, we identify a convenient
mathematical representation for the network dynamics with a locally invariant
(homogeneous) and globally variant (heterogeneous) architecture via a onedimensional spatiotemporally continuous integro-differential ﬁeld equation with
space-dependent delay (following Jirsa & Kelso 2000; Qubbaj & Jirsa 2007). We
demonstrate that the local connections contribute to the generation of spectral
power-law behaviour with an exponent of K2, whereas the global connectivity is
involved in the generation of the characteristic frequency peaks.
2. Mathematical basis of neural ﬁeld dynamics
Let j(x,t) be the neural ﬁeld capturing the population activity at time point t
and position x. The dynamics of the neural ﬁeld can then be described by the
following integro-differential equation:
ð

jðx; tÞ ZKe jðx; tÞ C Whom ðjx K yjÞS ½jðy; tKjx K yj=cÞ dy

Whet ðx; yÞS ½jðy; tKjx Kyj=vÞ dy;

ð2:1Þ

where 1/eO02R represents the intrinsic time scale. The dot indicates the ﬁrst
time derivative. The spatial domain of the neural ﬁeld is denoted by G, where
x 2 GZ[0,L] and L is the spatial length of the neural ﬁeld. The homogeneous
connectivity function, Whom(jxKyj), is translationally invariant. If the
connectivity function does not have such properties, then we call it heterogeneous, Whet(x,y)sWhet(jxKyj). The parameters c and v are the propagation
velocities through the homogeneous and heterogeneous connections, respectively.
(a ) Local homogeneous connectivity is translationally invariant
For the moment, consider only the homogeneous connectivity term. By using
the properties of delta functions, the system can be written as follows:

that are thought to be involved in working memory.

Consider a diffusively coupled neural ﬁeld with a heterogeneous connection at
two points of the ﬁeld. Then the neural ﬁeld dynamics is determined by equation
(2.19). If we set DZ0, the system reduces to that of two coupled oscillators
described by the following delay differential equation:

Following Jirsa & Ding (2004), we can decompose B according
pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ to BZE LE,

contains the corresponding eigenvectors e^. Multiplying (3.2) from the left with

If we set the eigenmodes to uðtÞZ e^xðtÞ, equation (3.3) reduces to a decoupled

The stability properties of the above one-dimensional delay differential equation
have been widely studied. Assuming a solution of the form u(t)Zelt, l2C, the
stability condition is determined by the following characteristic equation:
H ðlÞ Z l C eKbe Klt Z 0:

ð3:5Þ

Notice that any solution of (3.4) satisfying Re[l]!0 is stable and when Re[l]
becomes positive the system destabilizes. On the critical surface parametrized by
e, m12, m21 and t, the solution l of the characteristic equation is purely imaginary,
i.e., lZIm[l]Ziu, u 2RC
0 . This surface represents the boundary at which the
system changes stability and is shown in ﬁgure 2. A stability change through
Re[l]ZN is impossible (Datko 1978), hence every instability must occur at the
surface deﬁned by lZiu.

The example of two coupled oscillators, DZ0, represents the extreme case
where only global interactions are present. To study the interplay between the
local and global modes in the system with local diffusive coupling, we need to
consider Ds0. Note that D must be sufﬁciently large to have an effect. In turn,
this contributes signiﬁcantly to the large-scale dynamics of the system, for which
we assume the following ansatz:

characteristic equation (3.11) and the effect of diffusion on the stability surface,
we will discuss the fully symmetric case, m12Zm21Zm. The approach generalizes
for any combination of m12 and m21 (see also Jirsa & Ding 2004; Qubbaj & Jirsa
2007). Then the characteristic equation (3.11) reduces to

Both equations must be satisﬁed for an instability to exist. Squaring and summing
the two right-hand sides of (3.13) and (3.14), we obtain the dispersion relation
u2Zm2 cos2(kd )K(Dk 2Ce)2, which is plotted in ﬁgure 3a. For increasing
wavenumber k, fewer frequencies u are available, since u2 becomes negative.
The smaller the diffusion constant D is, the more frequencies will be available.
Consider equation (3.13), which is plotted in ﬁgure 3b for the critical value utZ0
(at which jcos(ut)j%1 is the largest). There will be an intersection of the two
curves that gives the value of k of the destabilizing mode. It is evident from
ﬁgure 3b that the uniform mode, kZ0, is the mode closest to the instability for
mO0 with DO0 and eO0. If there are multiple intersections (depending on the
time delay t and other parameters), a discrete line spectrum will be possible.
Modes with increasing wavenumber have an increasingly smaller degree of
instability, when the vertical distance in ﬁgure 3b between mt cos(kd ) and Dk 2Ce
increases. Since the degree of stability scales monotonically with the distance
between these curves, our reasoning holds. In other words, modes with larger
wavenumber k are more strongly damped.

(dashed-dotted line), purely heterogeneous (dashed line) and both homogeneous and heterogeneous
(full line), i.e. mixed, connections have been numerically integrated in the presence of white noise.
A spectral peak occurs for purely heterogeneous and mixed connectivity. A 1/f 2 behaviour of the
spectra is seen for purely homogeneous and mixed connectivity. Here, we show the results of
simulations with m12ZKm21, where the spectral peak is most prevalent. The dotted line shows a
slope of K2.

We illustrate these effects in a simulation of equation (2.12) with white
noise. The parameters are chosen such that the equilibrium state of the neural
ﬁeld is stable, but close to instability. As a consequence, the ﬂuctuations
continually kick the system out of its equilibrium, which then exhibits a
characteristic transient dynamics back to equilibrium. The global ﬁeld power, i.e.,
the spatial integral over the power spectra of the neural ﬁeld, is plotted in ﬁgure 4
for various conﬁgurations of connectivity. In all cases there is a 1/f 2 behaviour of
the spectra for higher frequencies. However, the neural ﬁelds with homogeneous
connectivity show enhanced power in the low-frequency regions, which is not the
case for the purely heterogeneously connected network. The discrete spectral peak
in ﬁgure 4 is a consequence of the interactions between the two heterogeneously
coupled regions. To allow for a comparison with experimental data, we show the
power spectrum of human rest-state EEG in ﬁgure 5. The data have been obtained
from a single electrode located in the centre of the scalp (Cz) during a 4 min
recording session with eyes closed. The power spectrum shows power-law
behaviour with an exponent of slightly less than K2 over a large frequency
range with a spectral peak in the so-called alpha range, approximately 8–12 Hz.
4. Conclusions
In this paper, we discussed a key issue in the ﬁeld of biologically realistic largescale networks, that is, the interplay between local and global architectures
leading to a large-scale network dynamics. To gain insight into the interplay
between local and global architectural components, we operationalized the global
connectivity by a two-point connection with a ﬁnite transmission speed. In real

Figure 5. Human EEG power spectrum of the rest state. One representative power spectrum of a
single electrode (Cz) is shown, which displays power-law behaviour with an exponent close to K2.
A spectral peak is found at around 8–12 Hz known as alpha rhythm. The data have been collected

networks, obviously more complicated connectivity prevails, resulting in a rich
spatiotemporal brain dynamics on multiple scales (see Ghosh et al. (2008b) for a
detailed modelling study with realistic primate connectivity). Evidently the
resulting power spectra will also be a function of the degree of complexity of the
large-scale connectivity skeleton. For this reason, our simplistic architecture and
neural ﬁeld dynamics may serve only as a toy model to discuss the interplay
between local homogeneous and global heterogeneous brain connectivity effects.
As a consequence, the details of the dynamic effects of certain parameter changes
should not be thought of as representative for the fully connected brain.
For instance, our toy model of a two-point connection in a neural ﬁeld shows
oscillatory instabilities for m12ZKm21 (see ﬁgure 4), which corresponds to a link
with an excitatory terminal on one end and an inhibitory terminal on the other.
Such a conﬁguration is not biologically realized, since all large-scale pathways
have excitatory terminals. For purely excitatory ﬁbres, m12, m21O0, the ﬁrst
instability is mostly non-oscillatory, as we showed in the previous section and in
ﬁgure 3. Higher instabilities include oscillatory dynamics of non-uniform spatial
modes, but occur when the spatially uniform mode, kZ0, is already unstable.
Still they are visible in the presence of noise, when the neural ﬁeld returns to its
stable rest state, but less prevalent. Although, it is evident that an arbitrary
connectivity matrix can be constructed from the linear sum of two-point
connections, an understanding of how the connectivity inﬂuences the network
dynamics remains to be developed. It is in this sense that our discussion of a
two-point connection and network dynamics should be seen as illustrative.
However, it does shed light on the following aspect of large-scale brain dynamics:
a heterogeneous large-scale connectivity provides the skeleton for a set of neural
populations connected via pathways with transmission delays. It can be as simple
as presented here, i.e. a two-point connection, or as biologically realistic
(and complicated) as in Ghosh et al. (2008b). When the neural populations at
the nodes of the network are expanded from a point in space to a neural ﬁeld with
local short-range connectivity in space, then this expansion in space will enhance
the 1/f 2 behaviour in the power spectrum, as we showed here. Since this

characteristic is in the ﬁrst place independent of the details of the local connectivity
(as long as the rest state remains stable), the power-law behaviour with an exponent
close to K2 will be ubiquitous.

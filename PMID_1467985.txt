In the present study, we examined the distribution of calretinin-immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies and fibers in the lateral geniculate nucleus
of the rat. In normal rats, clusters of immunoreactive cell bodies were found in: (i) the rostral portion of the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus
pars medialis (VLGM), (ii) the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), (iii) the intermediate region between the VLGM and the ventral lateral geniculate
nucleus pars lateralis (VLGL), (iv) the caudomedial portion of the VLGM, and (v) the caudolateral portion of the VLGM. In the dorsal lateral
geniculate nucleus (DLG), immunoreactive cell bodies were rarely observed. After uni- or bilateral eye enucleation, no significant alteration in
the morphological features or distribution of immunoreactive cell bodies was detected in the lateral geniculate nucleus. In normal rats,
immunoreactive fibers formed dense plexuses in: (i) the DLG, (ii) the external layer of the VLGL, (iii) the internal layer of the VLGL, (iv) the
IGL, (v) the caudomedial portion of the VLGM, and (vi) the optic tract. After unilateral eye enucleation, immunoreactive fibers in the external
layer of the VLGL and in the optic tract almost totally disappeared on the contralateral side to the lesion. Unilateral eye enucleation caused a
significant decrease of immunoreactive fibers in the DLG and in the internal layer of the VLGL, but a substantial number of immunoreactive
fibers still remained there. In the IGL and the caudomedial portion of the VLGM, no observable alteration in the distribution of immunoreactive
fibers was detected after uni- or bilateral eye enucleation. In conclusion, (i) subpopulations of neurons of the lateral geniculate nucleus are
distinguished by the presence of calretinin immunoreactivity, and (ii) calretinin is a chemical component of subpopulations of the contralateral
retino-geniculate pathway, which terminate in the DLG and in the external and internal layers of the VLGL.

INTRODUCTION
The lateral geniculate nucleus is one component of
the central visual pathwaysa°. The antero- and retrograde tracing and degeneration studies have demonstrated that the retinal afferents terminate in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (DLG), ventral lateral
geniculate nucleus (VLG) and intergeniculate leaflet
(IGL) of the rat (for review see refs. 30 and 37). In the
rabbit, a subpopulation of the retino-geniculate projection, which terminates in the superficial portion of the
DLG, has been chemically identified by immunohistochemistry of substance p6. In the rat, a dipeptide,
N-acetylaspartyl glutamate, has been shown as a chemical component of the retinal afferents to the DLG ~. A
retinal afferent to the VLG of the rat, however, has
never been characterized by its chemical features.

Distinct populations of neurons and fiber connections in the central nervous system of the rat were
distinguished by the location of specific calcium-binding proteins, such as parvalbumin, calbindin-D28K and
calretinin 2,s,16,35. Although the localization of calretinin
has never been extensively examined throughout the
rat lateral geniculate nucleus, calretinin-immunoreactire cell bodies and fibers in the nucleus have been
demonstrated by the studies of brain m a p s 2'm6'35. Ganglion cells of the rat retina have been shown to contain
calretinin immunoreactivity 3L42. Thus, a possibility can
be considered that the retino-geniculate projection system of the rat may contain calretinin.
In the present study, we focused on the lateral
geniculate nucleus of the rat and examined thoroughly
by use of immunohistochemistry the distribution of
calretinin'c°ntaining cell bodies and fibers in the nu-

for 30 rain at 4°C, and then immersed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
containing 20% sucrose for 48 b at 4°C. Serial sections of the lateral
geniculate nucleus were cut on a cryostat in a frontal plane at 20 p.m
and collected in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Sections of
the lateral geniculate nucleus were divided i~to four sets, each set
consisting of every fourth serial section. Sections of the first set were
processed for calretinin immunohistochemistry. Sections of the second set were stained with thionin for demarcation of the anatomical
regions• Other sections were used for further observations and for an
immunohistochemical control.

cleus. In addition, with eye enucleation, we chemically
identified subpopulations of the retino-geniculate pathways by calretinin immunoreactivity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals
Sixteen male Spraque-Dawley rats weighing 140-280 g were
used. The animals were divided into two groups: intact rats (n -- 4)
for determining the normal distribution of calretinin-immunoreactive
structures in the lateral geniculate nucleus, and unilaterally ( n - - 6 )
and bilaterally (n -- 6) eye-enucleated rats for determining the area
receiving calretinin-immunoreactive retino-geniculate projections.
Eye enucleation was performed under aneasthesia with Chloropent
(Fort Dodge Labs.). Eye-enucleated ra~" were allowed to survive for
7 days.

lmmunohistochemistry
An antiserum was raised in a rabbit against calretinin purified
from the guinea pig brain 4z. With the antiserum, calretinin immunoreactivity was detected by use of a streptavidin-peroxidase
conjugate 3s. The sections were incubated in the following solutions:
(i) 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature; (it) 5%
normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature; (it) anticalretinin antiserum (1:2,500 in PBS)with 2% normal goat serum for
48 h at 4°C; (iv) biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G
(Vector, 1:400 in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature; (v) streptavidinperoxidase (Kirkegaard & Perry Lab., 1:100 in PBS) for 2 h at room
temperature. Tissue-bound peroxidase activity was visualized by incubating sections with 0.025% 3,3'-diamino-benzidine (Sigma), 0.6%
nickel ammonium sulfate (Fisher) and 0.006% hydrogen peroxide in

Tissue preparation
Intact and eye-enucleated rats, under anesthesia with sodium
pentobarbital, were perfused transcardially with 100 ml of 0.01 M
phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), followed by 200 ml of a fixative
containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4,
4°C). The brains were dissected out and placed in the same fixative

sections were rinsed in P B S for 30 min at room temperature.
In a control for the immunohistochemical staining, we omitted

the primary antiserum. No immunolabeling was found under the

antisera may cross-react with calbindin-D28k because o f a high
degree of homology between calretinin and c a l b i n d i n - D 2 8 k 34. In the
c+~,. of the anti-calretinin antiserum used in the present study,
however, this possibility is e x c l u d e d by the following d a t a : (i) we have
previously done the preadsorption control using calretinin purified
f r o m the guinea pig brain n6'42 and from the rat brain 2, and no
immunohistochemical staining has been found, (ii) the anti-calretinin
antiserum has detected only calretinin but not c a l b i n d i n - D 2 8 k o n a
protein blot of the guinea pig brain sample 42, (iii) the antiserum has
not detected cells of the red nucleus, nucleus of the trapezoid body,
inferior olive, o r P u r k i n j e cells o f the cerebellum 2, although these
cells were immunostained by anti-calbindin-D28k a n t i s e r a 4"s'nLxT'36.
Furthermore, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum have been also imm u n o s t a i n e d by anti-parvalbumin antisera s'3~, whereas the cells have
not been detected by our anti-calretinin antiserum 2'42.

Data analysis
Localization o f calretirfin-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers
was determined by e x a m i n i n g the immunostained sections and the
adjacent thionin-stained sections under a Leitz light microscope. The
literature ~°'~2,4° was consulted to delineate the subdivisions of the
lateral geniculate nucleus and the surrounding areas. By comparing
the distribution of calretinin-immunoreactive fibers in normal rats
and that in eye-enucleated rats, calretinin-containing retino-geniculate pathway terminating fields were examined.

Localization of calretinin in normal rats
Calretinin immunoreactivity was detected within cell
bodies and fibers in the lateral geniculate nucleus of
intact rats. The morphological appearance of immunoreactive structures suggests that they are neuronal elements. Fig. 1 shows the perspectives of the
lateral geniculate nucleus on immunostained sections
of a normal rat at six representative levels. The DLG
had a similar distribution pattern of calretinin immunoreactivity over its rostrocaudal extent, whereas
the VLG had a great diversity of its localization at the
different rostrocaudal levels. Fig. 2 illustrates the distribution of calretinin-immunoreactive cell bodies (Fig.
2A-F) and fibers (Fig. 2a-f) in the VLG and the IGL
at the levels corresponding to those of Fig. 1. Fig. 3
shows major calretinin-immunoreactive structures in
the lateral geniculate nucleus.

lateral aspect of the VLGM at the caudal level (Figs.

polar cells (Fig. 3F), and this cluster extended ventromedially and continued to the zona incerta (ZI) (Figs.

(Figs. IE,F and 2E,F) had a higher packing density of
immunoreactive cells than the cluster of the caudolateral VLGM (Figs. 1F and 2F). A few immunoreactive
cell bodies were dispersed in the remaining regions of
the VLG (Figs. 1 and 2A-F). In the DLG, immunoreactive cell bodies were rarely observed.
Of all calretinin-immunoreactive cells in the VLG,
approximately 20% were found in the IGL, 10% in the
caudomedial portion of the VLGM, 9% in the rostral

rats. The distribution of immunoreactive fibers in the
lateral geniculate nucleus was altered by uni- and bilateral eye enucleation as follows:

sisted of rod-like varicosities and long fibers extending
in a dorsomedial to ventrolateral direction (Fig. 3A),
and the density of immunoreactive fibers was higher in
the outer portion than in the inner portion (Fig. 1).
Immunoreactive fibers in the external and internal
layers of the VLGL, in the IGL, and in the caudomedial portion of VLGM were composed of fine dot-like
structures. The two layers of the immunoreactive fiber
plexuses in the VLGL were prominent with a paucity
of immunoreactivity between the two layers at the
middle level of the rostrocaudal extent (Figs. 1D and
2d). The two layers were in close proximity at the
rostral levels (Figs• 1A-C; 2a-c), and only the external
layer remained at the caudal levels (Figs. 1E,F and
2e,f). The optic tract contained a dense bundle of
immunoreactive fibers (Fig. 1).

Unilateral eye enucleation
After unilateral eye enucleation, changes in the
distribution of immunoreactive fibers in the lateral
geniculate nucleus were obseved only on the contralateral side to the lesion (Figs. 4B and 5B,D,F), but no
significant alteration was detected o~ the ,.'psilateral
side (Figs. 4A and 5A,C,E). Immunoreactive fine dotlike fibers in the external layer of the VLGL and
immunoreactive fibers in the optic tract almost totally
disappeared on the contralateral side after unilateral
eye enucleation (Figs. 4B and 5B,D,F). Unilateral eye
enucleation caused a significant decrease of immunoreactive rod-like fibers and long fibers in the DLG (Fig.
4B) and of immunoreactive fine dot-like fibers in the
internal layer of the VLGL (Figs. 4B and 5D), but a
substantial number of immunoreactive fibers still remained in these regions (Figs. 4B and 5D). In the IGL
(Figs. 4B and 5D) and in the caudomedial portion of
the VLGM (Fig. 5F), no significant alteration in the
distribution of immunoreactive fibers was found after
unilateral eye enucleation.

bilateral eye enucleation cause the same alteration in
the distribution of immunoreactive fibers in the lateral
geniculate nucleus (Fig. 4B,C). As compared with normal rats, the distribution of immunoreactive fibers in
the IGL or in the caudomedial portion of the VLGM
was not observably changed after bilateral eye enucleation (Fig. 4C). Bilateral eye enucleation caused a
significant decrease of immunoreactive fibers in the
DLG and in the internal layer of the VLGL, but a
substantial number of the fibers still remained there
(Fig. 4C). Immunoreactive fine dot-like fibers in the
external layer of the VLGL and immunoreactive fibers
in the optic tract almost totally disappeared after bilateral eye enucleation (Fig. 4C).
DISCUSSION

,

.

We have shown in the present study that: (i) well
defined subpopulations of neurons are present within
the lateral geniculate nucleus, which exhibit calretinin
immunoreactivity, and (ii) calretinin is a chemical component of subpopulations of the contralateral retinogeniculate pathway, which terminate in the DLG and
in the external and internal layers of the VLGL.

Bilateral eye enucleation
There was no difference in the distribution of immunoreactive fibers between the left and right lateral
genicvlate nuclei of bilaterally eye-enucleated rats. In
comparison with the lateral geniculate nucleus on the
contralateral side of unilaterally eye-enucleated rats,

Comparison of the results with the distribution of other
neuroactive substances
A cluster of calretinin-immunoreactive cells were
present in the IGL. In the IGL, some neurons having
neuropetide Y projected to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and other cells containing enkephalin sent axons
to the contralateral IGL7. The morphology of these
cells~ is similar to that of calretinin-containing cells in
the IGL. It can be considered that these calretinin
neurons may contain neuropeptide Y or enkephalin
and may project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus o r
contralateral IGL. Further studies are necessary
to examine this possibility, y-Aminobutyric acid
(GABA) 27'4l- and substance p4t-containing neurons
were also present in the IGL with a distribution that is
probably coextensive with calretinin-stained cells.
In addition, the distribution of calretinin-containing
cells overlaps that of enkephalin-immunoreactive neurons 24'41 in the intermediate region between the VLGL
and the VLGM. The cluster of calretinin-containing
cells in the rostral VLGM has never been chemically
identified by fluorescence histochemical or immunohistochemical studies for monoamines 9a°Ag,22,39, acetylcholine 3as'25, amino acids 27'28,29 or neuropeptides 2°'24'41.

Retino-geniculate pathways
The present results of eye enucleation suggest that
subpopulations of the contralateral retino-geniculate

221

projection contain calretinin, which terminate in the
DLG and in the external and internal layers of the
VLGL. Thus, calretinin can be used as a marker protein for subpopulations of the retino-geniculate pathway. It would be of interest to identify with calretinin
immunoreactivity the retinal afferent terminals in the
lateral geniculate nucleus at ultrastructural levels,
which so far have been identified by degenerating
changes (for example, ref. 21), and new findings may
be provided for the synaptic organization of the retinal
afferents in the lateral geniculate nucleus. It is worthy
of notice, however, that a substantial number of caketinin-containing fibers in the DLG, or in the internal
layer of the VLGL, are not of retinal origin.
Anterograde tracing studies have revealed that all of
the VLGL is uniformly covered by the contralateral
retino-geniculate projection 12'13'33 and that the IGL
also receives retinal afferents t3. In contrast, calretinincontaining retinal afferents terminated only in the two
layers of the VLGL with a region of fewer calretininimmunoreactive fibers between the two layers. In addition, calretinin is not a major component of the retinoIGL pathway, because no change of calretinin-containing fibers in the IGL was observed after eye enucleation. Therefore, the retino-geniculate pathway consists of calretinin- and non-calretinin-containing fibers.
It should be noted that, in the rabbit, contralateral
retinal afferents terminate in two distinct layers in the
alpha sector, which corresponds to the VLGL of the
rat, with a small region between the two layers that
receives ipsilateral retinal afferents ~4.
Retinotopic organization was seen in the VLG 2~ as
well as in the DLG 23 of the ~at. Ganglion cells and
their axons in the rat retina were shown to contain
calretinin by immunohistochemistry with transverse
sections 3.'42. The possibility exists that the calretinincontaining retino-geniculate pathway may originate
from restricted ganglion cells that possess calretinin. In
order to examine this hypothesis, it is needed to localize calretinin-containing ganglion cells in a whole
mount retina.
Our understanding of the possible functions of calretinin is still limited, therefore the physiological role
of calretinin in neurons remains speculative. Calretinin
has a similar Ca2+-binding site structure (EF-hand) as
other calcium-binding proteins including calmodulin,
calbindin-D28k and parvaibumin *s. Among the functions which these calcium-binding proteins are thought
to participate in are phosphorylation and Cae+-buffer ing (for review, see ref. 5). It seems possible that
calretinin is involved in similar functions.

Heterogeneity of firing properties among rat thalamic
reticular nucleus neurons

The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) provides inhibitory innervation to most thalamic relay
nuclei and receives excitatory innervation from both cortical and thalamic neurons. Ultimately,
information transfer through the thalamus to the neocortex is strongly influenced by TRN. In
addition, the reciprocal synaptic connectivity between TRN with associated thalamic relay nuclei
is critical in generating intrathalamic rhythmic activities that occur during certain arousal states
and pathophysiological conditions. Despite evidence suggesting morphological heterogeneity
amongst TRN neurons, the heterogeneity of intrinsic properties of TRN neurons has not been
systematically examined. One key characteristic of virtually all thalamic neurons is the ability to
produce action potentials in two distinct modes: burst and tonic. In this study, we have examined
the prevalence of burst discharge within TRN neurons. Our intracellular recordings revealed that
TRN neurons can be differentiated by their action potential discharge modes. The majority of
neurons in the dorsal TRN (56%) lack burst discharge, and the remaining neurons (35%) show
an atypical burst that consists of an initial action potential followed by small amplitude, long
duration depolarizations. In contrast, most neurons in ventral TRN (82%) display a stereotypical
burst discharge consisting of a transient, high frequency discharge of multiple action potentials.
TRN neurons that lack burst discharge typically did not produce low threshold calcium spikes
or produced a significantly reduced transient depolarization. Our findings clearly indicate that
TRN neurons can be differentiated by differences in their spike discharge properties and these
subtypes are not uniformly distributed within TRN. The functional consequences of
such intrinsic differences may play an important role in modality-specific thalamocortical
information transfer as well as overall circuit level activities.

The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a thin shell of
GABA-containing neurons surrounding the anterolateral
regions of the dorsal thalamus providing synaptic
innervation of underlying thalamic relay nuclei. TRN
neurons receive synaptic input from collaterals of
thalamocortical and corticothalamic neurons, and thus
these cells are in a unique position to provide feed-back
inhibition to thalamic relay nuclei from thalamocortical
neurons and feed-forward inhibition by way of corticothalamic neurons. The inhibitory influence on relay
neurons can regulate the transfer of sensory information
from the dorsal thalamus to the neocortex as demonstrated
by changes in receptive fields of dorsal thalamic neurons
following manipulation of TRN neuronal activity (Hale
et al. 1982; Ahls´en et al. 1985; Shosaku et al. 1989; Lee
et al. 1994). In addition, as a result of the reciprocal
synaptic relationship between TRN and thalamic relay
nuclei, TRN neurons play a critical role in intrathalamic
rhythmic activities similar to those observed during

various sleep states and absence epilepsy (Steriade et al.
1993; von Krosigk et al. 1993; Warren et al. 1994;
Huguenard & Prince, 1994; Cox et al. 1997b; Lee &
Cox, 2006). In addition, it appears that TRN may
serve to relay information between first-order (primary
sensory) thalamic nuclei and higher-order thalamic
nuclei (Crabtree et al. 1998; Crabtree, 1999; Crabtree &
Isaac, 2002). Thus, TRN appears to play several critical
roles in thalamocortical circuit function, and a clear
understanding of intrinsic properties of these cells may
allow a better understanding of their functional role.
With regards to intrinsic properties, TRN neurons
have long been considered a relatively homogeneous
population of GABA-containing neurons that provide
diffuse inhibitory influence on thalamocortical neurons.
Several studies have differentiated TRN neuron subtypes
based solely upon morphological criteria including soma
size, soma shape, dendritic architecture, and axonal arbor
morphology (Scheibel & Scheibel, 1966; Jones, 1975;

Houser et al. 1980; Yen et al. 1985; Domich et al. 1986;
Spreafico et al. 1988; Avanzini et al. 1989; Spreafico et al.
1991; Contreras et al. 1993; Cox et al. 1996). Despite
anatomical evidence supportive of multiple TRN neuron
subtypes, the functional significance of these distinct
subpopulations is rather limited (Cox et al. 1997a).
One common characteristic of virtually all thalamic
neurons including TRN neurons is the presence of two
distinct modes of action potential discharge: burst and
tonic modes (Domich et al. 1986; Mulle et al. 1986;
Steriade et al. 1986; Spreafico et al. 1988). Burst mode
is characterized by a transient high-frequency action
potential discharge that is dependent on activation of
transient, low threshold voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.
This firing mode appears critical for the maintenance of
intrathalamic rhythms and may serve unique functions in
information processing (Glenn & Steriade, 1982; Jahnsen
& Llin´as, 1984a; Coulter et al. 1989; Steriade et al. 1993;
von Krosigk et al. 1993; Lisman, 1997; Sherman & Guillery,
2002). Although limited observations suggest that some
TRN neurons do not produce burst discharge, these studies
have not systematically addressed this issue (Contreras
et al. 1992; Brunton & Charpak, 1997).
The TRN is topographically organized by modality,
and thereby is subdivided into several sectors based on
efferent and afferent connections to modality specific
thalamic and neocortical regions. In general, ventral,
anterolateral, dorsocaudal, and ventrocaudal TRN are
loosely associated with somatosensory, motor, visual and
auditory modalities, respectively, on the basis of the
anatomical and physiological data (Jones, 1975; Hale
et al. 1982; French et al. 1985; Shosaku et al. 1989;
Conley & Diamond, 1990; Crabtree, 1992, 1996; Bourassa
et al. 1995; Pinault et al. 1995a; Coleman & Mitrofanis,
1996; Crabtree et al. 1998). In the present study, we
found three distinct TRN neuron subtypes based on their
action potential discharge properties: non-burst, atypical
burst and typical burst neurons. Furthermore, these
different TRN neuron subtypes are not homogeneously
distributed within TRN. In dorsal TRN regions, virtually
all neurons were non-burst or atypical burst neurons.
In contrast, the overwhelming majority of neurons in
the ventral TRN region produce typical burst discharge
(typical burst). While the functional role of non-burst
neurons remains speculative, the dorsal TRN is generally
associated with visually related modality, so these unique
non-burst neurons may have important function in visual
information processing. Some of these findings have been
presented in abstract form (Lee et al. 2004).
Methods
Thalamic slice preparation

The procedures used in these experiments were similar
to those previously described (Lee & Cox, 2003).

J Physiol 582.1

Young Sprague–Dawley rats (postnatal age 10–28 days)
were deeply anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(50 mg kg−1 , i.p. injection) and decapitated. All procedures
closely followed guidelines put forth by the Department of
Animal Resources at the University of Illinois. The brain
was quickly removed and placed into cold, oxygenated
slicing medium containing (mm): 2.5 KCl, 10.0 MgCl2 ,
0.5 CaCl2 , 1.25 NaH2 PO4 , 26.0 NaHCO3 , 11.0 glucose,
and 234.0 sucrose. Serial horizontal brain slices (300 μm
thickness) were cut using a vibrating tissue slicer and
collected from dorsal to ventral regions of TRN: the 1st
and 2nd slices from the dorsal extent of TRN are referred
to as dorsal TRN slices (dTRN). The 3rd and 4th slices
are referred to as ventral TRN slices (vTRN). The 1st to
4th slices roughly correspond to Bregma −4.74, −5.10,
−5.32 and −5.60, respectively (Fig. 1; Paxinos & Watson,
1986). The posterior commissure, fasciculus retroflexus
and dLGN were used to distinguish the level of each slice.
The fasciculus retroflexus appears in the 2nd slice as a
large diameter structure, but appears as a relatively diffuse
myelinated tract with a smaller diameter in the 3rd and
4th slices. The posterior commissure clearly crosses the
midline in the 1st and 2nd slices, but appears interrupted
in the 3rd and 4th slices (e.g. Fig. 1).
Thalamic slices were transferred to a holding chamber,
and incubated at least 1 h before recording. Individual
slices were then transferred to a recording chamber, and
continuously superfused with oxygenated physiological
saline at 30◦ C. The physiological solution contained (mm):
126.0 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.0 MgCl2 , 2.0 CaCl2 , 1.25 NaH2 PO4 ,
26.0 NaHCO3 , and 10.0 glucose. This solution was gassed
with 95% O2 –5% CO2 to a final pH of 7.4. In experiments
using 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), the physiological solution
contained (mm): 126.0 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.0 MgCl2 , 2.0 CaCl2 ,
10.0 Hepes, and 10.0 glucose. This solution was gassed with
100% O2 . All chemical used in this study were purchased
from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA).

Intracellular recording procedures

Intracellular recordings, using the whole-cell
configuration were obtained with the visual aid of a
modified Nikon microscope equipped with differential
interference contrast optics. For intracellular recordings,
individual slices were transferred to a submersion-type
recording chamber. A low power objective (×4) was used
to identify the level of each slice as well as the TRN, and
a high-power water immersion objective (×40) was used
to visualize individual TRN neurons. Recording pipettes
were pulled from 1.5 mm outer diameter capillary tubing
and had tip resistances of 3–6 M when filled with the
following intracellular solution containing (mm): 117.0
potassium gluconate, 13.0 KCl, 1.0 MgCl2 , 0.07 CaCl2 ,
0.1 EGTA, 10.0 Hepes, 2.0 Na2 -ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, and

0.3% biocytin. The pH was adjusted to 7.3 and osmolarity
was adjusted to 290–300 mosmol l−1 . The initial access
resistances ranged from 7 to 20 M and remained stable
in recordings included for analyses in this study. An
Axoclamp2B or Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used in bridge mode
for voltage recordings or discontinuous single electrode
voltage clamp mode for current recordings (Axoclamp
2A). Current and voltage protocols were generated using
pCLAMP software (Molecular Devices) and data were
stored on computer. For current-clamp recordings, an
active bridge circuit was continuously monitored and
adjusted to balance the drop in potential produced by
passing current through the recording electrode. For
voltage clamp recordings, the amplifier was used in

discontinuous mode. In these recordings, the switching
frequency ranged from 2.5 to 3.5 kHz with a gain of
150–300 pA mV−1 , and the headstage was continually
monitored to ensure that the current transients had
completely decayed before voltage measurements.
Histological procedures

Biocytin was included in the recording pipette in order
to reconstruct the morphology of recorded neurons.
After recording, slices were fixed overnight in 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).
Slices were then reacted with avidin–biotin–peroxidase
complex (ABC Elite, Vector Laboratories, CA, USA) using
established procedures in our laboratory (Horikawa &

characteristics. They have fusiform somas and several primary dendrites that extend from each pole of the cell
body and are orientated to the longitudinal axis of the TRN. However, a subpopulation of all three subtype TRN
neurons also has somewhat round-shaped soma with multipolar dendrites (iv), suggesting morphological diversity
within each subtype. Scale bar, 100 μM. C, caudal; R, rostral; M, medial; L, lateral.

Armstrong, 1988; Govindaiah & Cox 2004). Subsequently,
slices were mounted and the neurons were examined using
a light microscope.
The distribution of individual neurons within the
TRN (cf. Fig. 2B) was constructed from the relative
location of the neuron within TRN relative to the borders
of the nucleus. When cutting the slices used for the
electrophysiological recordings, we carefully noted the
relative size and shape of specific landmarks (see above:
habenula, posterior commissure, fasiculus retroflexus) for
consistency of slices across animals. The cells dorsal/ventral
location within a given slice was accomplished by noting
the depth of the cell from the surface using the DIC optics
and the side of the slice from which the recording was being
obtained.
For glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) immunohistochemistry, Sprague–Dawley rats (postnatal age
15–19 days) were deeply anaesthetized with sodium
pentobarbital (60 mg kg−1 ) and transcardially perfused
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) followed
by 4% paraformaldehyde–0.5% gluteraldehyde in 0.1 m
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Brains were removed and postfixed overnight in paraformaldehyde. Brains were then
cryoprotected in a 30% sucrose in PBS and sectioned using
a cryostat (50 μm sections). Free-floating sections were
processed for GAD immunohistochemistry using GAD65
mouse monoclonal anti-GAD antibody (Developmental
Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). The
sections were washed in PBS (3 × 10 min), and incubated
in 0.5% H2 O2 (0.1% sodium azide) PBS for 30 min.
After repeated washes in PBS (3 × 5 min), sections were
incubated in 5% normal horse serum (NHS; Sigma)
for 60 min, then in anti-GAD antibody (1 : 50 in 1%
NHS) for 2 h at room temperature and overnight at 4◦ C.
After PBS rinses (3 × 10 min), sections were incubated
in the secondary antibody (peroxidase conjugated horse
anti-mouse IgG, 1 : 100, Vector Laboratories) for 1 h.
After four washes in 0.1 m PBS, sections were reacted
with 0.05% diaminobenzidine, 0.002% H2 O2 and 0.1%
nickel ammonium sulphate in 0.1 m PBS, then washed
and mounted on gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated and
coverslipped using permount mounting medium.

Data analyses

The apparent input resistances of the neurons were
calculated from the linear slope of the voltage–current
relationship obtained by applying constant current pulses
ranging from −100 to +40 pA (800 ms duration).
The firing properties of each TRN neuron were
examined at holding potentials near rest (−60 mV)
and at relatively hyperpolarized membrane potential
(approximately −80 mV) by applying depolarizing step
currents (1 s duration; 10–40 pA increments; 15 steps).

J Physiol 582.1

Smaller increment current steps (10–20 pA) were used
in the neurons having relatively high input resistances,
whereas larger increments (30–40 pA) were used in
neurons having relatively lower input resistances. The
amplitude of the low threshold spike (LTS) was calculated
as the difference of the peak amplitude of the transient
depolarization and the sustained tail amplitude of the
ohmic step. In order to test for the presence of the
low threshold transient calcium current (I T ), neurons
were recorded using voltage clamp techniques with
a holding potential of −50 mV. Command voltages
from −50 to −125 mV (5 mV increments, 16 steps, 1 s
duration) were subsequently applied and then stepped
back to the holding potential (−50 mV) in order to
evoke the transient inward current. The quantification of
action potential characteristics was made using pCLAMP
software (Molecular Devices, Inc.). Action potential
amplitudes were calculated as from baseline to peak, and
half-width durations were calculated as the duration of
the response at 50% maximum amplitude. All data are
presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical
analyses usually consisted of the Mann–Whitney U test,
and when appropriate, one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with the Tukey–Kramer multiple comparisons
test. The difference between means was considered
significant when P < 0.05.
Results
Diversity of firing modes of TRN neurons

Current dogma is that a ubiquitous characteristic of
thalamic neurons, including TRN neurons, is the ability to
produce burst discharge of action potentials. In this study,
we systematically examined the action potential discharge
properties of TRN neurons relative to their distribution
within TRN. Intracellular recordings were obtained from
a total of 211 TRN neurons and these cells were
subdivided by their action potential discharge
characteristics. Of these neurons 170 biocytin-containing
cells were recovered and then mapped as to their
localization within TRN. To confirm that all four
thalamic slices (dorsal to ventral slices, see Methods)
do indeed contain TRN, GAD-immunohistochemistry
was performed to localize GABA-positive regions
within each of the four slices (Fig. 1A). As expected,
GAD-immunoreactive neurons were found in all levels of
TRN slices, further supporting that electrophysiological
recordings obtained in this study were indeed restricted
to TRN. Furthermore, all neurons recorded were found
within the boundaries of TRN and the morphology of
these neurons is consistent with previous findings that
most TRN neurons have fusiform-shaped somata with
either bipolar or multipolar primary dendrites (Fig. 1B;
Spreafico et al. 1988; Cox et al. 1996).

Surprisingly, the majority of TRN neurons (56%:
71/127) obtained from dTRN (1st and 2nd slices)
did not produce burst discharge even from relatively
hyperpolarized membrane potentials of −80 mV
(Fig. 2Aa, Non-burst). In a smaller population of dTRN
neurons (35%: 44/127), the apparent burst discharge
consisted of an initial action potential followed by

illustrate three different subtypes of TRN
neurons based on their ability to produce burst
discharge: non-burst (left), atypical burst
(middle), and typical burst (right). The neurons
were manually hyperpolarized to membrane
potentials of −80 mV, and then depolarizing
current steps were used to evoke action
potential discharge. Non-burst neurons
responded to the current step with tonic action
potential discharge. Atypical burst neurons
characteristically had an initial normal action
potential followed by depolarizing potentials
with smaller amplitude and longer duration
than a typical action potential. Typical burst
neurons produced a high frequency, transient
action potential discharge in response to the
current step. At a depolarized holding potential
(−60 mV), all three neuron subtypes produced
tonic action potential discharge in response to
a depolarizing current pulse. b, in ventral TRN,

subtypes of TRN neurons; non-burst (left) and

potentials. Insets illustrate the initial action

that previously described in TRN and other thalamic

apparent difference in the transient discharge by the
typical burst and atypical burst neurons, we quantified
three different characteristics of action potentials in
these cells. Namely, we measured the amplitudes of the
first three action potentials, the half-width of the first
action potential, and the instantaneous firing frequency
of the first two action potential intervals (Table 1). The
amplitude of the 1st action potential in the burst did not
differ between atypical burst and typical burst neurons
(P > 0.2, one-way ANOVA with Tukey–Kramer multiple
comparisons test); however, the subsequent two action
potentials were significantly smaller in the atypical burst
neurons (P < 0.01, t test). The half-width of the initial
action potential was also significantly shorter in the
typical burst neurons compared to the atypical burst
and non-burst neurons (Tables 1, P < 0.001, one-way
ANOVA with Tukey–Kramer multiple comparisons test).
Throughout this study, long duration current pulses (1 s
duration) were used to evoke action potential discharge;
however, in many studies, shorter duration current steps
are used to produce burst discharge. In a subpopulation
of neurons, shorter current steps (30–50 ms) were used to
evoke burst discharge in order to assure that the differences
that we observed in the discharge properties of the TRN
neurons were not a result of the longer current steps.
As illustrated in Fig. 3A, the duration of current pulses
(50 ms versus 1 s) did not alter the discharge properties of
the different TRN neuron subtypes (n = 5 for each TRN
neuron subtype).
As expected, when the membrane potential was held at a
relatively depolarized level (> −60 mV), all TRN neurons
produced tonic action potential discharge indicating the
voltage dependence of the burst discharge, when present
(Fig. 2Aa). In contrast to dTRN, the majority of neurons
recorded from vTRN slices (3rd and 4th slices) displayed
typical burst discharge (82%: 69/84, Fig. 2Ab, Typical
burst). The remaining 18% (15/84) of the neurons in vTRN

slices were non-burst neurons (Fig. 2Ab, Non-burst);
however, it is interesting to note that seven of these
cells were located near the dorsal surface of the 3rd
slices, further supporting that non-burst neurons are
preferentially localized in dTRN (Fig. 2Ba, orange circles).
It is important to note that we found all three TRN
subtypes in slices from older animals as well (up to
postnatal age 28 days, Fig. 2Bb), suggesting that the
atypical and non-burst neurons are not simply an
immature state of typical burst neurons.
As illustrated in Fig. 2Ba, the distribution of 170 TRN
neurons has been mapped: 73 non-burst, 40 atypical
burst, and 57 typical burst neurons. The non-burst and
atypical burst neurons were almost exclusively localized
within the dTRN (slices 1 and 2: Fig. 2Ba).These neurons
do not appear to be differentially distributed across
the anterior/posterior extent of TRN. In contrast, the
vast majority of vTRN neurons showed stereotypical
burst discharge (Fig. 2Ba, Typical burst, blue circles).
Considering TRN neurons have been differentiated
by soma shape and polarity within TRN (Spreafico
et al. 1991), we also investigated whether these three
TRN neuron subtypes may be differentiated by their
morphology. The morphology of biocytin-filled neurons
was obtained for 73 TRN neurons: 32 non-burst, 16
atypical burst, and 25 typical burst neurons (e.g. Fig. 1B).
In these neurons the soma and dendritic arborizations
were well-labelled for further analyses. We analysed
the soma area, soma shape (ratio of the major and
minor axis), and number of primary dendrites (Table 2).
Although these basic morphological characteristics varied
within each group distinguished by discharge mode,
there were no significant differences in any of these
morphological characteristics amongst the three groups
(P > 0.1, one-way ANOVA). Thus, the size or shape of TRN
neurons was not a prediction as to whether the neuron
could produce burst discharge of action potentials.

TRN neurons

properties differed amongst these three TRN neuron
subtypes (Table 1). The resting membrane potential
significantly differed between burst and non-burst
neuronal subtypes (F 2,134 = 3.9, P < 0.001, one-way
ANOVA). The average membrane potential of non-burst
neurons (−66.5 ± 8.0 mV, n = 46) significantly differed
from the typical burst neurons (−70.0 ± 6.8 mV, n = 61,
P < 0.01, Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison test)
but did not significantly differ from atypical burst
neurons (−69.9 ± 4.7 mV, n = 30, P > 0.1). The apparent
input resistances of neurons also significantly varied
across the three neuronal populations (F 2,149 = 32.8,
P < 0.01, one-way ANOVA). Non-burst neurons had
an average input resistance of 421 ± 184 M (n = 60)
which was significantly different from atypical burst
neurons (330 ± 76 M , n = 30) and typical burst neurons
(226 ± 87 M , n = 62, P < 0.01, Tukey–Kramer multiple
comparison test). Furthermore, the input resistance of
atypical burst neurons was significantly higher than that of
typical burst neurons (P < 0.01, Tukey–Kramer multiple
comparison test).
Non-burst TRN neurons lack low threshold Ca2 +
current

Burst firing mode of thalamic neurons requires activation
of the low threshold, transient Ca2+ current, I T (Deschˆenes
et al. 1982; Jahnsen & Llin´as, 1984b; Coulter et al. 1989).
Considering the dependence of I T activation for burst
discharge, we speculate that non-burst neurons may in
fact lack I T . Alternatively, I T may be masked or inhibited
by other voltage-dependent conductances such as the
transient K+ current, I A . We initially examined
whether a low threshold, transient calcium-dependent
depolarization (low threshold spike: LTS) could be
evoked in these different TRN neuron subtypes. From
an initial membrane potential of −80 mV, depolarizing
current steps (1 s duration; 10–40 pA increments; 15
steps) were applied in normal ACSF and TTX. In
normal ACSF, we recorded from 26 non-burst neurons

in dTRN slices. In the presence of TTX (0.5 μm), the
depolarizing current step did not evoke a transient
depolarization in 10 of 26 neurons (Fig. 3B, Non-burst).
However, in the remaining 16 neurons a small amplitude,
transient depolarizing potential was evoked (e.g. see
Fig. 4B, Small depolarization). This depolarization
averaged 4.6 ± 3.1 mV (n = 16, range 2–10 mV), and was
significantly smaller than a normal LTS evoked in typical
burst neurons (P < 0.01, Mann–Whitney test). In control
conditions, typical burst neurons recorded from vTRN
slices produced clear burst discharge (Fig. 3B, Typical
burst). In TTX (0.5 μm), a stereotypical LTS was evoked
in all typical burst neurons with an average amplitude of
24.9 ± 5.8 mV (n = 16, Fig. 3B, Typical burst). Atypical
burst neurons also produced an LTS in the presence
of TTX. The LTS amplitude evoked in atypical burst
neurons was significantly greater than those in typical
burst neurons (Fig. 3B, Atypical burst; 30.6 ± 4.3 mV,
n = 16, P < 0.05, Mann–Whitney). In addition, the shape
of the LTS differed between typical burst and atypical
burst neurons. The duration of the LTS (measured
at 50% peak amplitude) in atypical burst neurons
averaged 48.2 ± 11.0 ms (n = 16) and was significantly
greater than typical burst neurons (34.1 ± 11.4 ms,
n = 16, P < 0.05, Mann–Whitney). In these neurons,
the atypical burst neurons had significantly higher
input resistances (404 ± 130 M ; n = 16) compared
to the typical burst neurons (205 ± 83 M ; P < 0.01,
Mann–Whitney); however, there was not a statistically
significant relationship between LTS amplitude and input
resistance.
In order to examine if non-burst TRN neurons lack the
low threshold, transient calcium current, I T , membrane
currents were recorded. Following conditioning
hyperpolarization voltage steps (−50 to −125 mV, 5 mV
increments, 1 s duration, Fig. 3Ca) a step command to
−50 mV was applied to evoke the low threshold transient
current, I T , while not activating high threshold Ca2+
currents. In non-burst TRN neurons that produced
no LTS in response to current steps in current clamp
mode (Fig. 3B, Non-burst), the voltage clamp protocol
did not produce any transient inward current in 6 of 7
neurons, suggesting a lack of I T (Fig. 3Cb, Non-burst).
In the remaining non-burst neuron, a very small

A, similar burst discharges are produced by both long- and short-duration current pulses. a, long-duration current
pulses (1 s duration) evoke characteristic discharges in TRN neuron subtypes similar to that in Fig. 2Ab. In the
same neurons, a shorter duration current pulse (50 ms duration) evokes a similar discharge as the one second
pulse in each subtype of TRN neuron. B, following the addition of TTX (0.5 μM), many non-burst neurons (right)

burst neurons. All neurons were manually hyperpolarized to membrane potentials of −80 mV (dashed line). Ca, the

Figure 4. The underlying effect of 4-AP on non-burst neurons
At a holding potential of −80 mV, a depolarizing step current injection in the presence of TTX produced either
no depolarizing potential (n = 6) or a transient depolarizing potential (n = 5) in non-burst neurons (n = 11). A, in
TRN neurons that produced no transient depolarization in TTX, 4-AP (5 mM) produced no unmasking of a transient
response in 3 of 6 neurons, but unmasked a small depolarization in the remaining 3 neurons (weak unmasking).
B, in non-burst neurons that produced small depolarizing potentials in TTX, 4-AP (5 mM) application increased the
small depolarization in all 5 neurons in a reversible manner. In 2 of 5 cells, 4-AP application unmasked a normal
appearing low threshold Ca2+ spike. Dashed line indicates −80 mV. The bottom traces (I) indicate depolarizing
current steps.

transient current (−87.3 pA) was evoked. In all typical
burst neurons tested, a transient inward current was
evoked and the peak amplitude of the current averaged
−630 ± 378 pA (n = 11; Fig. 3Cb, typical burst). The
peak inward current evoked in atypical burst neurons
did not significantly differ from typical burst neurons
(Fig. 3Cb, atypical burst; −654 ± 228 pA, n = 10, P > 0.1,
Mann–Whitney test). In order to verify the transient
inward current is indeed a Ca2+ current, we next tested
if the general Ca2+ channel blocker Ni2+ attenuated
the transient inward current. Bath application of Ni2+
(1.0–2.0 mm) completely attenuated the transient inward
current in all typical and atypical burst neurons tested
(n = 10, Fig. 3Cb).
Considering the similar activation characteristics of
the voltage-dependent outward K+ current, I A and I T ,

previous studies suggest that the lack of burst discharge
in dLGN interneurons may result from overlapping
activation of these two currents (Pape et al. 1994). We next
tested if the transient K+ current, I A , could mask or prevent
an LTS in non-burst TRN neurons. In order to test this,
recordings were obtained from 11 non-burst TRN neurons
that produced either no transient depolarization (n = 6)
or a small amplitude transient depolarization (< 5 mV,
n = 5) in response to depolarizing current steps (1 s,
10–40 pA increments, 15 steps) in TTX (0.5 μm, Fig. 4).
The I A antagonist 4-aminopoyridine (4-AP, 0.05–5 mm)
was then bath applied and the subsequent effect on the
response to depolarizing current pulses was examined. In
six neurons with no transient depolarization, the addition
of 4-AP had no effect on the transient depolarizations
in three neurons (Fig. 4A, No unmasking). In the

voltage protocol to isolate IT with depolarization to −50 mV from different holding potentials (−50 to −125 mV;
5 mV increments; 1 s duration). b, the current traces were obtained in the interval indicated as the grey bar in a.
In TTX, IT was not detected in non-burst TRN neurons (6 of 7 neurons tested). However, a typical IT was evoked
in all typical burst neurons tested. The IT evoked in atypical burst neurons appeared qualitatively similar to those
in typical burst neurons. In order to verify that IT in these neurons are indeed a Ca2+ -dependent current, we
next tested the sensitivity of the IT to the Ca2+ channel blocker, nickel. Bath application of nickel (1.0–2.0 mM)
completely attenuated IT in all typical and atypical burst neurons tested. In non-burst TRN neurons, nickel produced
no changes in current responses.

remaining three neurons, a small depolarizing potential
was unmasked in the presence of 4-AP suggesting that
there may be a very small Ca2+ -dependant current in
a subgroup of non-burst TRN neurons (Fig. 4A, Weak
unmasking). In the remaining five neurons, small transient
depolarizations (< 5 mV) were evoked by the depolarizing
current steps in the presence of TTX (Fig. 4B, Small
depolarization). Following the addition of 4-AP, larger
amplitude transient depolarizations (range 10–25 mV)
were unmasked in all five neurons tested (Fig. 4B,
Small depolarization). In two of these cells, a nearly
normal looking LTS was unmasked in 4-AP (Fig. 4B,
Strong unmasking). In the other three neurons, a larger
transient depolarizing potential was unmasked in 4-AP
(Fig. 4B, Weak unmasking).
Next, we examined whether the blockade of I A with
4-AP could transform non-burst neurons into burst
neurons because the blockade of I A with 4-AP unmasks
an apparent LTS in a small population of non-burst
neurons. Small depolarizing steps (1 s duration, 10–40 pA
increments, 15 steps) were applied to non-burst TRN
neurons without TTX in order to evoke action potential
discharge (Fig. 5, Non-burst). In these experiments
the ionotropic glutamate receptors antagonists DNQX
(20 μm) and CPP (10 μm) were included in the bath to
attenuate 4-AP induced epileptiform discharges. In seven
non-burst neurons held at hyperpolarized membrane
potentials (−80 mV), the depolarizing current steps
only produced tonic action potential discharge (Fig. 5,
Non-burst). Following the addition of 4-AP (0.5 mm),
these neurons still produced tonic discharge (Fig. 5,
Non-burst; 4-AP), suggesting that the unmasked LTS
observed in some non-burst neurons is not sufficient to
evoke burst firing. We also examined whether blocking I A
in typical burst and atypical burst neurons could affect
their burst firing properties. In all five typical burst TRN
neurons, the depolarizing current steps produced burst
discharge (Fig. 5, Typical burst). Following the addition

J Physiol 582.1

of 4-AP, the burst discharge of these cells remained.
There was a small decrease in the amplitude of the 2nd
action potential within the burst (pre: 95.4 ± 7.2 mV,
4-AP: 86.4 ± 8.2 mV, n = 5, P > 0.1, Wilcoxon matched
pairs test) but it was not significantly different as with
atypical burst neurons. In a similar manner, the addition
of 4-AP did not alter the general features of the atypical
burst neuron discharge. In control conditions, in response
to a depolarizing current step, the atypical burst neurons
produced a discharge consisting of an initial short duration
action potential followed by a couple of broader transient
depolarizations (Fig. 5, Atypical burst). In 4-AP, the
discharge had a similar shape as control conditions;
however, the last transient depolarization was longer in
duration (Fig. 5, Atypical burst inset, arrow). This latter
depolarization was produced in 4 of 5 neurons, and was
insensitive to TTX, suggesting this response probably
results from activation of a high threshold calcium current,
such as an L-current.
Discussion
In the present study, we found that TRN neurons can
be easily differentiated into three subtypes based on
their firing discharge mode: non-burst, atypical burst
and typical burst neurons. These neuronal subtypes also
have other distinguishing intrinsic properties such as
resting membrane potential and input resistance. TRN
neurons have previously been differentiated by their
distinct morphology (Scheibel & Scheibel, 1966; Spreafico
et al. 1988; Avanzini et al. 1989; Spreafico et al. 1991);
however, the differences in intrinsic properties that we
observed were not associated with distinct morphologies.
Perhaps the most intriguing feature of these TRN
neuron subtypes is that they are differentially distributed
within TRN. Non-burst and atypical burst neurons were
predominantly located within the dorsal TRN, whereas
typical burst neurons were predominantly localized to
Figure 5. Blocking I A does not alter action
potential discharge properties of non-burst and
typical burst TRN neurons
Typical burst: in this neuron, the depolarizing current
step produces clear burst discharge ring atop an LTS. In
the presence of 4-AP (0.5 mM), the burst discharge
persists. Atypical burst: in this neuron, the depolarizing
current step produces the atypical burst discharge
consisting of an initial sharp action potential followed
by broader transient depolarizations (see inset). In 4-AP,
a similar discharge pattern is observed; however, the last
transient depolarization (arrow in inset) has a longer
duration. Non-burst: from a membrane potential of
−80 mV, depolarizing current steps in control solution
produced no burst discharge in this neuron. In the
presence of 4-AP, the depolarizing current step still
produces only tonic discharge with a shorter latency to
the first action potential. Inset scale: 20 mV, 20 ms.

the ventral TRN region. These two novel TRN neuron
subtypes, non-burst and atypical burst neurons, were
present at all ages tested (postnatal ages: 10–28 days)
indicating that the lack of burst firing is not age dependent
in the range tested. The absence of burst discharge in
non-burst neurons results from the lack or minimal
amount of I T in these cells as indicated from the present
data. Burst discharge of TRN neurons has long been
considered a ubiquitous characteristic of TRN neurons
as well as an important component contributing to
intrathalamic rhythmic activities associated with different
levels of arousal and certain pathophysiological conditions
such as absence epilepsy (Glenn & Steriade, 1982; Jahnsen
& Llin´as, 1984a; Coulter et al. 1989; Steriade et al. 1993;
von Krosigk et al. 1993). The functional significance
of these different distinct firing patterns among
TRN neuronal subtypes (non-burst, atypical burst) to
intrathalamic rhythmic activities as well as overall function
of thalamocortical circuits remains unclear. Interestingly,
the non-burst neurons were localized in the dTRN, a region
predominantly associated with the visual system and thus
may serve a unique role for visual processing (Jones, 1975;
Hale et al. 1982; French et al. 1985; Shosaku et al. 1989;
Pinault et al. 1995a; Coleman & Mitrofanis, 1996).

Ubiquitous burst discharge of TRN neurons?

Burst discharge has been considered a ubiquitous feature
of virtually all thalamic neurons including TRN neurons.
Almost all studies involving TRN and perigeniculate
nucleus (PGN, analogous to visual TRN in higher
animals such as ferrets, cats, monkeys and humans)
indicate that these neurons can produce a transient,
high frequency action potential discharge (Sefton &
Burke, 1966; Sumitomo et al. 1976; Dubin & Cleland,
1977; Hale et al. 1982; Kayama et al. 1982; Kayama
et al. 1986; Steriade & Llin´as, 1988; Amzica et al.
1992). The burst discharge of TRN neurons results
from activation of the voltage-dependent, low threshold,
transient calcium current, I T , which in turn produces a
transient depolarization on top of which a high frequency
discharge of sodium-dependent action potentials can
occur (Ahls´en & Lindstr¨om, 1982; Steriade & Llin´as, 1988;
Amzica et al. 1992; Huguenard & Prince, 1992; von Krosigk
et al. 1993; Bal et al. 1995). To date, there are two reports in
the literature indicating a lack of burst discharge in TRN
neurons, one in vivo and one in vitro study: however, these
neurons were a small fraction of the population, and thus
the localization and morphology of these neurons were
not systematically studied (Contreras et al. 1992; Brunton
& Charpak, 1997). Furthermore, the cellular mechanisms
underlying the lack of burst discharge were not examined.
In the present study, we found two distinct types of TRN
neurons that do not produce stereotypical burst output:

non-burst and atypical burst neurons. Following blockade
of action potentials with TTX, atypical burst neurons
appear to produce a voltage-dependent LTS in response
to a depolarizing current step with larger amplitude and
longer duration than that in typical burst neurons. In
addition, the burst discharge of atypical burst neurons
differs in that the action potentials riding atop the LTS
have lower amplitude and longer duration than the initial
normal-appearing action potential (e.g. see Fig. 2). The
decreased amplitude of the apparent action potentials
may result from Na+ channel inactivation considering
the significantly greater input resistance of atypical burst
neurons compared to typical burst neurons.
In contrast, non-burst neurons appear to be a mixed
population of neurons regarding the presence of a low
threshold calcium current. In control conditions, these
cells only produce tonic discharge, and no burst discharge.
In the presence of TTX, and from a hyperpolarized
membrane potential, approximately half of the neurons
produce no transient depolarizations in response to
depolarizing current step injections, suggesting the lack of
I T . In the remaining neurons, there is a small amplitude,
transient depolarization reminiscent of a truncated I T ,
but obviously insufficient to produce burst discharge. If
we then add the K+ -channel blocker 4-AP to non-burst
neurons that have a small transient depolarization, we
unmask a larger amplitude transient depolarization that
resembles an LTS. Thus, it appears that a subpopulation
of non-burst TRN neurons do indeed have some I T , but
as a result of overlapping activation characteristics of
the voltage-dependent, transient K+ current, I A and I T ,
activation of I A occludes the transient LTS needed for burst
discharge; however, the unmasked LTS in these non-burst
neurons is not sufficient to evoke burst firing (Fig. 5,
Non-burst). The functional role of this smaller transient
depolarization may be to modulate integration of afferent
synaptic input, and thus in certain conditions in which
I A may be modulated or attenuated, afferent information
processing could be influenced by I T .
Functional significance of the heterogeneous TRN
neuron subtypes

The functional role of these different TRN neuronal
subtypes remains unclear. Perhaps the best insight may
be due to the non-uniform distribution of these different
neuronal subtypes. Non-burst and atypical burst neurons
are preferentially localized within the dorsal TRN, whereas
the typical burst neurons are primarily located in the
ventral TRN. The TRN can be subdivided into different
modality specific regions and the dorsal TRN is primarily
associated with visual information processing (Jones,
1975; Crabtree & Killackey, 1989; Pinault et al. 1995a;
Coleman & Mitrofanis, 1996). In rodents, the dorsal
TRN primarily innervates the dLGN and the higher order

206

S.-H. Lee and others

visual thalamic nucleus, the lateral posterior nucleus, both
structures that are related to visual processing (Coleman
& Mitrofanis, 1996). It will be of considerable interest to
determine if these multiple TRN subtypes are localized
within the visual regions of TRN in other species.
Interestingly, various studies have investigated the
prevalence of burst discharge during different levels
of arousal. It is generally accepted that during
periods of drowsiness, slow-wave sleep, and certain
pathophysiological conditions, the intrathalamic circuit
can produce rhythmic activities that are dependent on
burst output of TRN and associated thalamocortical
relay neurons. Neuromodulators that have been shown
to decrease the burst output of either neuronal population
also attenuate the rhythmic activity. Furthermore, burst
discharge of thalamocortical neurons has also been
observed in the wake animal as well, but to a much
lesser extent (Guido & Weyand, 1995; Ramcharan et al.
2000; Edeline et al. 2000; Fanselow et al. 2001; Massaux
et al. 2004). A critical component of thalamocortical
burst discharge is a preburst hyperpolarization of the
thalamocortical neuron, which is typically thought to
be in response to a strong inhibition produced by TRN
neurons, possibly burst discharge of these TRN cells. From
various in vivo studies, it appears that burst frequency in
LGN neurons is significantly less than that observed in
other sensory modalities including both somatosensory
and auditory systems (Guido & Weyand, 1995; Edeline
et al. 2000; Ramcharan et al. 2000; Fanselow et al. 2001;
Weyand et al. 2001; Massaux et al. 2004; Ramcharan et al.
2005). Perhaps this decreased frequency is a direct result of
the significantly decreased numbers of TRN neurons that
can produce burst discharge that innervate the dLGN as
suggested by this study.
Another important issue regarding these different
neuronal subtypes is the actual inhibitory influence
on the postsynaptic neurons. In paired recordings of
synaptically coupled PGN and LGN relay neurons, tonic
discharge of the PGN neuron activates short-lasting
GABAA receptor mediated activity in the thalamocortical
neuron, whereas burst discharge of the PGN neuron
produces a longer-lasting hyperpolarization via activation
of GABAB receptors (Kim et al. 1997). While the firing
properties of the cell clearly influence the postsynaptic
neuron, the actual axonal arborization and number
of synaptic contacts can also significantly influence
the coupling strength between the presynaptic and
postsynaptic neuron. In the rodent somatosensory
thalamus, TRN neurons can give rise to a variety of
axonal arbors ranging from very focal, high density of
putative release sites to very widespread, low density
arbors (Scheibel & Scheibel, 1966; Yen et al. 1985; Pinault
et al. 1995b; Cox et al. 1996). From paired recordings in
the somatosensory region, the strength of postsynaptic
inhibition is positively correlated with the density of the

J Physiol 582.1

axonal arbor (Cox et al. 1997a). It will be interesting
to determine how the different TRN subtypes influence the
postsynaptic neuron. Do the different firing characteristics
described here give rise to distinct postsynaptic outputs?
Secondly, do the axonal arbors of these distinct TRN
subtypes differ as well? Reconstruction of the axonal
arbors will be required to address the latter issue. Of
particular interest would be the atypical burst neurons.
Clearly, the amplitude and duration of action potentials
in these neurons differ significantly from typical burst
neurons, but does this translate to a difference in the
axonal output of these cells? Furthermore, it will be
important to examine whether non-burst neurons provide
weak inhibitory influences onto relay neurons, or perhaps
because they lack the bursting mode, these cells respond
to afferent synaptic transmission in a more linear manner
than cells that can burst.
Our study clearly indicates electrophysiological
heterogeneity amongst TRN neurons that is related to
their dorsal/ventral location within the TRN. Considering
that discrete regions of TRN have been associated with
specific sensory modalities (Jones, 1975), we speculate
that each sensory sector of the TRN may consist of
multiple TRN subtypes. The functional role of these
different TRN subtypes on thalamocortical information
processing remains open-ended for future investigation.

Sleep spindles arise from the interaction of thalamic and cortical neurons. Neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) inhibit
thalamocortical neurons, which in turn excite the TRN and cortical neurons. A fundamental principle of anatomical organization
of the thalamocortical projections is the presence of two pathways: the diffuse matrix pathway and the spatially selective core
pathway. Cortical layers are differentially targeted by these two pathways with matrix projections synapsing in superficial layers
and core projections impinging on middle layers. Based on this anatomical observation, we propose that spindles can be classified
into two classes, those arising from the core pathway and those arising from the matrix pathway, although this does not exclude the
fact that some spindles might combine both pathways at the same time. We find evidence for this hypothesis in EEG/MEG studies,
intracranial recordings, and computational models that incorporate this difference. This distinction will prove useful in accounting
for the multiple functions attributed to spindles, in that spindles of different types might act on local and widespread spatial scales.
Because spindle mechanisms are often hijacked in epilepsy and schizophrenia, the classification proposed in this review might
provide valuable information in defining which pathways have gone awry in these neurological disorders.

1. Introduction
Sleep spindles are characteristic oscillatory events that mark
intermediate and deep stages of nonrapid eye movement
(NREM) sleep. They arise from the background electroencephalogram (EEG) as oscillations of 0.5–3 s duration with
a fundamental frequency between 9 and 16 Hz and reoccur
with a rhythmicity of tens of seconds [1, 2]. Spindles have
been implicated in multiple functions, from maintenance of
sleep depth [3–5] to supporting neural plasticity [6, 7]. These
putative mechanisms are thought to underlie the strong link
between spindle activity and memory consolidation [8–11].
Spindles are generated within a well-understood circuitry
in which the thalamocortical (ThCx) connections play a
central role: excitatory ThCx neurons, entrained by inhibitory
neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), drive
cortical neurons [12–14]. Spindle properties in the time and
frequency domains are therefore highly dependent on the

thalamic generators and ThCx pathways, although this view
does not diminish the role that corticothalamic (CxTh) feedback has in shaping the spatiotemporal evolution of spindle
activity [15].
At the cortical level, spindles appear to be heterogeneous.
One of the most prominent aspects is the difference between
faster and slower spindles, depending on the dominant
frequency of each spindle oscillation [16–18]. Faster spindles
are usually observed in parietal regions, while slower spindles
are found in the frontal regions [19–21], although there is
considerable overlap in the EEG topography and in the frequency domain between these two extremes [22]. Intracranial
recordings in patients with refractory epilepsy that afford
higher spatial resolution might provide a solution to this
issue. However, two studies leveraging intracranial EEG
(iEEG) reported contradictory findings of whether spindle
frequency changes linearly as a function of the anteriorposterior axis [23] or whether there exists a discontinuity

2
around the premotor cortex [24]. The presence of a fundamental frequency for each spindle is made murkier by the
observation that some spindles show general slowing during
their duration [24], probably due to CxTh feedback.
Another major characteristic that differentiates cortical
spindles is the degree to which they involve different cortical
areas. Studies in both animal models and humans have
described spindles as being highly synchronized between
multiple cortical regions [14, 15, 25, 26], while more recent
findings in patients with iEEG have challenged this interpretation by demonstrating that spindles are isolated events [24,
27–29]. Studies supporting the former or the latter point of
view have relied, in most cases, on different recording methods, leaving open the question of whether the recording techniques might favor one or the other interpretation. In fact,
very few studies have compared directly the spatial extent of
local and widespread spindles [30, 31].
Crucially, the mechanisms which are responsible for the
emergence of local or widespread spindles are unresolved.
Two contrasting views suggest that spindle synchronization
might occur at the thalamic level, with minimal cortical contribution [34] or as a result of corticocortical (CxCx) interactions [15, 35]. We wondered whether this heterogeneity could
be explained in terms of the anatomical differences in the
pathways involved in spindle generation.

2. Mechanisms of Spindle Generation
The players involved in the generation of spindles have
been well characterized thanks to pioneering work in animal
studies [12–14]. The major generators are located in the
thalamus reflecting in part the reciprocal connections of
inhibitory neurons involving TRN and ThCx cells [36–38].
The TRN is a thin envelope of ∼1 mm width which encapsulates the frontocaudal length of the thalamus. Neurons in
the TRN project, via inhibitory GABA connections, to the
major excitatory thalamic nuclei, and most of them express
the Ca2+-binding protein parvalbumin [2]. As sleep depth
progresses, these neurons begin to fire in bursts, generating
massive inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in ThCx neurons
[26, 39]. Through deinactivation of the low-threshold Ca2+
channels, ThCx neurons in turn exhibit rebound burst firing
which activate the TRN neurons. Interestingly, the TRN is
organized in partially overlapping networks which project to
specific ThCx neurons [40]. As the thalamus is structured in
well-defined nuclei with multiple ThCx pathways, activity in
specific TRN subregions can entrain the spindle oscillation
in specific cortical areas by driving the corresponding ThCx
relay neurons.
Projections from ThCx neurons terminate in two areas:
the TRN, where the thalamic loop maintains the balance
between excitation and inhibitions of these two groups of
neurons, and the cortical regions, where they generate spindle
oscillations in cortical field potentials [41]. These cortical
potentials can be measured on the scalp and are routinely
recorded with EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in
humans, where the mechanisms underlying spindle generation are thought to mirror those described in animal studies
[2].

Neural Plasticity
The specific contributions of ThCx drive and CxTh feedback to the generation of spindles have been heavily debated
[41]. While thalamic regions are sufficient for the emergence
of spindle oscillations, as demonstrated by decortication in
vivo [38, 42] and recordings in thalamic slices [43], there is
strong evidence that the cortex plays a central role in spindle
organization [12, 44, 45]. At the minimum, the neocortex
can be described as an amplifier of thalamic oscillations
[46]. Accumulating evidence indicates that the cortex directly
affects the spatial and temporal synchronization of spindle
oscillations [12]. In the temporal domain, spindle initiation is
associated with a specific phase of the slow waves, which are
predominantly cortical events [21, 47, 48]. Furthermore, slow
waves triggered by purely cortical stimulation might favor the
emergence of spindles during their up state [49]. Conversely,
CxCx interaction and cortical feedback can accelerate spindle
termination [50].
In summary, while the TRN plays the central role of pacemaker in the generation of the spindle oscillation, the reciprocal connections between excitatory and inhibitory neurons
in the thalamus and between the ThCx and CxTh neurons are
essential in defining the spatiotemporal dynamics of spindle
activity. However, the classical description of spindle generation glosses over the issue of spatial extent and leaves unexplained the causes for the heterogeneity in spindle activity. We
propose that these issues can be resolved by adding the spatial
characteristics of the ThCx projections to the classical model
of spindle generation. Therefore, we need to turn our attention to these pathways and how they affect the spatial extent of
spindle oscillations.

3. Core and Matrix Pathways
Because of the central role of the thalamus in spindle
generation and its synchronization, the electrophysiological
properties and connectivity patterns of the thalamic nuclei
have a strong influence on the spindle properties. With the
exception of the TRN, which targets other thalamic nuclei,
the thalamus is composed of neurons that project to cortical
and subcortical areas [51]. ThCx neurons can be classified
based on the cortical target of their projections. Two major
pathways have been identified: the core (also called C-type)
pathway and the matrix (also called M-type) pathway (Figure 1) [32, 52]. These two pathways differ in a number of ways
[33]. Core neurons are spatially selective and topographically
organized, target a single cortical area, and project mostly to
the granular layer, the major input layer of the cortex. Matrix
neurons have diffuse, multiarea projections, characterized by
multiple distant arbors, and reach mostly superficial layers
of the cortex. The distribution of core and matrix neurons
is not uniform across thalamic nuclei: nuclei most strongly
associated with sensory relay, such as the lateral geniculate
body, are dominated by core neurons, while some other
nuclei lack those neurons completely [32, 53]. Although
tracing techniques have been essential in identifying these
two pathways, there are still unresolved issues regarding the
connections within and between thalamic nuclei. In particular, it is not clear whether core and matrix neurons have
direct, reciprocal connections and whether TRN neurons
project more strongly to either of the two neuron types.

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the core and matrix pathways. Spindles are generated in the reciprocal connections between
TRN (thalamic reticular nucleus, in gray) and the thalamocortical
neurons, belonging to either the core (in blue, labeled with “C”) or
the matrix (in red, labeled with “M”) pathway. Neurons belonging
to the core and matrix pathways are mostly intermixed inside the
thalamus, but individual nuclei might have prevalence of either type.
The projections from the TRN are inhibitory, indicated by the square
terminals. The core pathways are independent of each other, project
to a single brain area, and reach the middle, granular layers of the
cortical column. The matrix pathways have a broader and more
diffuse fan-out and target more superficial, supragranular layers.

Based on their anatomical connections, these two pathways have been assigned specific functional roles in the
thalamocortical dialogue. Core projections are those usually
associated with relay neurons, which transmit sensory information to cortical areas. These are the most intensively studied type of thalamic neuron. The matrix neurons, on the other
hand, are thought to maintain the overall state of the cortex, to
drive the internal excitability of large cortical regions, and to
control and time their propensity to respond to inputs [54].
Conversely, these thalamic neurons are affected by a strong
CxTh feedback [52]. The two ThCx pathways reflect the dual
nature of the thalamus as a whole, which integrates two different roles. The first role is the one in which sensory information is passed through relatively faithfully to cortical regions,
albeit amplified or suppressed based on attentional mechanisms. The second role is to maintain the state of the cortex
and to support an appropriate degree of activation, in either
wakefulness or sleep.

4. Core and Matrix Spindles
The importance of the thalamus and ThCx connections
in entraining the emergence of cortical spindles and the
major organizational principle of the ThCx pathways, which
subdivides them in core and matrix projections, provide
grounding for the hypothesis that spindles that occur in
either the core or the matrix neurons will differ based on the

anatomical characteristics of these two pathways. According
to this hypothesis, spindles that arise from the interaction
of TRN and core neurons will have a highly specific and
local cortical profile, while spindles that arise from the
interaction of TRN and matrix neurons will have more
diffuse and spatially synchronized cortical distribution. An
important aspect of this hypothesis is that the two types of
spindles will differ in virtue only of the cortical terminations
of the core and matrix ThCx neurons and not because of
any electrophysiological difference, such as firing rate or
firing threshold, of these neuronal populations. Therefore,
recordings in the decorticated thalamus will not be able to
distinguish these two types of spindles; differences will only
emerge at the cortical level. This interpretation dovetails with
the underlying assumption that both neuron types are equally
likely to generate spindles, as, to the best of our knowledge,
there is no evidence showing that one of the two neuronal
types is more or less involved in spindle activity.
The fundamental idea is that the characteristics of the
underlying ThCx pathways will have a corresponding effect
on the characteristics of the cortical spindles. This interpretation has clear and testable predictions that have only partially
been explored (Figure 2). As the core and matrix pathways
differ in cortical extent, we expect that there could be the two
types of spindles which have more local or more widespread
synchronization profiles. Because these two pathways target
separate cortical layers, we expect that core spindles will be
more prominent in granular layers and that matrix spindles
will be more prominent in superficial layers. As core pathways
dominate in primary sensory areas, we expect to observe
more local and spatially limited spindles in the postcentral,
occipital, and posterior temporal regions.
Although they are useful in conceptualizing the major
differences between core and matrix spindles and in guiding
research investigations, these predictions should not be taken
as absolute. There are a few qualifications based on known
anatomical and electrophysiological properties that should
be made explicit. The first aspect is that the core and matrix
spindles should not be considered as mutually exclusive.
It is easily conceivable that a few cycles within a spindle
might be generated in one or multiple core pathways before
activation of the matrix pathway, so that a spindle might
have highly local characteristics in the first cycles and more
widespread synchronization later. In fact, we expect that
the majority of spindles will consist of a mixture of core
and matrix properties at different stages of their temporal
evolution. The second aspect is that some matrix pathways
can be very localized, such as M-type neurons that have been
further divided in local and multiareal M-type neurons [53].
These local matrix neurons target superficial layers, like the
multiareal neurons, but their arborization is very limited,
consisting of single or few arbors reaching a single area,
similarly to core neurons. This finding blurs the distinction
between core and matrix neurons but does not affect the
underlying hypothesis that the anatomical connections of
the ThCx pathways will affect the dynamic properties of the
cortical spindles.
The third qualification is that although the ThCx connections play a central role in shaping spindle characteristics,

Figure 2: Predictions of the hypothesis that spindles can be classified in core or matrix spindles, depending on the ThCx pathways
involved in their generation. In addition to these two extreme types,
we expect that most spindles will have mixed properties of either
spindle type. (a) The first prediction of this hypothesis is that core
spindles are limited to single cortical regions, while one matrix
spindle affects multiple brain regions simultaneously. We expect to
observe independent core spindles in multiple regions, while matrix
spindles are not strictly limited by the boundaries of the cortical
regions. (b) The second prediction is that the laminar distribution
differs between core and matrix spindles. Core spindles are expected
to be most prevalent in granular layers, which receive ThCx afferents
from thalamic relay neurons, while activity of matrix spindles is
largest in superficial layers and in layers receiving diffuse thalamic
input. Mixed spindles should have spindle activity in all the layers or
show a temporal evolution from spindle activity being dominant in
some layers in the first cycles and in other layers in later cycles. (c) As
core ThCx pathways tend to arise from relay thalamic nuclei [32, 33],
we expect to find most core spindles in primary sensory and motor
cortices. Neurons projecting to the matrix ThCx pathways, on the
other hand, are more diffuse throughout the thalamus, suggesting
that matrix spindles might occur in most cortical regions.

the CxTh feedback is essential in determining spindles’
synchronization properties [15] and spatiotemporal evolution
[35]. Cortical activity propagates to the thalamus, especially
its relay nuclei, through two pathways: one modulatory
CxTh input from cortical layer VI and one tightly localized
input from cortical layer V [55, 56]. This CxTh activity in
turn projects back to other parts of the cortex, representing
therefore a thalamic pathway for CxCx interaction [57].
Accordingly, the CxTh modulation provided by these two
pathways might induce stronger CxCx coherence of spindles,
especially for those arising from the core ThCx projections,
and might represent a complimentary mechanism of spindle
synchronization, in addition to the core and matrix ThCx
connections.
Based on the premise that the anatomical substrate of the
ThCx projections affects the spatial characteristics of spindles, we propose that spindles whose activity is influenced by
matrix or core pathways will differ in terms of spatial extent
and, more generally, of spatiotemporal evolution. We will

examine the differences between these two types of spindles
in an explicit computational model, in laminar recordings in
animals, and in human studies combining EEG and MEG.
4.1. Computational Model. A highly constrained computational model of these two types of spindles can improve our
understanding of the specific predictions that derive from
the hypothesis. The ThCx circuitry involved in the spindle
generation has been well described and therefore it presents
a valuable case for the development of computational models
that replicate the essential features of spindle activity. Multiple computational models of the ThCx and CxTh role in spindle activity have been developed [12, 50, 58–60]. One model
has incorporated the two types of pathways in the generation
of spindle and has modeled the expected differences between
core and matrix spindles [61].
As in previous work, spindle generation was initiated by
the reciprocal connections between inhibitory TRN neurons
and excitatory ThCx neurons. Excitatory ThCx neurons were
modeled as either core or matrix whose properties were identical except that the neurons belonging to the matrix pathway
had up to five times wider fan-out of the cortical projections
than those belonging to the core pathway, in accord with
previous anatomical descriptions of the primate ThCx connections [62].
Bonjean et al. [61] found that the initial cycles were similar
in the core and matrix pathways but the spatial propagation
became more synchronous in the matrix pathway than in
the core pathway as the spindle unfolded. The termination process was also different in the two pathways: core
spindles decayed asynchronously across multiple locations,
while matrix spindles had a temporally defined offset. This
effect was in part due to the CxTh feedback projections that
influence the matrix neurons more than the core neurons [50,
63]. A crucial observation was that the spindles often involved
both pathways: spindles which were generated in the core
pathway were more likely to spread to the matrix pathway
after a few hundred ms than to the opposite direction.
By explicitly modeling the assumptions underlying the
hypothesis presented here, this work confirms the prediction
that the cortical fan-out of the two pathways can affect the
spatial extent of the synchronization of core and matrix spindles. It also provides a framework for the dynamic interaction
between these two pathways, often within the same spindles,
where the first cycles might involve only one of the two pathways and where the termination might or might not involve
CxTh feedback.
4.2. Laminar Profiles. Based on the laminar projections of the
core and matrix pathways, we expect that the two types of
spindles can be dissociated based on the cortical layers that
show the largest activity. The thalamocortical core pathway
terminates mostly on the granular layer, while the matrix
pathway targets more superficial layers. These predictions
have not been explicitly tested to the best of our knowledge.
Two classical studies have investigated spindle oscillations using laminar probes and their results might shed
some light on this distinction [46, 64]. Both of these studies
reported two types of spindles, although this distinction was

Neural Plasticity
not framed in terms of core/matrix spindles. The major observation of Kandel and Buzs´aki [46] is that spindles differ in the
location of the sources and of the sinks across cortical layers.
The more commonly observed spindles had sinks in layer IV,
while they reported other spindles that had a more superficial
profile. Intriguingly, both studies find that spindles might
have either of the two laminar profiles, or more often a single
spindle oscillation might evolve from one type to the other.
These classical laminar studies support several aspects of
the hypothesis presented in this review. The first aspect is the
usefulness of using laminar profiles to classify spindles in two
major groups. The second aspect is that while some spindles
have largest sinks in the granular layer IV, other spindles have
significant activity in superficial layers. Thirdly, these studies
indicate that most spindles consist of a mixture of the two
spindle types. Considering the ability of laminar recordings
to identify spindle types, further studies employing this technique will be useful in investigating the temporal evolution of
spindle oscillations across cortical layers and between spindle
types.
4.3. EEG versus MEG. The distinction between core and
matrix is particularly useful in explaining the intriguing
observation that while spindles observed on scalp EEG
have high interregional coherence, spindles measured with
MEG showed high variability across cortical areas, with
asynchronous phase and amplitude across sensors and with
poor correlation to the simultaneously recorded EEG [30,
65]. Multiple measures supported this conclusion. Coherence
between pairs of EEG electrodes during spindle activity was
0.7, while coherence between pairs of MEG sensors was 0.3.
Spindles in the MEG were spatially much more variable.
Techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), can
be used to summarize the amount of variance inherent in
the recordings during sleep. 50% of the variance in the EEG
spindle recordings was explained by two principal components, indicating that the signal was relatively simple. On the
other hand, to account for the same variance, more than 15
PCA components were necessary for the MEG spindle signal
[65]. Correspondingly, the estimated sources vary between
the two recording techniques: while sources computed from
spindle recordings in the EEG were widely distributed and
synchronous across the cortex, sources computed from the
MEG signal were highly specific, with the phase of oscillation
varying between multiple locations. In contrast to the EEG
source analysis, MEG source estimates indicate that sleep
spindles are generated by multiple brain regions relatively
independently [30, 66].
These observations are in agreement with recordings that
combined scalp EEG with iEEG. The spindles observed in the
EEG were poorly synchronized with spindles captured with
depth electrodes, suggesting that possibly different mechanisms are involved in the generation of spindles appearing in
one or the other recording system [28].
These results integrate well with the framework where
MEG is more sensitive to core spindles and EEG spindles
might pick up better the matrix spindles that occur mostly in
superficial cortical layers. This might be the result of biophysical differences in the orientation of the cortical neurons that

5
are entrained in the spindle frequency, as the magnetic signal
is highly dependent on the orientation of the dipole source
[67]. This interpretation would also explain the small delay
observed between EEG and MEG [68]; we can interpret this
as spindle starts as core and then becomes matrix thanks to
CxTh feedback.
Current EEG/MEG studies do not provide unequivocal
evidence supporting the prediction that core spindles might
occur more likely over primary sensory areas, while matrix
spindles might favor associative areas. The identification of
possible differences in the cortical distribution of the different
types of spindles is complicated by the very low spatial
coherence of MEG spindles, which results in multiple, sparse
sources [30, 66]. Nevertheless, a pattern seems to emerge
in which MEG spindles are mostly localized over precentral
areas including primary motor cortex and postcentral areas
of the parietal cortex of each hemisphere [66]. On the other
hand, a similar study was not able to unequivocally identify
the distinctive generators of EEG and MEG spindles [30]. In
addition, significant functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) activity associated with EEG spindles was observed in
paralimbic areas, in prefrontal regions, and also in the vicinity
of auditory cortices, in addition to the thalamus [69]. Overall,
this lack of a substantial difference in cortical distribution
between EEG and MEG spindles in the literature calls for
further studies necessary to test the prediction of differential
cortical areas involved in core and matrix spindles.

5. Outstanding Questions
The experimental observations described above provide
some supporting evidence for the hypothesis that core and
matrix spindles are affected by the terminations of their
respective ThCx pathways. The hypothesis, however, will
require further research to fully flesh out its implications to
the field of neuroscience. Below we outline some major issues
that need particular attention.
5.1. Heterogeneity of Spindle Oscillations. A consistent finding
reviewed in Introduction is the heterogeneity of cortical spindles. The hypothesis put forward in this study indicates a possible mechanism underlying this heterogeneity. A major issue
in the spindle literature that has become central in the past
few years is the challenge that more recent studies, often based
on iEEG, have contradicted the classical notion that spindles
are highly synchronous throughout the cortex [24, 27, 28].
The distinction between core and matrix spindles offers a
possible solution to these opposing views. According to this
hypothesis, the distinction between core and matrix spindles
reflects the distinction between local and widespread events.
This implies that spindles are not exclusively local, but spindle
oscillations might be synchronous within a cortical area or
across multiple areas depending on the underlying ThCx
pathways involved in their generation.
The prevalence of local or widespread spindles in a specific study might therefore be the consequence of recording
techniques that are more sensitive to the properties of core or
matrix spindles. In particular, the local properties of spindles
in iEEG studies might be explained by the fact that this

6
technique, similarly to MEG, is most sensitive to core spindles. This would account for the unexpectedly low synchrony
between iEEG and EEG spindles [28], which reflects the low
correspondence between MEG and EEG spindles [65]. Other
factors might be at play in animal studies. Core and matrix
ThCx pathways can be traced using sensitive labeling techniques [53], suggesting that neurons in these two pathways
might react differently to anesthetic and pharmacological
agents. Therefore, the application of a particular drug might
have the unintended consequence of silencing a specific ThCx
pathway. Attention is required in further studies in choosing
substances that minimize any side effect to the complex
dynamics involved in spindle generation.
A possible dissociation between core and matrix spindles
might be found in their sensitivity to circadian rhythms and
general arousal levels. It has been shown that the occurrence
of spindles depends on the circadian clock [70, 71], indicating
that at least some spindles are influenced by the modulation of
subcortical brain nuclei. Because the matrix ThCx pathways
are involved in maintaining the state of the cortex, it is conceivable that spindles generated within this pathway are more
sensitive to general arousal level, which are partly affected by
circadian rhythms.
Whether the dichotomy of core/matrix spindles is
reflected in other classifications that have been applied to
spindles, such as fast/slow spindles, remains an open question. To the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence that
indicates correspondence in the resonance frequency of the
spindle oscillations and the degree to which it is either focal
or widespread. There is also no known difference in resonance
frequency for the core versus matrix pathways which would
suggest that such a dichotomy would be expected. A confounding factor is the poor mapping of fast and slow spindles
between human and animal studies. Because most works
on the anatomy of core/matrix ThCx projections have been
conducted in animals, it is necessary to be cautious when
applying findings in animal models to the human brain as the
frequency ranges used in animals and humans might not be
directly comparable.
5.2. Plasticity and Memory Consolidation. The difference in
the spatial properties between core and matrix spindles
has several functional implications. The temporal dynamics
associated with spindle oscillations are known to favor neural
plasticity, by promoting short-term synaptic homeostasis [14,
72] and inducing NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation
[7], gene expression [6], and spike-timing-dependent plasticity [73]. These mechanisms are thought to underlie the
intimate link between spindles and memory consolidation
[2, 74–76]. While pioneering work in this field found a
topographically unspecific correlation between spindle count
and memory improvement and intelligence (reviewed in
[18]), the availability of high-density recordings has allowed
researchers to identify specific changes in spindle activity
in multiple brain regions. Spindles recorded above cortical
regions associated with the execution of the task had a
stronger correlation with postsleep improvement [77, 78],
suggesting that offline memory improvement is highly local
and anatomically constrained. When auditory memory cues

Neural Plasticity
which had been associated with visual stimuli during task
execution were selectively reactivated during sleep, regions
involved in visuospatial processing expressed spindles of
higher amplitude, indicating network-specific reactivation
of cortical memory traces [79]. High spatial specificity of
spindle oscillations for category of visual stimuli has been
suggested by correlated activity observed in temporal cortices
in an fMRI study [80].
Overall, these results indicate that memory consolidation
is associated with both a widespread increase and also specific
regional changes in spindle activity, depending on the task
design and the cortical regions involved in the neural plasticity. We propose that the dual role of spindles in memory
consolidation mirrors the distinction between matrix and
core spindles. It is conceivable that these two spindle types
might affect widespread or spatially constrained cortical
areas. While matrix spindles support a general activation of
the large cortical regions, core spindles might be implicated in
regulating the neural mechanisms underlying local memory
processing. This interpretation introduces the role of spindles
in neural plasticity as a flexible mechanism that adapts to the
cortical needs involved in memory consolidation.
Furthermore, the organization of the ThCx pathways
in circumscribed or widespread projections might reflect
the functional role associated with each spindle type. As
described above, core pathways dominate in primary sensory
areas, while matrix connections are more common in regions
commonly thought of as belonging to the association cortex.
Accordingly, sensory and motor areas might have higher
prevalence of core spindles, which, due to the limited fan-out
of the ThCx connections, are in a favorable position to induce
highly local plasticity within small cortical circuits. This
would provide a powerful mechanism to enhance learning of
specific sensory and motor skills. On the other hand, association cortices, such as the prefrontal regions, do not require
this high level of spatial specificity but instead they often integrate information from multiple distant cortical areas. Based
on the anatomy of the ThCx projections, these regions might
be expected to be more likely to generate matrix spindles,
which are perfectly posed to activate multiple regions and
favor memory consolidation across cortical areas [75].
These considerations fit nicely with the recent observation of spindles in the medial temporal lobe, more specifically
in the hippocampus. Doubts regarding a possible pathological origin [81, 82] have been dispelled after consistent findings
even in nonepileptic hippocampi [28, 29]. Hippocampal
spindles are thought to arise from a circuitry involving the
TRN and the anterior thalamic nucleus, with which the hippocampus shares reciprocal connections [83], similarly to the
ThCx generators involved in neocortical spindles. Because
the hippocampus is not organized in six distinct layers,
it is unclear whether the classification in core and matrix
pathways, and consequently in core and matrix spindles,
applies to the allocortex. Hippocampal spindles were found to
be more spatially restricted and to have lower synchrony [28],
suggesting that very local pathways connect the thalamus
to the hippocampus. This highly localized spindle activity
might be contrasted with the widespread activation observed
in the prefrontal cortex discussed above. These two regions

Neural Plasticity
are known to interact during memory encoding and retrieval
[84], and the interplay of sleep rhythms during sleep might
enhance memory consolidation during sleep [75].
5.3. Implications for Brain Disorders. The distinction between
core and matrix spindles holds great promise for the study of
brain disorders associated with disrupted spindle oscillations.
Changes in spindle activity have been observed in several disorders, the two most prominent of which are schizophrenia
[85, 86] and some forms of epilepsy [26, 87–89]. It is thought
that the same thalamocortical loops that are responsible for
spindle generation are hijacked in some forms of epilepsy [26,
90]. In particular, interictal spikes in some primarily generalized epilepsies are thought to arise from a disruption of the
same thalamocortical circuits that generate spindles [87, 91].
A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying
spindle generation will shed light on the thalamic and
cortical regions affected by these disorders. Multiple studies
investigating the role of sleep in neuropsychiatric disorders
have considered the spindle as a phenomenon with a single
generative mechanism [85, 86, 92, 93]. The hypothesis put
forward here on the other hand presents two partially independent ThCx pathways in the generation of core and matrix
spindles. Although currently the evidence is largely indirect,
we suggest that some of these disorders might affect only one
particular pathway, therefore resulting in abnormal core or
matrix spindles. Identification of which spindles are the most
affected by a particular disorder might improve the description of the underlying ThCx mechanisms, which will help
identify potential treatment targets. Preliminary steps have
already been taken in this direction, as in the work of Kandel
and Buzs´aki [46] comparing the laminar profile of normally occurring spindles with the pathologically high voltage
spike-and-wave spindles, a widely accepted animal model of
generalized spike-and-wave epilepsy.

6. Conclusions
Based on the importance of the ThCx circuits in spindle generation and the anatomical and hodological properties of the
core and matrix neurons, we have advanced the hypothesis
that the ThCx pathway will affect the spatial extent of spindle
oscillations. We propose a classification of core and matrix
spindles which can be studied with a variety of techniques,
such as EEG/MEG, laminar probes, and computational models. It is important to reiterate that the spindles are very likely
to have a mixture of the two extreme types, as we expect
that the contribution of each pathway evolves dynamically
throughout the course of every spindle. This classification
will be useful in guiding further hypothesis-driven investigations into the underlying mechanisms involved in spindle
generation and into the functional role of these emblematic
oscillations. This future work will help us better understand the cause of disorders affecting spindle oscillations
and hopefully will result in the development of therapeutic
interventions.

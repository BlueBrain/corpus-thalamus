CONCLUSIONS

1. To perform simulations of the various modes of action potential generation in thalamic relay neurons, we developed Hodgkin-and-Huxley
style mathematical
equations that describe the
voltage dependence and kinetics of activation and inactivation of
four different currents, including the transient, low-voltage-activated Ca 2+ current (Jr ), the rapidly inactivating
transient K+
current (IA), the slowly inactivating K+ current (I&,
and the
hyperpolarization-activated,
mixed cationic current (&). The
modeled currents were derived either from acutely dissociated rat
thalamic relay neurons (Jr, IA, JK2), or from guinea pig thalamic
relay cells maintained in slices in vitro (1iJ.
2. The voltage dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation of JT, JA, and & and the activation of Ii, could be modeled with Boltzmann-style
equations. Modeling of the behavior of
1T to depolarizing
steps in voltage clamp required the use of the
constant field equation to relate permeability to T-current amplitude. The time constant of activation of & was described by a
continuous bell-shaped function with a maximum near 15 ms at
threshold for activation (-75 mV) and 23°C. Mathematical
description of the kinetics of inactivation and removal of inactivation of this current required two separate functions.
3. The rapidly activating and inactivating K’ current IA was
modeled by assuming two components with different time constants of inactivation. The kinetics of activation was described as a
continuous
function of voltage with the slowest time constant,
near 2.5 ms, at threshold for activation (-60 mV) and 23°C. In
contrast, the kinetics of inactivation
of both components were
described as voltage independent,
consistent with experimental
data. The rate or removal of inactivation of both components of IA
was described as continuously increasing with the degree of hyperpolarization.
4. The slowly inactivating K+ current 1= was also modeled by
assuming two components with different rates of inactivation.
The kinetics of activation were described by a bell-shaped function
with a maximum time constant near 80 ms at -40 mV and 23°C
whereas threshold for activation was approximately
-60 mV. Inactivation of both components was modeled as relatively independent of voltage, whereas removal of inactivation was described as a
continuous function of membrane potential.
5. The hyperpolarization-activation
cationic current, &, was
modeled by assuming that the current activates with a single exponential relation and does not inactivate. The kinetics of activation
and deactivation of &, were described by a continuous and bellshaped function of membrane potential, with the slowest rate of
activation (time constant of - 1 s at 35°C) occurring at -80 mV,
which is near the membrane
potential
for half activation
(-75 mV).
6. The analysis and modeling of the voltage dependence, kinetics, and reversal potentials of these four currents, Jr, IA, JK2,

and &, predict that & should provide the inward current for the
generation of low-threshold
Ca2+ spikes, with the rapidly activating and inactivating K+ current IA modulating
the initial components of these Ca2+ spikes. In contrast, the slower kinetics of activation and inactivation
of the K+ current JK2 suggest that this
current may affect more the later portions of low-threshold
Ca2+
spikes. The properties of & suggest that it is critical to modulation
of the voltage-time course of the cell at hyperpolarized
membrane
potentials and may provide a “pacemaker”
potential for rhythmic
burst generation.

INTRODUCTION

Thalamic relay neurons are capable of firing Na+-dependent spikes in a variety of patterns (Deschenes et al. 1982;
Llinas and Jahnsen 1982), which occur in stereotyped fashion during different states of behavioral arousal (reviewed
in Steriade and Deschenes 1984; Steriade and Llinas 1988 ) .
The spike firing patterns are, in turn, determined by the
array of voltage-dependent ion channels present within the
relay neuron plasma membrane. One interesting feature of
thalamic relay neurons is their ability to generate rhythmic
bursts discharges, owing to the occurrence of low-threshold
Ca2+ spikes (Jahnsen and Llinas 1984a,b; McCormick and
Pape 1990; Steriade et al. 199 1). Several currents have been
identified that are activated in the range of potentials near
the threshold for action potential generation and that are
likely to be involved in this generation of rhythmic lowthreshold Ca2+ spikes. These currents include 1-r, the lowthreshold, transient Ca2+ current that underlies burst firing
(Coulter et al. 1989; Crunelli et al. 1989; Hernandez-Cruz
and Pape 1989; Huguenard and Prince 1992; Suzuki and
Rogawski 1989 ) ; the rapidly inactivating and transient K+
current, IA (Huguenard et al. 199 1 ), which may facilitate
slow repetitive firing (Connor and Stevens 197 1) and may
interact with & during Ca2+-dependent burst firing (Huguenard et al. 199 1); a slowly inactivating transient K+
current, & (Huguenard and Prince 199 1 ), which may
control repetitive firing rate; and a hyperpolarization-activated, mixed cationic conductance with slow kinetics, &
(McCormick and Pape 1990; Pape and McCormick 1989),
which activates on hyperpolarization
and which may generate a “pacemaker”
potential for the generation of slow
oscillations. In this paper we collect both published and
unpublished voltage-clamp data and present mathematical
descriptions of these four separate ionic conductances. Our

goal was to use the results of these voltage-clamp experiments to obtain the parameters necessary to simulate voltage and current behavior in a model thalamocortical
relay
neuron. In the following paper (McCormick
and Huguenard 1992) we present the results of voltage simulations in
which multiple relay neuron firing modes are reproduced.
METHODS

As in the studies of Hodgkin and Huxley ( 1952), each macroscopic current was modeled as being comprised of a population of
equivalent microscopic ion channels. Each channel is controlled
by at least one gate, and all gates of any individual channel must be
open for the channel to be conducting. The gate opening and
closing rates are voltage-dependent
processes that can be determined experimentally
by examining macroscopic
records. We
adopted the approach of Connor and Stevens ( 197 1) and Beluzzi
and Sacchi ( 1988 ), in which it is not necessary to determine separately the forward and reverse rate constants, but instead determined the time constant 7 as a function of voltage. From Hodgkin
and Huxley ( 1952) it is possible to predict time-dependent
changes for each gate at a given membrane potential by knowing
the voltage-dependent
values of gate, and 7gate, in accordance
with Eq. 1. With the given gate

values, normalized
conductance
can be calculated. We have
adopted the nomenclature
that Hodgkin and Huxley used for Na+
current, and generalized it in Eq. 2 for all inactivating conductances so that activation gate is denoted by m and the inactivation
gate by h
g=mNh

(2)

The value of 2 is normalized to a maximum value of 1 because m
and h are continuous variables between 0 and 1. Currents are
obtained from Ohm’s law

is the maximum conductance, E is the membrane pogmax
tential, and EEy is the equilibrium
(reversal) potential for the
current. For Ca + currents, the constant-field equation was used

and T have the usual meanings (Hille 1984).
To simulate voltage-dependent
currents with given values of
g max and EEq~ it is necessary to predict the value of 7,) 7h, h, , and
mco- We have derived empirical functions that describe each of
these four variables as a function of membrane potential for each
of the currents studied here. Results from many experiments,
which included new data as well as those from previously published studies, were collated and graphed on a common axis to
demonstrate the variability in both voltage-dependent
time constants and Boltzmann style “steady-state” activation and inactivation curves. Data from several cells are shown so that the range of
variability can be observed. This provides a rational basis for adjusting parameters of the model within a certain range (e.g., within
1 SD of the mean). Empirical curves were fitted to the average
data and then displayed on the same graphs as the raw data. The
standard Boltzmann
equation was used to describe both activation and inactivation

where K,, is the membrane potential at whit h the channels are half
(in)activated,
k is the slope factor related to the valence of charge
that must be displaced to switch between closed and permissive
states, and N is a power factor that influences the amplitude-time
course of the current (e.g., such as the “delay” of activation in
voltage clamp). The power factor N may be thought of as the
number of (in)activation
gates, each of which must be in the permissive state for the channel to be conductive.
The rate constants for both the inactivation and activation processes were taken to be continuous functions of voltage. For the
inactivation process, voltage-dependent
time constants were determined either from the time constant of macroscopic current
decay at suprathreshold
potentials or from the time course of recovery from inactivation
(deinactivation)
in the subthreshold
range. Activation
rate was obtained from best fitted HodgkinHuxley curves

where 7, and 7-h are the activation and inactivation
time constants, respectively; N is as defined above; and I, is a measure of
activation, i.e., the maximal current level that would be reached in
the absence of inactivation (7h equal to infinity.). For potentials
negative to activation threshold, the reverse activation process
(deactivation)
was determined by fitting exponential decay curves
to the tail currents obtained after current activation. Because closing of each channel requires only one of the activation gates to
change state, the time constant of decay of the tail current (Tail)
will be 1 /N of that for deactivation of single m gates (7,,,). For
example, in the case of IT, which is best fitted with an m2h-type
equation, the time constant of tail current decay is only half as
long as the time constant of deactivation of single m gates and
therefore 7, was determined as 2 X 7,ail (where Vtair is in the membrane potential range where m, approaches zero; Hagiwara and
Ohmori 1982).
Data for IT, I*, and IK2 were derived from whole cell voltageclamp studies obtained from acutely isolated ventroposterior
relay
neurons from young rats (7- 14 days old) (Coulter et al. 1989;
Huguenard et al. 199 1; Huguenard
and Prince 1992). With the
exception of studies characterizing the temperature dependence of
the ionic currents, all isolated cell experiments were performed at
room temperature (23-25°C)
and were compensated for capacitance and leak currents with a P/ 4 type subtraction protocol. Data
for Ih were obtained from neurons in adult guinea pig dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus using switched-single-electrode
voltageclamp recordings with sharp electrodes in slices maintained
in
vitro at 35.5OC.
RESULTS

Of the multiple types of ionic current known to be present in thalamocortical
relay cells, four of those that are involved in the generation of rhythmic burst discharges (IT,
IA, 1=, and &J have recently been characterized in detail
(Coulter et al. 1989; Huguenard and Prince 199 1; Huguenard et al. 199 1; McCormick
and Pape 1990). Here we
develop mathematical
descriptions of the low-threshold
Ca2+ current IT, the rapidly inactivating K+ current JA, the
slowly inactivating K+ current 1=, and the hyperpolarization-activated cation current & for use in computational

Voltage-dependent

properties of thala-

T-current models

The present mathematical
description of the T-current
was based on results obtained in parallel with a recent study
that compared the properties of Jr in thalamic neurons of
the reticular thalamic nucleus with those from ventroposterior relay nuclei ( Huguenard and Prince 1992). In these
recent studies, slightly different recording conditions were
used from those of the original report on Jr in relay nuclei
(Coulter et al. 1989 ) to improve the separation of 1= from
other voltage-gated conductances. Because the results of the
recent study (Huguenard and Prince 1992) provide more
accurate data, these data were used in the development of
the voltage-dependent model for &.
Normalized steady-state inactivation data from several
relay cells are shown in Fig. 1A. We assumed that &- was
composed of a uniform population of channels whose inactivation could be completely described by the Boltzmann
function (Eq. 5). These cells in Fig. 1 were selected from a
larger population of neurons as those best fitted ( r2 >
0.995) to Eq. 5 and thus deemed to be those under the most
accurate voltage-clamp control. The average Boltzmann

function (parameters given in Table I) is displayed as the
continuous curve. Although there was some cell-to-cell variability in the position along the voltage axis, the slope of the
curve was relatively constant.
Activation functions can be obtained from fitting Eq. 6 to
the current traces obtained from depolarizations into the
range of potentials where Jr is evoked (Coulter et al. 1989).
However, it is necessary to know the equilibrium
potential
for the current to convert these curves to conductances, as is
required to obtain the m, curve (Hodgkin and Huxley
1952 ) . Because obtaining the reversal potential for Ca2+
conductances and fitting complicated functions to experimental current traces are both somewhat unreliable proceTABLE

dures, approximate activation curves were obtained with
the use of tail current protocols (Fig. 1 Bl), in which the
membrane potential at which activation is measured remains fixed (Hagiwara and Ohmori 1982; Regan 199 1).
Therefore, if we assume that the equilibrium
potential is
constant, then the driving force (E - EEq) remains fixed,
and normalized tail current amplitude can be used as a
measure of the T-channel conductance evoked by the command step.
Normalized activation curves obtained from tail current
amplitudes are also shown in Fig. 1A. Cells were again selected on a basis of goodness of fit to Eq. 5 with N = 2 and
are not necessarily the same cells used for inactivation data.
The dashed line is the average squared Boltzmann distribution with K,, = -59 mV and k = -5.2 mV-‘. The overlap
of the two curves determines the membrane potential range
where a window current would be persistently activated.
Considering the variability in the position of the activation
and inactivation curves along the voltage axis, we wanted to
ensure that the degree of overlap was accurately modeled.
In fact, we found that the average separation between LJ,*s
for activation and inactivation curves in individual cells
(22 t 0.6 mV, y2 = 17) was identical to the separation between average K,,s (-8 1 mV to -59 mV = 22 mV).
Although tail currents amplitudes estimate activation,
they do not measure the mco2curve directly because Jr is an
inactivating current . A consequence of a fixed-duration
(e.g., 30 ms) depolarization is that for small depolarizations
activation is not quite complete, yet for strong depolarizations significant inactivation has occurred during the step.
To compensate for this inherent problem of voltage-clamp
analysis of inactivating currents, we empirically chose parameters for the m, curve (Table 1) in the model that resulted in a simulated tail current activation curve (Fig.
1 B2, and gray shaded symbols in Fig. 1A) equivalent to
that obtained with neurons. This method presumably results in a more accurate description of the Boltzmann activation function that describes Jr.
Activation kinetics for & displayed a bell .-shaped voltage
dependency (Fig. 1C) similar to that seen for Na+ and K+
currents (Hodgkin and Huxley 1952). The smooth curve is
drawn according to

Inactivation kinetics for Jr were biphasic. Recovery from
inactivation occurred at much slower rates (250-400 ms at
potentials between - 100 and -80 mV, Fig. 10) than
current inactivation (25- 130 ms in the range of -75-O mV,
Fig. 1 D) . It was thus difficu lt to obtain a simple continuous
function that described the voltage dependence of the inactivation time constant (Q), and two separate functions
were derived and are presented in Eq. 8.

D. A. MCCORMICK

The fitted curve at hyperpolarized potentials was chosen to
reflect the slope of the voltage-dependent recovery process
within cells, rather than to attempt to obtain a curve fitted
to all data points in which case the slope describing recovery
would be too shallow at hyperpolarized membrane potentials.
Simulations

of T-current

Simulations were performed to test whether the voltagedependent models for Jr could reproduce voltage-clamp results obtained from relay neurons. Time- and voltage-dependent values of m and h were calculated based on Eq. 1,
and currents were then obtained from the constant-field
equation (Eq. 4). Families of currents generated by this
means reproduced both the time course and amplitude of
actual current traces (Fig. 2A). Peak current amplitude was
negligible below -70 mV and gradually increased as the
command step was made more positive. Maximum
peak
current occurred near -38 mV in both the example relay
neuron and the simulation (Fig. 2 Bl ). On the other hand,
the peak current-voltage (I-V) relationship could not be
accurately reproduced when an ohmic relation betwe-n
voltage, current, and T-conductance (Eq. 3) was usea
rather than the constant-field equation (Eq. 4). For example, with the ohmic equation, the maximal amplitude occurred at more depolarized potentials and exhibited very
gradual reductions with further depolarizations in comparison with the constant-field relation and the actual data.
Notably, the model was able to accurately reproduce peak
current amplitudes (Fig. 2 B2).
Initial reports indicated that recovery from inactivation
of Jr was biexponential
in relay neurons (Coulter et al.
1989). However, using the voltage protocol shown in Fig.
2C, we have found that recovery could be described by a
monoexponential
process. Here the holding membrane potential is set to -40 mV to completely inactivate Jr (see Fig.
1A). After brief hyperpolarization
to -90 mV, a small I,
was activated on return to -40 mV and current amplitude
increased as the hyperpolarization
was lengthened. The
time course of recovery from inactivation
was well described as an exponential process with 7recovequal to 300 ms
at this membrane potential (dashed line). The simulation
model reproduced this result (Fig. 2C3). In other experiments, varying the step potential from - 110 to -80 mV
revealed T,,,~~ to vary in a voltage-dependent manner, as
modeled by Eq. 8 above (not shown).
Voltage-dependent

A-current models

A prominent current in isolated thalamocortical
relay
neurons is the rapidly inactivating K+ current known as 1*
(Huguenard et al. 199 1). Steady-state inactivation data for
1* from several cells (Fig. 3 A) show that there was clustering of many values near the mean. However, occasionally
there were variants (e.g., 0 in Fig. 3A). This may reflect the
fact that ventroposterior relay neurons are not a uniform
population of cells, as far as transient K+ currents are concerned. Nevertheless, we have developed a model of 1* in
the “average” relay neuron. The smooth curve is the aver-

age Boltzmann curve for steady-state inactivation in four
cells with similar properties ( Fig. 3A ; parameters given in
Table 1).
Activation of 1* was more difficult to describe than inactivation, in that a simple Boltzmann curve could not be well
fitted to the data. One explanation consistent with these
results is that “IA” is actually composed of two different
populations of voltage-gated channels. We empirically modeled 1* as the sum of two independent currents with comparable activation kinetics and steady-state inactivation. In
support of the hypothesis of two populations of channels
was the finding that the time course of 1* inactivation was
biexponential, and the proportion of the slow and fast decaying components changes as a function of voltage (Huguenard et al. 199 1). The gray circles in Fig. 3A are the
results of simulation in which the tail current activation
curve was obtained. The simulated current was modeled as
the sum of two currents ( IAl and I**) with parameters given
in Table 1 and with the more rapidly decaying component,
JAI, accounting for 60% of the total 1* conductance. With
the two activation curves (Table 1) having different voltage
dependencies, small depolarizations favor activation of IAl,
whereas stronger depolarizations activate increasing proportions of IA2, as was reported for whole cell 1* (Huguenard et al. 1991).
Activation kinetics for 1* (Fig. 3C) were obtained by fitting current traces to Eq. 6 with N = 4 (Huguenard et al.
199 1), and deactivation rates at potentials less than -60

mV were estimated by dividing tail current time constant
by 4. Activation time constant displayed a bell-shaped dependence on voltage that was described by

and plotted as the continuous curve in Fig. 3C. As indicated previously, inactivation of 1* proceeded with two decay time constants, and the slower component became
more prominent with stronger depolarizations. However,
both time constants were independent of membrane potential (Fig. 3 D). In contrast, the rate of recovery from inactivation was highly voltage sensitive (Fig. 3 D), with time
constant values varying between 12 and 65 ms in the range
of - 140 to -80 mV. The smooth curve in Fig. 3 D is drawn

The kinetics of removal of inactivation for the slower component (Th2) were similar to those for 7h l, but inactivation
occurred with a slower, but constant rate. Therefore, for
membrane potentials less than -73 mV, Th2was modeled as
being equal to Thl and at other potentials was 60 ms.

of A-current

The A-current was described as the sum of a rapidly ( ZAl )
and more slowly (ZJ inactivating components. Each subcomponent ( ZAl and Z& was described by Eqs. 2 and 3 with
varying between 11.2 and 50 nS while
N = 4 and
gmaxA1
8 maxA varied from 7.5 to 33 nS. Voltage-clamp simulations
(Fig. 3 B) reproduced the essential features of ZA. Currents
activated rapidly on depolarization,
and then inactivated;
as the command potential was increased, peak current occurred earlier and the slower decay component became
more prominent.
Voltage-dependent

models for ZK2

Application of depolarizing voltage steps to isolated thalamocortical relay neurons reveals a second inactivating K+
current that is sensitive to block by tetraethylammonium
(TEA) and that has been termed ZU (Huguenard and
Prince 199 1). The steady-state activation curve for JK2 displays a threshold of approximately
-60 mV and extends
across a broad voltage range up to +30 mV (Fig. 4A). The

slowly increasing slope of the activation curve at membrane
potentials between -60 and -30 mV made this curve difficult to fit with a simple Boltzmann equation with N equal
to 1. Increasing N to 4 greatly increased the accuracy of the
fit, particularly at these membrane potentials. However, examination of the time course of activation of Zk2 does not
reveal any substantial delay or “S” shape during activation
(Fig. 402), as would be expected for m4h-type kinetics. We
therefore chose different values of N to accurately model
both activation rate (Eq. 6 with N = 1) and steady-state
activation (Eq. 5 with N = 4). This compromise yielded
reasonable simulations for both amplitude and time course
of Z= (Fig. 4C).
A recent investigation of Z= suggested that this current
may display incomplete steady-state inactivation ( Fig. 4 A ;
Huguenard and Prince 199 1). However, this incomplete
inactivation may have resulted from the duration of the
inactivating voltage steps used in this experiment (2 s) being of insufficient duration to allow complete inactivation
of this slowly inactivating current (see below). Here we
have modeled Z= as a completely inactivating current with

1= the proportion of the two decay components was not

curves (Table 1) were
taken to be the same for both components, lkZa and IUb,

for 60% of the total. Activation time constants for both Ima

As for the rapidly inactivating K+ current 1*, the slowly
inactivating K+ current 1= was modeled as the sum of two
components ( Ima and 1r& that inactivate at different
rates. Each component was modeled according to Eqs. 2
and 3 with N = 1 and maximal conductances ranging between 6.4 and 39 nS for gmaxma and 4.3 and 26 nS for
gmaxmb. Simulated currents reproduced the important features of the experimental data. Tail current activation protocols accurately simulated (gray circles in Fig. 4A) the results from relay neurons. In addition, simulated 1= had a
relatively long latency to peak that was best fitted with a
m% relation as in the original report (Huguenard and
Prince 199 1)) and the current decayed with two time con-

stants near 1 and 10 s at room temperature (Fig. 4C). During simulations of the voltage-clamp behavior of 1=, we
found that the apparent incomplete inactivation obtained
with the original steady-state protocols (Huguenard and
Prince 199 1) was probably a consequence of using an insufficiently long conditioning pulse (2 s was typically used), so
that the 1= channels were not at true steady state. Simulations obtained with the same protocol reproduced the apparent incomplete inactivation (Fig. 40 and gray squares
in Fig. 4A), whereas true steady-state inactivation protocols produced complete inactivation (shaded inactivation
line in Fig. 4A).

tion appears to be justified, given the lack of an apparent
delay in the activation of & (Fig. 54). Comparison of voltage-clamp recordings from guinea pig thalamocortical
relay
cells (Fig. 5C) with the results of the simulation (Fig. 5 D)
reveal several similarities including the voltage dependence
and kinetics of activation and deactivation. The presence of
an additional, faster component to the tail currents during
deactivation of & in guinea pig dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus cells ( Fig. 5C) is due to the presence of &-, which was
not blocked in these biological experiments (McCormick
and Pape 1990).
DISCUSSION

Detailed descriptions of the electrophysiological
properties of neurons require a thorough investigation of the properties of the underlying currents, their spatial localization,
and their sensitivity to alteration from intracellular and extracellular signals. Here we have formulated mathematical
descriptions of four ionic currents present in thalamocortical relay cells, using the methods pioneered by Hodgkin
and Huxley ( 1952). These four ionic currents, &, 1*, lkZ,
and &, were chosen on the basis of their robust presence in
thalamocortical
relay neurons, their probable contribution
to the ability of thalamic relay neurons to generate rhythmic burst discharges, and their presence at membrane potentials at or near rest and action potential threshold.
T-current
The low-threshold Ca2+ current, or T-current, is likely to
be the main inward current in the production of low-threshold Ca2+ spikes ( LTS; Llinas and Jahnsen 1982). A number of notable features of &- are replicated in the present
mathematical model, which predicts a dominant contribution of this current to the generation of low-threshold Ca2+
spikes. First, the voltage dependence of & activation is in
the membrane potential range of -70 to -40 mV, and inactivation occurs at membrane potentials between -90 and
-60 mV in similarity with the activation and inactivation
range of the low-threshold Ca2+ spike (see Jahnsen and
Llinas 1984a,b). Second, the rate of activation of 1T is considerably more rapid than its rate of inactivation (e.g., Fig.
1, C and D), a property that should facilitate the generation
of prolonged ( 10s of ms) low-threshold Ca2+ spikes. The
near completeness of steady-state inactivation at normal
resting membrane potentials (-63 mV) for rodent thalamocortical relay neurons and the position of the inactivation and activation curves on the voltage axis for & (see Fig.
1A) further predict that thalamocortical
relay neurons at
this membrane potential are ideally situated to respond to
hyperpolarizing inputs, whether induced by current injection or by inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, with a rebound Ca2+ spike-mediated burst of action potentials, as
found in vitro and in vivo (Deschenes et al. 1982; Jahnsen
and Llinas 1984a,b). The rate of removal of inactivation
found here was well described by a single exponential function, in contrast to previous voltage-clamp data (Coulter et
al. 1989) and a computational
model based on this data
(Wang et al. 199 1) . Furthermore, the model presented here

CLAMP

SIMULATION

1381

predicts a time constant for removal of inactivation of near
70 ms at -90 mV and at physiological temperatures (e.g.,
37°C). This slow time course suggests that decreasing the
interval between low-threshold Ca2+ spikes to less than
-500 ms will result in significant decreases in the amplitude of each Ca2+ spike (other than the first), as is found in
rodent thalamocortical
relay neurons in vitro (McCormick
and Feeser 1990). In addition, although it will depend critically on the amplitude and distribution of &- and other biophysical features of thalamocortical
relay cells, this rate of
removal of inactivation suggests that thalamocortical
relay
cells may not be capable of generating rhythmic low-threshold Ca2+ spikes at frequencies in excess of - 12- 14 Hz, a
prediction that is in good agreement with the highest frequency of rhythmic low-threshold Ca2+ spike generation in
vivo (Shosaku et al. 1989; Steriade and Deschenes 1984).
Although the contribution of &- to the generation of lowthreshold Ca2’ spikes is now well established, the voltage
dependency and kinetics of this current suggest that it may
also contribute to other electrophysiological
properties of
thalamic relay cells. For example, the presence of a small
degree of overlap in the activation and inactivation curves
for I, suggests that this current may exhibit a steady, but
small, activation at certain membrane potentials (e.g.,
around -70 mV), which may facilitate a tonic depolarization of these neurons at or near resting membrane potentials. In addition, the presence of large ( lo-20 mV) and
prolonged (up to 60 ms) hyperpolarizations
after the generation of single action potentials suggests that these hyperpolarizations may be of sufficient amplitude to partially remove inactivation of IT, thereby allowing this current to
contribute to the generation of single spike activity, a hypothesis that remains to be tested in thalamocortical
relay
neurons. The predicted slow time course of &-mediated
Ca2+ spikes and the extension of activation up to -40 mV
suggests that these events may activate not only the Na+
and K+ currents involved in the generation of action potentials, but also the rapidly and slowly inactivating
K+
currents 1* and 1=. The actions of these currents, in turn,
may modulate the amplitude-time
course of low-threshold
Ca2+ spikes.
A-current
The voltage-dependent and kinetic properties of 1A suggest that this current may contribute to both low-threshold
Ca2+ spikes and fast Na+ spikes. In particular, the slower
rate of activation of 1* in comparison with 1* and the activation threshold of 1’ of around -60 mV (cf. Figs. 1C and
4C) suggests that 1* may have considerable effects on the
rising phase of low-threshold Ca2’ spikes. In addition, the
activation kinetics of 1* are probably sufficiently fast to allow contribution to the repolarization
of Na+-dependent
action potentials, as has been hypothesized in other neuronal cell types (see Storm 1990). Although the kinetics of
inactivation are complex, they could be accurately reproduced by assuming the whole cell 1* to be composed of two
separate conductance mechanisms (Table I). Because 1*
inactivates rapidly (with 7 values near 4 and 15 ms at -40
mV and 37°C) it probably does not contribute to regulating

1382

J. R. HUGUENARD

AND

rhythmic LTS activity, but on the other hand it can contribute to shaping the amplitude-time
course of LTSs. In addition, the movement of the membrane potential between
-50 and -70 mV during the generation of Na+-dependent
action potentials also suggests that activation of 1* may contribute to the control of repetitive firing (e.g., Connor and
Stevens 197 1). The lack of substantial overlap of the
steady-state activation and inactivation curves for 1* suggests that this current is not likely to contribute strongly to
“tonic” properties of thalamocortical
relay cells, such as
resting membrane potential and input resistance.
Slowly inactivating

K-current, IK2

The slowly inactivating K+ -current, 1=, displays a number of interesting features. Both the membrane potential
range of activation and inactivation extend through large
parts of the voltage axis. The membrane potential range of
activation extends from below Na+ spike firing threshold
(approximately
-55 mV) to membrane potentials positive
to 0 mV ( Fig. 5 A ) , whereas inactivation extends from - 100
mV up to membrane potentials substantially positive to firing threshold (e.g., up to -20 mV). The kinetics of inactivation of this current are quite slow, with time constants
near 300 and 2,500 ms at physiological temperature,
whereas the kinetics of activation are substantially faster.
These properties predict that 1= will contribute substantially to the amplitude-time
course of low-threshold Ca2+
spikes and may contribute to their repolarization, a prediction confirmed in the accompanying paper (McCormick
and Huguenard 1992). In addition, the activation threshold of 1= at membrane potentials negative to firing threshold suggests that this current may retard the approach of the
membrane potential toward the activation of action potentials on depolarization. Although the above hypotheses remain to be tested in thalamocortical
relay neurons, recent
intracellular recordings in vitro from guinea pig dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus cells have revealed the presence of a
current, called IAs, which also activates in the same voltage
range and inactivates with a time course similar to 1= ( 100s
ms to s; McCormick
199 1). Pharmacological
examination
of the functional contribution of IAs to the firing properties
of thalamic relay cells suggests that this current generates a
substantial delay on depolarization to the onset of action
potential discharge and also contributes to the repolarization of the low-threshold Ca2+ spike (McCormick
199 1).
Therefore, functionally, 1= and lAs appear to have a number of similarities. However, a substantial difference between these currents is that 1= is sensitive to block by TEA
and not 4-aminopyridine
(4-AP), whereas ZAsis highly sensitive to 4-AP but not TEA (Huguenard and Prince 199 1;
McCormick
199 1). The possible presence of two slowly
inactivating K+ currents in thalamocortical
relay neurons
with very similar voltage-dependent characteristics remains
to be examined in more detail.
In addition to modulating the response of thalamocortical relay neurons to tonic depolarization,
the kinetics and
voltage-dependent properties of JK2 also suggest that this
current may be involved in the control of repetitive single
spike activity, particularly
in between sequential Na+

spikes, in a manner similar to 1*. However, the slow kinetics of 1= suggest that this current may exhibit only small
changes in activation and inactivation during the generation of action potentials, even though it may strongly affect
the pattern of action potentials generated (see McCormick
and Huguenard 1992).
H-current
The voltage dependence of activation of the hyperpolarization-activated
cation current & was well fitted by a
Boltzmann equation, whereas the kinetics of activation and
deactivation appeared as a bell-shaped curve centered
around half activation. These properties of & are remarkably similar to those of the hyperpolarization-activated
cation current &present in single sinoatrial cells (e.g., Nobel et
al. 1989). In these cells, I, is believed to contribute to the
generation of the “pacemaker” potential, i.e., the flow of
ions that drives the membrane toward the threshold for
generation of each action potential (see DiFrancesco
1985 ) . Similarly, the properties of & modeled here predict
that hyperpolarization
of thalamic relay neurons will result
in a repolarization of the membrane to more depolarized
levels, thereby resulting in a depolarizing “sag.” The amplitude-time course of this depolarization will depend on the
degree of hyperpolarization,
because increasing the hyperpolarization will result in a stronger and more rapid activation of 1h (e.g., Fig. 7, A and B). Recent intracellular recordings in cat lateral geniculate relay neurons reveal the presence of a C&sensitive
“pacemaker” potential in between
the generation of low-threshold Ca2+ spikes, suggesting that
& may contribute to the generation of slow, rhythmic burst
firing (McCormick
and Pape 1990; Soltesz et al. 199 1).
This hypothesis is confirmed and extended in the accompanying paper on the basis of the mathematical description
of & developed here (McCormick
and Huguenard 1992).
Limitations

ofthe models of ionic currents

We have attempted to develop mathematical
descriptions of four different currents that exist in thalamocortical
relay neurons. These descriptions are useful in predicting
the amplitude-time
course of each of these currents given a
complicated voltage trajectory, such as that which occurs in
neurons during the generation of action potentials. However, the models also have limitations. First, the spatial distribution of the different ionic currents in thalamocortical
relay cells is for the most part unknown and may have important consequences on the activity of these cells and their
response to synaptic inputs. Second, we have considered
thalamocortical
relay neurons of different sensory and motor nuclei to be composed of a relatively homogenous population. Heterogeneity among different relay cells in different nuclei (e.g., McCormick and Prince 1988) or within the
same nucleus (Bloomfield et al. 1987; Mastronarde 1987)
may have important functional consequences ( e.g., the presence or absence or rhythmic burst discharges or “lagged”
visual responses). Third, the dynamics of Ca2+ buffering in
thalamic relay neurons have not yet been investigated. Finally, the present model of ionic currents is of only limited

THALAMIC

value in describing the properties of the single ionic channels that underlie these currents, which, at least in the case
of IA and I=, may themselves be composed of a wide variety of subtypes of channels. However, despite these and
other potential problems, the present simulations of whole
cell currents in thalamocortical
relay cells are capable of
reconstructing many of the basic electrophysiological
features of these neurons (McCormick
and Huguenard 1992)
and therefore are of value in understanding the physiological properties of thalamic function.

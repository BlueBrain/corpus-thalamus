Firing in GABAergic Neurons of Rat Thalamic Reticular Nucleus

The inhibitory GABAergic
projection
of thalamic nucleus reticularis (nRt) neurons onto thalamocortical
relay cells (TCs)
is important in generating
the normal thalamocortical
rhythmicity of slow wave sleep, and may be a key element in the
production
of abnormal
rhythms associated
with absence
epilepsy.
Both TCs and nRt cells can generate
prominent
Ca*+-dependent
low-threshold
spikes, which evoke bursts
of Na+-dependent
fast spikes, and are influential
in rhythm
generation.
Substantial
differences
in the pattern of burst
firing in TCs versus nRt neurons led us to hypothesize
that
there are distinct forms of transient Ca*+ current (/,) underlying burst discharges
in these two cell types. Using wholecell voltage-clamp
recordings,
we analyzed IT in acutely isolated TCs and nRt neurons and found three key differences
in biophysical
properties.
(1) The transient
Ca*+ current in
nRt neurons inactivated
much more slowly than 1, in TCs.
This slow current is thus termed /,,. (2) The rate of inactivation for /,, was nearly voltage independent.
(3) Whole-cell
ITS amplitude
was increased
when Ba*+ was substituted
for
Ca*+ as the charge carrier. In addition,
activation
kinetics
were slower for /,, and the activation
range was depolarized
compared
to that for /,. Other properties
of /,, and 1, were
similar, including
steady-state
inactivation
and sensitivities
to blockade
by divalent cations, amiloride,
and antiepileptic
drugs. Our findings demonstrate
that subtypes
of transient
Ca? current are present in two different classes of thalamic
neurons.
The properties
of I,, lead to generation
of longduration calcium-dependent
spike bursts in nRt cells. The
resultant prolonged
periods of GABA release onto TCs would
play a critical role in maintaining
rhythmicity
by inducing TC
hyperpolarization
and promoting
generation
of low-threshold calcium spikes within relay nuclei.

Certain oscillatory rhythms within the cerebral cortex are a
consequenceof both thalamocortical circuitry and intrinsic
properties of thalamic neurons (Steriade and Llinls, 1988; Ribary et al., 1991). The thalamus is intimately involved in generation of the rhythmic high-voltage, 7-l 4 Hz spindlesobserved
in the EEG during certain phasesof sleep.‘Early evidence of
this wasprovided by Morison and Bassett(1945), who showed

that after corticotomy spindleactivity could still be recorded in
the thalamus. A key element in rhythm generation within the
thalamus is the GABAergic nucleusreticularis (nRt) that is reciprocally connectedto thalamocortical relay neurons(TCs) of
dorsal thalamic nuclei and also receives collateral excitatory
connectionsfrom corticothalamic fibers(Jones, 1985).Through
a seriesof in vivo experiments, Steriade, Deschenes,and colleagueshave identified nRt as a key site in the generation of
spindle rhythms. During periods of sleepassociatedwith EEG
synchronization, spindlesare absentin anterior thalamic nuclei
that are devoid of connectionswith nRt (Mulle et al., 1985)and
in relay nuclei that have been disconnectedfrom nRt by transection(Steriadeet al., 1985).On the other hand, spindlespersist
in nRt after it has been isolated from other thalamic nuclei
(Steriadeet al., 1987),when suchactivity is absentin relay nuclei
and in the cortex. These findings implicate the thalamus, and
especially nRt, as important rhythm generation sites.
Intrinsic firing properties of nRt cells are an important factor
in promoting rhythm generation. Neurons in nRt are characterized by two basic firing patterns (Domich et al., 1986; McCormick and Prince, 1986; Mulle et al., 1986; Steriade et al.,
1986; Llinas and Geijo-Barrientos, 1988;Spreaficoet al., 1988),
similar to those in TCs (Descheneset al., 1982; Llinas and
Jahnsen, 1982). In both cell types, regular repetitive firing is the
normal responseto excitatory inputs under conditions where
the resting membrane potential is relatively depolarized. However, with membrane hyperpolarization, the sameinputs produce Ca2+-dependentlow-threshold spikes(LTSs) that can trigger several fast Naf spikes. In TCs, the LTS is mediated by a
transient Ca*+ current (T-current, Zr; Coulter et al., 1989a;Crunelli et al., 1989; Hernbndez-Cruz and Pape, 1989; Suzuki and
Rogawski, 1989), and presumably the sameor a similar conductancemechanismunderliesLTS generationin nRt cells.Since
the LTS in nRt is blocked by Cd*+ (Avanzini et al., 1989) but
persistsin the presenceof the Naf channel blocker QX-3 14
(Mulle et al., 1986),it isprobably mediated by a similar transient
Ca*+ current. Interestingly, however, the LTSs and burst-firing
patterns in nRt cellsare fundamentally different from their counterparts in TCs. Extracellular recordingsin chronically implanted unanesthetizedanimalsclearly demonstratethat TCs exhibit
monophasic spike bursts consistingof 2-10 spikeswith an averageduration of 8 msec(Domich et al., 1986). In contrast, nRt
cells recorded under the sameconditions fire bursts consisting
of two phases,an early high-frequency “core” burst lasting 50100 msec, and a late phase of tonic firing that can last for
hundreds of milliseconds(Domich et al., 1986; Steriade et al.,
1986). While little is known about the mechanismsunderlying
the tonic firing phase,the core burst is presumablymediated by
an LTS. In fact, in vivo intracellular recordingsreveal that LTSs

in nRt cells are considerably longer than those in TCs (Mulle
et al., 1986; Shosaku et al., 1989). Although an extended barrage
of EPSPs onto nRt neurons can contribute to elongated LTS
bursts under some circumstances, including spindle activity,
long bursts also can be induced by intracellular current injection,
indicating that nRt cells have intrinsic mechanisms for producing such activity. The prolonged Ca2+-dependent bursts in
the GABAergic neurons of nRt presumably evoke either long
trains of IPSPs or large IPSPs (due to rapid release of large
amounts of GABA) in TCs. In either case,activation of GABA,
receptor-mediated events would be favored since these are
thought to require the releaseof largeamounts of GABA (Dutar
and Nicoll, 1988). The resulting Cl-- and K+-mediated hyperpolarization, and subsequentdeinactivation of IT, may be a
critical factor in rhythm initiation and/or maintenance.
Here we present results of a voltage-clamp study in acutely
isolated neurons of rat nRt showing that these cells possessa
transient Ca2+current with unique properties. Unlike the transient (low-voltage-activated or T-type) current observed in a
number of preparationsincluding relay neurons,ITSin nRt neurons displays slow and voltage-independent inactivation kinetics. Thus, nRt cellscan generatelonger-duration LTSs and spike
bursts that result in a sustainedreleaseof GABA onto TCs.

Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal
days 7-12) were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital(50
mg/kg) and
decapitated, and the brain was rapidly removed and placed in chilled
oxygenated Ringer’s solution. Coronal slices with a thickness of 400 pm
were then cut on a vibratome. For current-clamp recordings, slices were
placed in interface-type chamber and perfused with normal Ringer’s
solution (see below) eauilibrated with 95% 0,. 5% CO, at 34°C.
Neurons of the ventrobasal complex (VB) and nRt were isolated from
slices via an enzymatic dissociation procedure that has been previously
described (Kay and Wong, 1986; Coulter et al., 1989a). In slices from
the most anterior coronal sections containing nRt, the nucleus was
relatively wide, and it was possible to resect it from adjacent ventrolateral nucleus and the internal capsule. The nRt sections were crescent
shaped rather than rectangular as in VB, but otherwise the dissociation
technique was identical for the two nuclei. The voltage-clamp data
presented here represent results from 43 nRt and 56 VB neurons.

the followmg procedure was used. Ai 8-d-old rat pup was deeply anes:
thetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg), followed immediately
by a transcardiac perfusion with 50 ml of 0.9% NaCl and 200 ml of
freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer. The brain was removed and stored overnight at 4°C
in the same fixative. The next day, the brain was transferred to PBS
and slices of 500 urn were cut usina a vibratome. The VB and nRt
thalamic nuclei were then dissected f;om the slices in the same manner
in which they are prepared for the dissociation procedure. The tissue
was embedded in agar, and serial vibratome sections with a nominal
thickness of 50 pm were cut. The sections were then processed for
immunocytochemistry
using a rabbit anti-GABA serum (Incstar Co.)
as follows. Free-floating sections were incubated in 95% EtOH for 3
min. followed bv several rinses in PBS. incubation in blocking solution
for 1 hr (5% no&nal goat serum, 0.3% T&on-X
in 0.1 M PBS), and
finally by incubation in the primary antiserum at a dilution of 1:6000
for 16 hr at 4°C. Sections were then rinsed several times both before
and after a 1 hr incubation in the biotinylated secondary antibody. After
several rinses in PBS, the sections were incubated for 45 min in the
avidin-biotin-peroxidase
complex, reacted with diaminobenzidine
solution in Tris buffer with 0.002% H,O,, and finally mounted on slides,
dried, and coverslipped.
For the isolated cells, the above procedure was slightly modified. Petri
dishes containing isolated cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.3% glutaraldehyde, followed by two 10 min rinses in PBS

and then 1 hr of incubation in a blocking solution of 3% normal goat
serum, 0.1% Triton-X in PBS. After rinsing in PBS, cells were exposed
to the 1” antibody, rat anti-GABA (Incstar; 1:6000), for 12 hr at 4°C
rinsed twice in PBS, and exposed for 45 min to the biotinylated 2”
antibody. Following two more rinses in PBS, the tissue was incubated
for 45 min in the avidin-biocytin-peroxidase
complex. Finally the cells
were rinsed with 50 mM Tris buffer, incubated with diaminobenzidine
solution in Tris buffer with 0.002% H,O,, rinsed again in Tris buffer,
and mounted using glycerol.
To identify the neurons in whole-cell recordings from the slice, 0.5%
biocytin was included in the intracellular patch pipette solution. Following recording, the slices were immediately fixed and processed using
published histochemical procedures (Tseng et al., 199 1).
Solutions and drugs. The concentration of solutions used for recording
I, in isolated cells was (in mM), for intracellular pipette solution, 110
Tris PO, dibasic, 28 Tris base, 11 ethyleneglycol-bis-(fi-aminoethylether)-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 2 MgCl,, 0.5 CaCl,, 4 Na, ATP,

Cl
(TEA). 3 CaCl,. 10 N-2-hvdroxvethvlninerazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic
acid
(HEPES), with’pH 7.4. Transient Ca-2+acurrents were quite stable under
these recording conditions; however, the sustained Ca2+ current tended
to run down unless an ATP regeneration system (see Forscher and
Oxford, 1985) was included in the intracellular solution. This resulted
in much more stable sustained Ca*+ current amplitude, so it was possible
to test reliably for reversible drug-dependent effects on this current as
well. In all cases, drug effects were compared to temporally proximate
controls to detect any remaining change in currents due to drift or
rundown. Drugs were applied via an extracellular perfusion system consisting of an assembly of several parallel tubes (Yellen, 1982) that could
be repositioned to effect complete solution changes in less than 1 sec.
Chemicals were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), except w-conotoxin GVIA (w-CgTx; Peninsula Labs, Belmont, CA) and dihydropyridines (compliments of Dr Alexander Scriabine, Miles Labs, West Haven, CT). All experiments were performed at room temperature (2325°C) to promote long-term survival (in some cases, >2 hr) of isolated
cells in the recording chamber.
For whole-cell recording in the slice, the following solutions were used
(in mM): extracellular Ringer’s solution, 122 NaCl, 26 NaHCO,, 1.2
NaH,PO,, 2 MgCl,, 2 CaCl,, 3 KCl, 10 glucose; intracellular solution,
135 K-gluconate, 1 MgCl,, 1 CaCl,, 11 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3.
Datacollection and analysis. Current-clamp recordings were obtained
via blind whole-cell recordinas (Blanton et al., 1989: Otis et al., 1991)
in thalamic slices using an Axopatch amplifier. Access resistance was
on the order to 10-20 MB. For voltage-clamp experiments in isolated
cells, whole-cell recordings (Hamill et al., 198 1) were obtained with
electrodes fabricated from medium-wall borosilicate glass (KG-33, Garner Glass, Claremont, CA). Typical electrode resistance was 5-6 MB in
the bath, with access resistance in the range of 7-12 MQ. Recordings
were obtained with a List EPC-7 amplifier, and series resistance compensation (~80%) was routinely utilized. Currents were leak subtracted,
using a P/4 protocol, and digitally sampled using an INDEC Basic-23
system. Nonlinear simplex routines were used to obtain best-fitted
Boltzmann (Eq. 1) and m2h (Eq. 2) curves. A 9 mV liquid junction
potential was subtracted from all command potentials. Cell capacitance
was determined by integrating the current response to a 5 mV hyperpolarization and then dividing the resultant charge by the change in
voltage.
The voltage protocols that were used for the pharmacological tests
(see Figs. 8,9; Table 2) were designed to isolate T-current and L-current.
Depolarizations to -40 mV from a holding potential of - 100 mV
activate only T-current, since this is below the activation threshold for
Z, and IN (Fox et al., 1987), while depolarizations to + 10 mV from a
holding potential of -50 mV should activate both Z, and IN. However,
thalamic cells possess little N-current (see Figs. 3, 8, 9; see also Coulter
et al., 1989a), and so this protocol activates essentially IL, since both IT
and ITS are inactivated at this holding potential (see Fig. 4).

actions. For example, during rhythmic LTS bursting in rat nRt
neurons, membrane hyperpolarization uncovers repetitive excitatory postsynaptic potentials that occur during the rhythmic
depolarizations in TCs (Shosakuet al., 1989). In order to compare LTS morphology directly within the two nuclei and to
support the suggestionthat the some of the differencesare dependent on intrinsic membraneproperties,we obtained currentclamp recordings in preparations containing both nRt and VB
within the sameslice. Examples of the LTSs in each cell type
are shown in Figure 1. In each cell type, depolarizing intracellular current pulsesdelivered from the resting potential (-72
to -82 mV) evoked responsesconsisting of a burst of action
potentials riding on a slow underlying LTS. These bursts had
distinctive and stereotypedproperties. For example, in nRt cells
(Fig. 1, top left), the LTS was prolonged so that six or seven
high-frequency (> 250 Hz) Na+ spikesweregeneratedat its crest.

In contrast, the LTSs in the relay neurons of VB (Fig. 1, top
right) were shorter in duration and evoked only 1 or 2 Na+
spikes.The remainder of this report focuseson differencesin
the underlying transient Caz+ currents that contribute to the
distinct burst characteristics in these two cell types.
Iderbjication of nRt cells
We compared transient Ca2+current properties of nRt and the
prototypical TCs of VB in each animal. Since these nuclei are
adjacent, the following measureswere used to ensurethat isolated cellswere derived from the desirednucleus.First, in a few
experimentsthe subdivided nuclear sectionswere testedfor the
presenceof GABA using standard immunohistochemical procedures.As expected, the tissuechunks isolated from nRt (Fig.
2A, top right) contained many GABA-positive neurons connectedvia a densenetwork of darkly stainingfibers, more clearly

but nRt burstscontain
more spikes that arise from a longer-duration LTS. Recording solution was potassium gluconate with 0.5% (w/v) biocytin. After recording, the
slice was processed and visualized with dark-field microscopy and is shown in the photomicrograph at the bottom(magnification, 200x). The
photomicrograph is a montage of two adjacent sections in register, as necessitated by the fact that the resectioning procedure resulted in the main
soma sections of the VB and nRt being located in adjacent 80 pm sections.

seenin Figure 2B (top). The round somata in nRt were very
darkly stained. In contrast, VB sections contained very few
GABA-positive cells(seeJones, 1985; Harris and Hendrickson,
1987); rather, a diffuse projection of fine, darkly staining fibers,
which delineated the barreloids (Jones, 1985) was observed in
the somatosensoryVB (Fig. 2A, bottom). GABA-positive cells
were rare (Fig. 2A, bottom), small, and normally monopolar or
bipolar in appearance(e.g., small monopolar cell in the lower
right corner of Fig. 2B, bottom).
Thalamic neuronscould be immunocytochemically identified
even after isolation. Cells acutely dissociated from nRt were
intensely stained (Fig. 2C, top), generally had round somata,
and possessed
one or two major dendrites. Only rare GABApositive cellswere found in preparations isolatedfrom VB (Fig.

2C, bottom right), although small (~2 Mm), dark puncta, possibly representingsevered terminals from GABAergic nRt cell
projections, were observed on the surfaceof the triangular somata of VB neurons. We were unsuccessfulin obtaining unambiguousimmunostaining following patch-clamp recordings.
However, given the relatively clean separation of nuclei, demonstrated by the above immunohistochemical control experiments, we are confident that the results presentedhere reflect
the properties of two different and relatively homogeneouspopulations of neurons.

lectively expressed,to determine whether someof the physiological differencesbetween relay neuronsand cellsof nRt could
be due to differencesin Ca2+channels.When patch electrodes
were filled with Tris-phosphate and the extracellular medium
contained TEA with 3 mM CaCl,, all voltage-dependent currents evoked between -80 and +30 mV were Ca2+dependent
asjudged by complete blockade with 1 mM extracellular Cd*+
or 0.1 mM La3+(seebelow). The addition of TTX to the bathing
solution produced no alteration in Ca2+current, demonstrating
that, in contrast to hippocampalneurons(Takahashiet al., 1989)
no Ca2+flux occurs through Na+ channelsin thalamic cells.
In many ways, the inward Ca*+ currents of nRt cells were
similar to thosein TCs. Small depolarizations, in the membrane
potential (V,) range of - 30 to -40 mV, evoked rapidly activating CaZ+ currents that completely inactivated with maintained depolarization (Fig. 3A). There wasno detectablecurrent
when the samedepolarizing commandswere applied with the
holding potential reduced from - 1OOmVto - 50 mV. Thus, in
nRt neurons,asin TCs, Z, is largely inactivated at normal resting
potentials. Although a T-type current was present in each cell
type, there were significant differencesbetween IT in nRt cells
and TCs. At command potentials of -30 and -40 mV, the Z,
was completely inactivated within about 110 msecin VB cells,
compared to nearly 220 msecin nRt (Fig. 3B). In addition, the
rate ofZTinactivation in VB cellswasvoltage dependent(Coulter
et al., 1989a), such that the time constant of current decay
becameshorter with stronger depolarizations (right traces, Fig.
3B). By contrast, the rate of decay of T-current in nRt cellswas
insensitive to membrane potential. Also, in nRt both the apparent activation threshold (-40 mV; Fig. 3C) and the potential
at which the current attained peak amplitude (- 10 mV) were
more depolarized than in VB cells (-50 mV and -30 mV,
respectively). Finally, peak IT amplitude was larger in VB cells
(280 f 23 pA, y1= 26) than in those of nRt (131 +- 15 pA, n

= 23; two-tailed t test, p < 0.001). The differences in peak
amplitude cannot be accounted for by cell size, sincemembrane
area, as estimated by whole-cell capacitance,was not different
between VB and nRt cells (16.7 f 1.1 pF, iz = 21, vs 17.1 +_
1.2 pF, n = 19, respectively).
In a subpopulation of nRt cells (16 out of 43) the kinetic
properties of the transient Ca*+ current were indistinguishable
from those of IT as seenin VB cells. It is possiblethat these
results either were from a true subpopulation of nRt cells, or
were due to contamination from nearby TCs, resulting from
incomplete microdissection. With preparations obtained from
the most anterior sectionsof thalamus, where it was possible
to isolate nRt more completely, only cells with the slow Tcurrent were obtained. However, there are anatomical data
(Spreafico et al., 1988) that support the existenceof more than
one subtype of nRt cell. Therefore, it remains a distinct possibility that there is heterogeneity of IT within nRt. Interestingly,
the two forms of Z, were mutually exclusive, that is, within a
given cell only one type of transient Ca*+ current existed.
of I,
There are somesimilarities between ITSdescribedhere and the
N-type current (IN) asdescribedin sensoryneurons (Fox et al.,
1987) especially in terms of inactivation rate. However, there
are clear distinctions between Zr and IN regarding the voltage
dependenciesof both activation and inactivation. IN is activated
by large depolarizations in the range of -20 mV to -t-30 mV,
whereasZ, is activated between -70 and -30 mV (Fox et al.,
1987).On the other hand, IT is steady-stateinactivated between
- 100 and -60 mV while IN is inactivated between - 100 and
- 30 mV. In a set of experiments designedto identify and characterize Z,, and differentiate it from Z,, we studied the voltage
dependenceof activation and inactivation in nRt cellsand compared theseproperties to those of Z, in VB neurons.

curve is the average activation
curve for VB neurons with P’, = -59 mV and k = -5.2 mV-I.
Voltage-dependentactivation of I,
Since calcium currents are not characterized by a true reversal
potential, it is not practical to obtain normalized activation
curves by plotting conductance(current divided by driving force)
versus voltage. An alternate approach is to step depolarize to
command potentials in the activation range for ITSand, at a
fixed latency near peak current, repolarize to a hyperpolarized
potential outside the activation range, and then measuretail
current amplitude. The currents thus obtained reflect the channels activated during the depolarization, and sincethe tail potential is fixed, currents can be normalized to maximum and
plotted versus command potential to generate an activation
curve. To study ITSin nRt cells, 30 msecdepolarizing commands
were applied and tail currents were obtained at -80 mV (Fig.
54). The most depolarized commands produced nearly overlapping tail currents, indicating that activation was at or near
saturation. With further depolarizations, tail currents were contaminated by IL, so it was not possibleto obtain maximal activation of ITSin isolation. In Figure 5B, upright triangles represent normalized tail current amplitude for the cell in Figure
5A, and the continuous line is the best-fitted squaredBoltzmann
curve (Eq. l), with k = -8.4 mV-I, K,?= -49 mV, and N =
2. The activation of ITSwas nearly complete at -20 mV, which
further differentiates it from IN. Activation of Z=in VB cells,
measuredwith the sameprotocol, occurred at significantly less
depolarized levels (Fig. 5A, inset; B, discontinuous line; Table

Steady-stateinactivation was investigated with standardprotocols. The holding potential was set to -60 mV, and depolarizations to - 30 mV were repeatedat regular intervals (10 set).

evidencethat a singlepopulation of channelsunderliesthe wholecell current. Current amplitude, normalized to maximum, is

different between the two cell types, but showedthat the slope
is slightly steeperfor IT than for ITS(Table 1). Thus, by this
criterion, ITSis much more similar to IT than to IN.

Evoked current decay curves, plotted on a semiloggraph, were
parallel (Fig. 64 inset), indicating that the inactivation time
constant, rh, was nearly independent of membranepotential in
the range of -60 to -20 mV (open symbols, Fig. 60). This
contrasts sharply with the values for VB neurons (Fig. 60, discontinuous line), which are highly voltage dependent,decreasing
from 60 to 30 msec in the samevoltage range. The time- and
voltage-dependent process of recovery from inactivation (or
deinactivation), which controls the return of availability of
channels subsequentto inactivation and is thus an important
factor in determining the rate of repetitive LTS generation in
TCs (Llinas and Jahnsen,1982; Coulter et al., 1989a),wasquite

6A, and deactivation rate was obtained by fitting a single exponential decay curve to the tail currents. SinceZ,, inactivation

Barium as a charge carrier for I,
For many L- or high-voltage-activated (HVA) type Ca*+ channels, BP+ is a more permeant charge carrier than Caz+, so

currents are significantly larger when Ba*+ is used(Fedulova et
al., 1985;Carboneand Lux, 1987a,b,Fox et al., 1987).However,
for T-currents, peak amplitude tends to be either comparable
or slightly smaller when Ca*+ is replaced with Ba*+ (Fedulova
et al., 1985; Carbone and Lux, 1987a,b; Fox et al., 1987). In
nRt cells, substitution of 3 mM [Ba*+lo for [Ca*+], resulted in
significantly larger ZTs(Fig. 7A, Table 2). At all potentials between -40 and 0 mV, ZBawas greater than I,, but there was
little changein the kinetics of the current. In contrast, the transient current in VB cells was reduced by Ba*+ at potentials
between -40 and 0 mV, and was slightly enhancedat - 50 mV
(Fig. 78). In addition, the rate of IT. decay in VB cells was
increasedin BaZ+(Fig. 7B). Since ZTdecay rate is voltage dependent(i.e., becomesfaster with depolarization), thesefindings
are consistent with an presumedreduction in the transmembrane electric field resulting from lesseffective screeningcharge
(Frankenhaeuserand Hodgkin, 1957) produced by Ba2+compared to Ca2+.The screeningcharge difference would result in
reduction in current amplitude by reducing the steady-state
availability of ZTchannels(seeFig. 6), and in fact the steady-

state inactivation curve was shifted by -6.6 f 0.9 mV (n = 7)
in the presenceof BaZ+. However, maximum IT amplitude was
still smaller with Ba*+ compared to Ca2+,even when all command potentials were hyperpolarized to compensate for this
shift (not shown;n = 3). Therefore, Z,, haspermeationproperties
that are more similar to Z, than to IT- Thesedifferencesin wholecell current may be due to various single-channelmechanisms
including higher channel conductanceor altered kinetic parameters such as higher open probability or open duration.
Pharmacology of I, in nRt versus VB cells
Apart from the kinetic differencesdiscussedabove, ITSin nRt
cells is similar to Z, in relay neurons since both are transient,
low-voltage-activated currents, but ITSalso shows some similarity to the “N’‘-current, sinceZ, activates at a higher threshold
than Z,, but showsslow inactivation (Fox et al., 1987).However,
a number of pharmacologicaldifferenceswere presentbetween
Z, and the slower currents (I, and I,; Fox et al., 1987)activated
with stronger depolarizations, which allows a clear differentiation between theseseparateconductances.For example, Z, and
IL are sensitive to blockade by Cd2+(Fox et al., 1987),but both
Z, and ITSwere relatively sparedby concentrations of Cd2+that
eliminated Z, in thalamic neurons(Fig. 8, Table 2). On the other
hand, Ni*+ (100-200 PM), which is a somewhatselectiveblocker
of Z,, produced similar reductions in ZTr,yet had smaller effects
on Z, (Fig. 8). Therefore, Z,, is more similar to Z, than to Z, in
terms of its sensitivity to divalent blockers. Another agent that
can be used to differentiate between various Ca2+ currents is
amiloride (Tang et al., 1988). At a concentration of 0.5 mM, it
reversibly blocked both Z, and I,,, but had little effect on IL in
either cell type (Fig. 8).
One of the hallmarks of N-current is sensitivity to w-CgTx.
This cone snail peptide toxin (Olivera et al., 1985) producesa
potent and irreversible block of N-type calcium current, and
may inhibit IL aswell (McCleskey et al., 1987). To differentiate
further between IT and IN, the applications of 0.5 PM w-CgTx
were tested and found to result in a rapid, partial, and irreversible block of Z, in both nRt and VB cells (Fig. 9), while Z,
and ITSwere unaffected in both cell types. Succinimide anticonvulsants produce a relatively selectiveblockade of Z, in VB cells
(Coulter et al., 1989b, 1990), and we therefore tested the effects
of one such agent on Ca2+currents in nRt. Methylphenylsuc-

cinimide (MPS; 3 mM; Fig. 9) reduced both Z, and Z,, by approximately 50% (Table 2), while Z, was reduced by only 25%.
Dihydropyridines, which are somewhatselective in their effects
on Z, (Fox et al., 1987; Takahashi and Akaike, 1991) were
relatively ineffective in depressingthe transient currents in thalamic cells.Nimodipine (Bay E9736; nominally 1 PM) produced
smallreversible reductions in L-current in both cell types (Table
2), while sparing I,. The small reductions (lo-15%) in “L”currents by either dihydropyridines or w-CgTx are similar to
the incomplete blockade seenin cerebellar Purkinje cells and
hippocampal CA1 neurons (Regan et al., 1991). The calcium
channel agonist Bay K8644 enhancedIL but not Z, in VB cells
(Table 2). However, its effectswere slightly lessselective in nRt
cells, where, in addition to the augmentation of IL, Bay K8644
produced a slight enhancement of ITS(114% of control; Table
2).
In isolated nRt cells, ITSwas quite stable, like IT in VB cells,
and unlike IL, which washesout during prolonged recording.
With the inclusion of the ATP regeneration system (seeMaterials and Methods) in the pipette solution, Z, becamelesslabile.
However, the amplitude of IL did typically increaseto a maximal
level during the first 5-10 min of recording and then gradually
wash out for the remainder of the experiment, while both ITS
and Z, maintained a fairly constant peak amplitude throughout
the recording. A further similarity between the two forms of IT
was that both were apparently insensitive to Ca*+-dependent
inactivation. While IT is relatively insensitive to intracellular
Ca*+ concentration (Carbone and Lux, 1987a), HVA currents
are reducedby either elevated [Ca2+],(Carboneand Lux, 1987a)
or reduced Ca2+-bufferingcapacity (Meyers and Barker, 1989).
Both IT and I,, persistedduring recordings made with [Caz+li
elevated to 0.5 PM, while IL waseither greatly reducedor absent
(n = 6). To summarize, the pharmacology and metabolic properties of ITSare very similar to IT and quite distinct from those
of Z, and I,.
Discussion
Identity of I,
BecauseITSwas larger in Ba*+ than Caz+and inactivated slowly
and in a voltage-independent manner, we considered that it
might be the sameas the N-current seenin chick dorsal root
ganglion (DRG) cells (Fox et al., 1987). However, nearly every

The Journal

test that we applied demonstrated that ITSwas a distinct current.
Whereas Z, is blocked by w-CgTx and Cd2+ (Fox et al., 1987)
Z,, was much less affected. The gating of ITSand IN is also different
in that the voltage range of activation of IN is broader and more
depolarized than for I,,, and steady-state inactivation of ITS
occurs at more negative potentials. Both Z, and IN appear to
depend on intracellular factors that “wash out” during wholecell recordings made without ATP in the patch electrode solution (Fedulova et al., 1985; Forscher and Oxford, 1985; Meyers
and Barker, 1989; Ryu and Randic, 1990), and HVA currents
are decreased when intracellular Ca*+ buffering is reduced (Carbone and Lux, 1987a,b; Meyers and Barker, 1989). By contrast,
ITSwas quite stable (like IT) during whole-cell recordings even
with elevated [Ca*+],. We conclude that ITS is not the same as
IN in the traditional sense. Furthermore, I,, is different from
two other voltage-gated CaZ+ currents, I, (Carbone and Lux,
1987a; Fox et al., 1987) and IP (Llinas et al., 1989) in that these
currents are activated at higher thresholds and are only very
slowly inactivating.
On the other hand, there were similarities between IT in relay
neurons and Z,, in neurons of the nRt. Both currents were selectively blocked by Ni2+, amiloride, and MPS and were resistant to w-CgTx and dihydropyridines.
In addition, steady-state
inactivation properties were similar. However, I,, was not identical to Z, in that there were differences in voltage-dependent
activation, voltage-dependent inactivation rate, and Ba2+:Ca2+
permeability ratio. The voltage insensitivity of inactivation of
ITSstands in striking contrast to the voltage dependency of inactivation of macroscopic T-currents in cells from a diverse
group of other preparations (rat and chick DRG: Carbone and
Lux, 1987a,b; Fox et al., 1987; rat somatosensory thalamus:
Coulter et al., 1989a; rat cerebellum: Kaneda et al., 1990; rat
hippocampus: Takahashi et al., 199 1; guinea pig olfactory cortex: Constanti et al., 1985; rat sensorimotor cortex: Sayer et al.,
1990; neuroblastoma cells from mouse and man: Narahashi et
al., 1987; Carbone et al., 1990; fibroblasts: Chen and Hess, 1990;
pituitary gonadotrophs: Mason and Sikdar, 1989; canine cardiac
Purkinje cells: Hirano et al., 1989; guinea pig ventricular cells:
Droogmans and Nilius, 1989). Furthermore, in experiments
where permeation properties for IT have been analyzed, Ba is
either equally or less effective as a charge carrier than Ca (Bossu
et al., 1985; Fedulova et al., 1985; Carbone and Lux, 1987a,b,
Fox et al., 1987; Tsien et al., 1987; Droogmans and Nilius,
1989; Hirano et al., 1989; Carbone et al., 1990; Takahashi et
al., 199 1; but see Yoshii et al., 1988). These differences justify
designation of the transient Ca2+ current in nRt as a new subtype
of T-current that we have termed I,,.
The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the
macroscopic differences in ITSand IT will require single-channel
recordings. The inactivation rate of single T-channels is voltage
independent (Carbone and Lux, 1987b; Droogmans and Nilius,
1989; Chen and Hess, 1990), and the voltage-dependent decay
of ensemble macroscopic current is actually the result of a voltage-dependent channel opening step and a voltage-dependent
single-channel burst duration. The lack of voltage-dependent
macroscopic inactivation suggests that there are fundamental
differences in the gating properties of I,, compared to I,.
Functional implications
The unique properties of ITS have important consequences for
thalamic function. Because the rate of ITS inactivation is slow
(Th = 90 msec) and voltage independent, the resulting LTS, which

of Neuroscience,

serves as the generator potential for bursts of Na+ spikes, is less
self-limiting than in relay neurons, where the depolarization
induced by the LTS speeds inactivation of T-current. Thus,
spike bursts are relatively prolonged in nRt cells, and as a consequence large IPSPs with prominent K+-mediated GABA,
components will be produced in TCs. Intracellular recordings
in TCs have shown that deinactivation of T-channels requires
prolonged hyperpolarization (- 100 ms; Jahnsen and Llinh:
1984; Coulter et al., 1989a). Therefore, these large IPSPs, especially the K+-mediated components, would facilitate rebound
LTSs. Because of the reciprocal connections with cortex and
nRt, bursts in excitatory efferents from TCs to nRt and cortex
that result from such LTS generation can promote a reverberatory rhythm. Therefore, burst firing in nRt, mediated by I,,,
may be a critical factor in initiating intrathalamic and thalamocortical oscillations. Succinimide anticonvulsants,
which
block Z, in VB neurons (Coulter et al., 1989b, 1990), are also
effective in reducing ITSin nRt. These two cellular actions may
contribute to the clinical efficacy of these agents in petit ma1
epilepsy. Since burst firing in nRt is thought to be critical for
thalamocortical synchronization, reduction in burst firing through
blockade of I,, would be expected to have antiepileptic effects.
The results of in vivo experiments support of this hypothesis.
Ethosuximide, a compound in the succinimide class, reduces
burst firing frequency and increases tonic firing in nRt at the
cellular level, while at the same time reducing both intrathalamic
and thalamocortical synchronization at the circuit level (Pellegrini et al., 1989).
The smaller amplitude of I,, and higher voltage for activation
might reduce the likelihood of obtaining an LTS in nRt cells
compared to TCs; however, input resistance tends to be higher
in nRt neurons (McCormick
and Prince, 1986) than in TCs,
and this may counter both effects. The rate of deinactivation of
I,, is relatively slow (time constant - 600 msec at -90 mV,
23°C; Fig. 60). If we assume a temperature coefficient of 3
(Coulter et al., 1989a), the resultant time constant would be
approximately 135 msec at 37°C. This would be sufficiently
rapid to allow significant (52-65%) recovery of ZTr within the
intraspindle frequency (7-10 Hz), and thus maintain a prolonged rhythm.
Since the rate of activation of ITS is somewhat slower than
that for I, (Fig. 6C), the current will peak later in nRt cells than
in TCs. This may partially explain the acceleration in spike
frequency within the early portions of nRt bursts seen in vivo
(Domich et al., 1986; Pellegrini et al., 1989), since maximal
frequency should occur near the time of peak I,, activation. The
slowing of spike frequency observed late in the burst in vivo
(Domich et al., 1986) is probably due to the slow inactivation
of ITS. This same burst pattern (early acceleration followed by
late deceleration) can also be observed in vitro, although this is
not clearly shown in the compressed time base of Figure 1.
Interestingly, since ITSactivates at more depolarized levels than
Z, (Fig. 5B), in the absence of confounding differences in other
ionic conductances, the threshold for LTSs should then be relatively depolarized in nRt.
One prediction from these findings (see Fig. 7) is that BaZ+
substitution for Ca*+ should produce conditions whereby burst
firing is selectively promoted in nRt compared to relay nuclei
within thalamic slices because ITSwould be enhanced while Z,
is inhibited. This effect would be somewhat complicated by the
effects of Ba z+ on CaZ+ channel inactivation (Fedulova et al.,
1985; Carbone and Lux, 1987a; Meyers and Barker, 1989) and

K+ channel blockade (Kmjevic
et al., 1971). However, given
the marked enhancement
of ITS by Ba*+ (-200%
increase; see
Fig. 7), cell-specific differences should still be apparent.
The results of this comparison
of T-current
in nRt and VB
provide further evidence supporting the hypothesis that neurons
with different functional roles within a circuit are likely to have
different biophysical
properties, determined
at least in part by
quantitative
and/or qualitative differences in voltage-dependent
ion channels. For example, many interneurons
in the hippocampus and neocortex are capable of firing at higher frequencies

cells (Schwartzkroin
and Mathers, 1978; McCormick et al., 1985), an observation
that can be explained in
part by both the lack of A-current
(Hamill et al., 1991) and
Ca*+-dependent
afterpotentials
(McCormick
et al., 1985) in intemeurons. Deciphering
the functional implications
of the large
numbers of diverse channel subtypes described in recent studies
(e.g., K+: Rudy, 1988; Reinhart et al., 1989; Stiiihmer
et al.,
1989; Na+: Noda et al., 1986; Auld et al., 1988; Trimmer
and
Agnew, 1989; Ca*+: Miller,
1987; Hui et al., 1991; Snutch et
al., 199 1) may seem an overwhelming
task. However, data such
as those presented here suggest that, when other variables such
as the neurons’ receptor subtypes, transmitter
phenotype, and
position in the circuit are taken into account, even subtle differences between channel species can be shown to have a clear
functional role within the rich fabric of the brain.

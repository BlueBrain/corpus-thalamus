Abstract
Ca2+ -dependent inactivation of Ca2+ channels represents a feedback mechanism to limit the influx of Ca2+ into cells. Since large Ca2+
transients are present in thalamocortical relay neurons and Ca2+ -dependent mechanisms play a pivotal role for thalamic physiology, the existence of this inactivation mechanism and the involvement of different Ca2+ channel subtypes was investigated. The use of subtype-specific
antibodies revealed the expression of ␣1A–␣1E channel proteins on the cell body and proximal dendrites of acutely isolated cells from
the rat dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). In addition, subtype-specific channel blocking agents were used in whole cell patch clamp
experiments: nifedipine (1–5 ␮M; L-type) blocked 35 ± 3%, ␻-conotoxin GVIA (1 ␮M; N-type) blocked 27 ± 8%, and ␻-conotoxin
MVIIC (4 ␮M; P/Q-type) blocked 33 ± 5% of the total HVA Ca2+ current. The blocker-resistant current constituted about 12 ± 3% of
the total Ca2+ current. The degree of Ca2+ current inactivation was assessed by using a two-pulse protocol. Under control conditions the
post-pulse I/V was U-shaped with 35 ± 4% of the current undergoing inactivation. Inclusion of BAPTA to the internal pipette solution
reduced the degree of inactivation to 15 ± 1%. When L- and P/Q-type current was blocked, the degree of inactivation was lowered to
20 ± 2 and 27 ± 3%, respectively. In the presence of ␻-agatoxin TK (35 ± 6%) and ␻-conotoxin GVIA (32 ± 1%) there was no change in
inactivation. These data suggest that Ca2+ -dependent inactivation is involved in the fine tuning of Ca2+ entry into relay neurons mediated
by L- and Q-type channels locally operated by Ca2+ beneath the plasma membrane. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Thalamic relay neurons possess both low-voltage activated (LVA) and high-voltage activated (HVA) Ca2+ currents
(Hernandez-Cruz and Pape, 1989). LVA channels have been
well characterized and their involvement in physiological
sleep oscillations and pathophysiological epileptic activity
has been recognized for a long time (Huguenard, 1996). LVA
Ca2+ channels are activated by depolarization from hyperpolarized membrane potentials and trigger bursts of action
potentials (Llinas and Jahnsen, 1982; McCormick and Bal,
1997). During wakefulness thalamic relay neurons are depolarized and LVA Ca2+ channels are inactivated (McCormick
and Bal, 1997; Steriade, 1991). Under these conditions thalamic relay neurons fire tonic sequences of Na+ /K+ -mediated
action potentials accompanied by the activation of solely
HVA Ca2+ currents. This activity mode allows the faithful
transfer of sensory information from the periphery to the
cerebral cortex (relay mode). However, only little is known

about HVA Ca2+ channels and their role in thalamic physiology. Studies combining electrophysiological and Ca2+
imaging techniques revealed strong increases in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration following HVA Ca2+ current activation (Munsch et al., 1997; Pedroarena and Llinas, 1997;
Zhou et al., 1997). Only very recently it has been shown that
HVA Ca2+ currents support the relay mode of thalamic relay neurons by inducing release of Ca2+ from intracellular
stores (Budde et al., 2000). Since an excessive increase in
the intracellular Ca2+ concentration is harmful to most cell
types (Choi, 1994), relay neurons are expected to possess
mechanisms restricting the entry of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm.
A classical negative feedback mechanism between Ca2+ entry and intracellular Ca2+ concentration is provided by the
Ca2+ -dependent inactivation of Ca2+ currents (Brehm and
Eckert, 1978). The precise mechanism whereby Ca2+ entry
mediates the inactivation of Ca2+ channels is not known.
Evidence for the existence of multiple mechanisms including activation of calmodulin (Lee et al., 1999; Peterson et al.,
1999; Zühlke et al., 1999), channel dephosphorylation (Armstrong, 1989), endogenous Ca2+ buffering (Nagerl et al.,
2000), and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton (Galli and
DeFelice, 1994) has been presented.

Neurons generally have several types of HVA Ca2+ currents (for review see: Catterall, 1998; Striessnig, 1999).
On the single cell level, they can be distinguished most
clearly by their pharmacology and immunoreactivity. CNS
neurons typically have L-type (␣1 subunit isoforms: ␣1C,
␣1D, ␣1S, ␣1F; selective blocker: dihydropyridines), N-type
(␣1B; ␻-conotoxin GVIA), P/Q-type (␣1A; ␻-conotoxin
MVIIC, ␻-agatoxin TK), and R-type (␣1E; SNX-482) Ca2+
channels. All types of currents have been shown to exist in
relay neurons of the ventrobasal thalamic complex (Kammermeier and Jones, 1997). HVA Ca2+ channel types that
have been demonstrated to display Ca2+ -dependent inactivation are L-, N-, and P/Q-type channels (De Leon et al.,
1995; Lee et al., 1999; Zeilhofer et al., 2000).
The present study was undertaken to evaluate the existence of Ca2+ -dependent inactivation in thalamic relay neurons, and to identify the channel subtypes mediating this
mechanism.

2. Methods and techniques
2.1. Preparation
Long Evans rats (postnatal days 12–20) were deeply
anaesthetized with halothane and decapitated. A block of
tissue containing the rat dorsolateral geniculate nucleus
(dLGN) was removed and placed in ice cold saline, containing (mM): sucrose, 210; PIPES, 20; KCl, 2.4; MgCl2 ,
10; CaCl2 , 0.5; dextrose, 10; pH 7.25 with NaOH. Thalamic slices including the dLGN were prepared as coronal
sections on a vibratome (Model 1000, Ted Pella, Redding, CA, USA). dLGN tissue was transferred to a spinner
flask, warmed stepwise from 5 to 30◦ C, and incubated for
25–30 min at 30◦ C in an oyxgenated solution containing
trypsin (0.5–1 mg/ml, Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) and
(mM): NaCl, 120; KCl, 5; MgCl2 , 3; CaCl2 , 1; PIPES, 20;
dextrose, 25; pH adjusted to 7.35 with NaOH. After washing with enzyme-free solution, slices were allowed to cool
down to room temperature. Single neurons were dissociated
by triturating a slice with a series of fire polished Pasteur
pipettes of decreasing tip diameter.
2.2. Electrophysiology
Isolated thalamic cells were placed under an inverted
microscope (Axiovert 135, Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and allowed to settle down for 20 min and perfused with a HEPES
buffered solution containing (mM): NaCl, 135; KCl, 2;
HEPES, 10; dextrose, 15, d-mannitol, 15; MgCl2 , 3; CaCl2 ,
2; pH 7.35 with NaOH. Whole-cell recordings were performed at room temperature (21–23◦ C) using borosilicate
glass pipettes (GC150TF-10, Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, UK) connected to an EPC-7 amplifier
(List Medical Systems, Darmstadt, Germany). Typical electrode resistance was 2–5 M , with access resistance in the

range 3–8 M . Series resistance compensation >40% was
routinely used. Voltage clamp experiments were governed
by pClamp software, operating via an interface (Digidata
1200, both from Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA)
on an IBM AT computer. If not stated otherwise the holding
potential was set to −50 mV. In order to record membrane
calcium currents, the following solutions were used: (i)
extracellular solution (mM): NaCl, 112; CsCl, 4; KCl, 1;
HEPES, 10; dextrose, 10, MgCl2 , 1; CaCl2 , 5.0; TTX,
0.001; TEA-Cl, 20; 4-AP, 6; pH 7.35 with NaOH; (ii) intracellular solution: Cs-gluconate, 85; Cs3 -citrate, 10; NaCl,
10; KCl, 1; EGTA, 1.1; CaCl2 , 0.1; MgCl2 , 0.25; HEPES,
10; TEA-Cl, 15; Mg-ATP, 3; Na2 -GTP, 0.5; pH 7.25 with
CsOH.
Data are given as mean ± S.E.M. Statistical significance
was tested using a modified t-test for small samples. The
time course of inactivation of inward currents was described
by approximating the current wave form to the function
I = A0 + A1 exp −

t
τ1

+ A2 exp −

t
τ2

+ ···

where amplitude coefficients and time constants of current
decay are A0 to An and τ 1 to τ n , respectively.
2.3. Drugs
Toxins (␻-agatoxin TK, ␻-conotoxin GVIA, ␻-conotoxin
MVIIC) were obtained from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem,
Israel). Nifedipine (N7634) was obtained from Sigma.
Drugs were delivered using a multi-barreled fast application
system.
2.4. Immunocytochemistry
Staining was performed using procedures modified from
that described previously (Budde and White, 1998). Neurons were isolated using a papain (1 mg/ml) based isolation procedure. Briefly, a suspension of isolated dLGN cells
was poured upon poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides and cells
were allowed to settle down for 1 h. Fixation was achieved
by incubating the cells in a phosphate-buffered physiological saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 0.4% glutare aldehyde
for 10 min. Endogenous peroxidases were inactivated by the
use of H2 O2 (0.3%, 20 min). Preincubation with normal goat
serum (Sigma, 1 h, 10% diluted in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100) was followed by the primary antiserum against
Ca2+ channel ␣1 subunits (␣1A–␣1E; Alomone Labs; 18 h
at RT, 1:200), the secondary antiserum of biotinylated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Labs, BA-5000, 1.5 h, 1:200), and
the avidin–biotin-complexed horseradish peroxidase (Vector
Labs, PK 4000, 1:100, 1.5 h). Between steps, slides were
rinsed three times in PBS. Antibodies were diluted in PBS
containing 2% goat normal serum, 0.3% Triton, 2% BSA.
Enzymatic activity of the peroxidase was started by adding
PBS containing 0.05% 3,3 -diaminobenzidine, 0.01% H2 O2 ,
0.02% (NH4 )2 Ni(SO4 )2 , and 0.025% CoCl2 resulting in an

S. Meuth et al. / Thalamus & Related Systems 1 (2001) 31–38

enhanced dark gray to black staining of positively labeled
neurons. The reaction was stopped after 10 min by infinite
dilution with PBS. Slides were dehydrated and coverslipped
in DePeX (Serva) mounting medium.
As a negative control, antibodies were preincubated with
the control antigen peptide supplied by the manufacturer.
Under these conditions no positive immunological signal
could be detected. In addition, occlusion of the primary
antibody from the staining procedure revealed no positive
immunological signal. For each subtype antibody reactions
were repeated four times.
3. Results
3.1. Identification of HVA Ca2+ current components in
dLGN relay neurons
The expression of different HVA Ca2+ channel proteins
in thalamic neurons was assessed by use of specific antibod-

33

ies (Westenbroek et al., 1998). Neurons were isolated from
the dLGN of 12–20 days old rats and only cells displaying a
preserved and clear morphology after the staining procedure
were used for analysis and 288–936 cells were inspected for
each Ca2+ channel subtype. Incubation of acutely isolated
dLGN neurons with an ␣1A-specific antiserum positively
stained all investigated cells. Using previously established
criteria local interneurons and relay neurons were identified
(Pape et al., 1994). Both types of cells were immunopositive (Fig. 1A). Very similar results were obtained by use of
antibodies specific for ␣1B (Fig. 1B), ␣1C (Fig. 1C), ␣1D
(Fig. 1C), and ␣1E (Fig. 1D). The relative number of relay
neurons and interneurons per object slide was 81 ± 2 and
19 ± 2% (n = 28), respectively. These data suggest that
there is no cell type-specific or isoform-specific expression
of HVA Ca2+ channels in rat dLGN neurons.
To determine that the expressed channel proteins were
functional, dLGN relay neurons (n = 57) were recorded under whole cell conditions after acute isolation. Using Ca2+

current traces recorded under control conditions and during application of current type specific blocker are plotted on the right of the images. The
corresponding blocker-sensitive component was achieved by digital subtraction for ␻-conotoxin MVIIC (VIIC-sens, A), ␻-agatoxin TK (TK-sens, A),
␻-conotoxin GVIA (VIA-sens, B), and nifedipine (nif-sens, C). The current resistant to simultaneous application of ␻-conotoxin MVIIC, ␻-conotoxin
GVIA, and nifedipine (resist) is shown in D. The scale bar in B and D corresponds to all current traces and cell images, respectively.

(Ca2+ /EGTA: τ1 = 84 ms, τ2 = 746 ms) and single-exponential (Ba2+ /BAPTA: τ = 1386 ms) fits to the current traces. Fits were shifted beneath current
traces for clarity. (B) Bar graph representation of inactivation time constants of inward currents recorded under control conditions (con) and in the
presence of the indicated blocker (abbreviations as in A). With Ca2+ as charge carrier two time constants of inactivation (τ 1 : black bars; τ 2 : gray bars)

as charge carrier and an intracellular recording solution with
a low Ca2+ buffering capacity (1.1 mM EGTA), depolarization from a holding potential of −50 to +10 mV resulted in
a rapidly activating inward current that notably inactivated
during a 1000–1200 ms pulse (Figs. 1 and 2Aa). To test for
the presence of L-type current, the effect of the dihydropyridine (DHP) antagonist nifedipine was examined. Nifedipine
(1–5 ␮M; n = 7) reduced the peak current amplitude of HVA
Ca2+ currents by 35±3% (Fig. 1C). The DHP-sensitive current component displayed a marked time dependent inactivation with τ1 = 56 ± 6 and τ2 = 726 ± 88 ms, respectively
(n = 7; Fig. 2Ab and B). The N-type specific Ca2+ current blocker ␻-conotoxin GVIA (1 ␮M) irreversibly inhibited 27±8% (n = 4; Fig. 1B) of the HVA Ca2+ current. The
␻-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive current followed a slow single
exponential process with τ = 530 ± 26 ms and displayed
only little time-dependent inactivation (n = 4; Fig. 2Ac
and B). Furthermore, 33 ± 5% (n = 4) of the total HVA
Ca2+ current was blocked by ␻-conotoxin MVIIC (4 ␮M),
indicating mediation by a P/Q-type current (Fig. 1A). The
␻-conotoxin MVIIC-sensitive current component displayed
a marked time dependent inactivation with τ1 = 72 ± 13
and τ2 = 1350 ± 26 ms, respectively (n = 4; Fig. 2Ad and
B). As the current sensitive to ␻-conotoxin MVIIC could be
either P- or Q-type, the funnel web spider toxin ␻-agatoxin
TK, a potent and selective P-type current blocker (Teramoto
et al., 1993; Dobrev et al., 1998), was used next. Application of 0.1 ␮M ␻-agatoxin TK blocked 15 ± 4% (n =
4) of the total HVA Ca2+ current, indicating that about
45% of the ␻-conotoxin MVIIC-sensitive current consisted

of P-type channels (Fig. 1A). The ␻-agatoxin TK-sensitive
component followed a single exponential time function τ =
700 ± 124 ms (n = 3; Fig. 2Ae and B). The R-type current
component which was resistant to simultaneous application
of nifedipine, ␻-conotoxin GVIA, and ␻-conotoxin MVIIC,
accounted for 12 ± 3% (n = 3) of the total HVA Ca2+
current and revealed only little time dependent inactivation
(Fig. 1D). The current followed a single exponential time
course with τ = 450 ± 65 ms (Fig. 2B).
To assess whether the time-dependent inactivation of HVA
current components was based on a Ca2+ -dependent mechanism, the blocker-specific currents were investigated after
prevention of Ca2+ -dependent inactivation by using BAPTA
(11 mM) as intracellular Ca2+ chelator and Ba2+ as main
charge carrier (2Aa). Under these conditions, the total HVA
Ca2+ current and blocker-sensitive current components were
typically increased in amplitude and inactivated much slower
(Fig. 2A and B). All blocker-sensitive currents inactivated
following a single exponential time course with τ = 1300 ±
52 ms (L-type; Fig. 2Ab and B), τ = 800±96 ms (P/Q-type;
Fig. 2Ad and B), and τ = 900 ± 114 ms (N-type; Fig. 2Ac
and B). The ␻-agatoxin TK-sensitive component was similar
during both recording conditions (Ca2+ : τ = 700 ± 124 ms,
Fig. 2Ae and B; Ba2+ : τ = 800 ± 45 ms; Fig. 2Ae and B).
R-type current could not be detected with Ba2+ as charge
carrier, probably due to the lower permeability of ␣1E channels for Ba2+ compared to Ca2+ (Bourinet et al., 1996).
These findings indicate that L- and Q-type Ca2+ currents
are the most likely candidates for a Ca2+ -dependent inactivation process.

Fig. 3. Identification of Ca2+ -dependent inactivation by means of two-pulse protocols. (A) Representative current traces (lower panel) evoked by the
indicated voltage protocol (upper panel) under control conditions (Aa) and BAPTA included to the recording pipette (Ab). A conditioning pre-pulse to
varying potentials (−40 to +50 mV, 200 ms duration) was followed by a brief gap (−50 mV, 50 ms) and a subsequent analyzing post-pulse (+10 mV,
200 ms) to assess the remaining inward current. Numbers indicate corresponding pre-pulse (1–3) and post-pulse ( – ) currents. Current traces with a
pre-pulse voltage of −40 (1); +10 (2); and +50 mV (3) are shown. (B) Current/voltage relationship (I/V) plots of currents evoked by two-pulse protocols
under control conditions (Ba) and BAPTA included to the recording pipette (Bb). Pre-pulse (filled squares) and post-pulse (open circles) I/V are shown.
Numbers correspond to the current traces in A.

To further confirm these findings, a voltage protocol
was used that effectively discloses Ca2+ -dependent inactivation (Fig. 3A). Conditioning pre-pulses of varying
potential (−40 to +50 mV, 200 ms duration) were applied
followed by a brief gap (−50 mV, 50 ms) and a subsequent
fixed post-pulse (+10 mV, 200 ms). The remaining HVA
Ca2+ current under control conditions (Fig. 3Aa) and with
BAPTA (11 mM) in the pipette solution (Fig. 3Ab) was
analyzed. If Ca2+ -dependent inactivation is operative, the
current evoked by the post-pulse should exhibit a U-shaped
dependence on the pre-pulse potential, with maximal inactivation occurring at the peak of the I/V relationship where
the influx of Ca2+ is maximal (due to normalization the
post-pulse I/V has an inverted U-shape in the present paper and is, therefore, referred as such in the following).
Under control conditions the pre-pulse I/V demonstrated
HVA Ca2+ currents with an activation threshold ≤−30 mV,
maximal inward current at around +10 mV, and apparent
reversal potential at around +50 mV (Fig. 3Ba, closed
squares; n = 17). The post-pulse I/V (post-pulse current
peak amplitude plotted versus pre-pulse voltage) was inverted U-shaped with minimal current occurring at +10 mV
(35 ± 4% reduction compared to the post-pulse current
evoked following a prepulse to −40 mV, n = 17; Figs. 2Ba
(open circles) and 4B), as expected for a Ca2+ -dependent
inactivation mechanism. The inverted U-shaped post-pulse

I/V was obtained with a pre-pulse at +50 mV followed by
10 mV decrements and a prepulse at −40 mV followed by
10 mV increments. With BAPTA included to the internal
pipette solution, time-dependent inactivation (Fig. 2B) and
inverted U-shape of the post-pulse I/V (Fig. 3Bb, open
circles) were substantially reduced. On average, the degree of inactivation was reduced to 15 ± 1% (n = 5;
Fig. 4B).
To further assess the contribution of different HVA Ca2+
current components to the degree of Ca2+ -dependent inactivation, two-pulse protocols were delivered in the presence of subtype-specific blockers. As expected from the
time-dependent inactivation of nifedipine-sensitive currents,
the inverted U-shape of the post-pulse I/V was most effected
by blocking L-type current. In the presence of 5 ␮M nifedipine the degree of inactivation was significantly reduced to
20 ± 2% (n = 5; Fig. 4Aa and B). These data indicated a
clear contribution of L-type channels to Ca2+ -dependent inactivation in dLGN relay neurons. P/Q-type channels also
contributed to Ca2+ -dependent inactivation, since addition
of ␻-conotoxin GVIIC to the extracellular solution resulted
in a significant reduction of the degree of inactivation to
27 ± 3% (n = 6; Fig. 4Ac and B). In the presence of
␻-agatoxin TK, the inverted U-shaped post-pulse I/V was
not significantly changed, revealing a degree of inactivation
of 35 ± 6% (n = 4; Fig. 4Ad and B). Similarly, when the

nifedipine (nif, a), ␻-conotoxin GVIA (VIA, b), ␻-conotoxin MVIIC (VIIC, c), and ␻-agatoxin TK (TK, d) are shown. (B) Bar graph representation
of the degree of inactivation found under control conditions (con) or in the presence of the indicated blocker (abbreviations as in A). The degree of
inactivation was given by the Inormalized values of the mean post-pulse I/V at +10 mV (‘**’ indicates P < 0.01).

N-type-specific blocker ␻-conotoxin GVIA was used, the
degree of inactivation was 32 ± 1% (n = 5), and not significantly different from control conditions (Fig. 4Ab and
B). When the blocker-resistant current was analyzed the degree of inactivation was reduced to 3.8 ± 0.8% (data not
shown), indicating that R-type current did not contribute to
Ca2+ -dependent inactivation.
To verify that the reduction of the degree of Ca2+ dependent inactivation by some of the Ca2+ channel blockers was not due to the decrease in Ca2+ current amplitude,
relay neurons were perfused with extracellular solutions
containing different Ca2+ concentrations. Changing the
extracellular Ca2+ concentration from 5 to 3 mM resulted
in a 30% reduction of the current amplitude at +10 mV
from 369 ± 62 to 261 ± 19 pA (n = 4; data not shown).
Despite this reduction in total current amplitude, the degree
of Ca2+ -dependent inactivation was 35 ± 2% (n = 4), and
therefore, not different from the degree of inactivation with
5 mM extracellular Ca2+ (35 ± 4%; n = 17). Furthermore,
the two time constants of inactivation (τ1 = 57 ± 9 and
τ2 = 628 ± 73 ms; n = 4) were very similar to the those
found with 5 mM extracellular Ca2+ (τ1 = 56 ± 6 and
τ2 = 726 ± 88 ms; n = 7).

4. Discussion
The present study was undertaken to investigate
Ca2+ -dependent inactivation of HVA Ca2+ currents in
dLGN relay neurons, and to identify the types of Ca2+
currents mediating this effect.

4.1. Pharmacological and immunocytochemical
characterization of Ca2+ channels
Our whole-cell patch-clamp studies of dLGN relay neurons demonstrated that these cells express Ca2+ channels
that are sensitive to dihydropyridines, ␻-conotoxin GVIA,
␻-agatoxin TK, and ␻-conotoxin MVIIC along with a current that was resistant to these agents. These findings are
consistent with the expression of ␣1A–␣1E subunits in
the cell body and proximal dendrites, as demonstrated by
the use of antibodies known to specifically label class A–E
␣1 subunits (Westenbroek et al., 1998): (1) the expression
of the ␣1A gene product was confirmed by the blocking
effect of the P/Q-type blocker ␻-conotoxin MVIIC and
the P-type blocker ␻-agatoxin TK (Teramoto et al., 1993;
Dobrev et al., 1998); (2) the reduction of HVA Ca2+ currents by ␻-conotoxin GVIA was well correlated with the
expression of ␣1B protein in the cell body of dLGN relay neurons; (3) the expression of ␣1C and ␣1D channels
is in agreement with the block of HVA Ca2+ currents by
nifedipine; (4) the expression of the ␣1E gene was corroborated by the presence of a current component resistant to all
standard blocking agents. These findings are in agreement
with previous investigations of Ca2+ channels in thalamic
neurons (for an overview see Table 1 in Kammermeier and
Jones, 1997; Pedroarena and Llinas, 1997).
4.2. Mechanism of inactivation
A number of criteria have been suggested that demonstrate the presence of Ca2+ -dependent inactivation: (1)

S. Meuth et al. / Thalamus & Related Systems 1 (2001) 31–38

Ca2+ -dependent inactivation should be influenced by the
charge carrier used, with Ca2+ being more effective than
Ba2+ . In the present study, the rate of inactivation was
significantly reduced when Ba2+ was used as charge carrier; (2) Ca2+ -dependent inactivation should be reduced
by introducing Ca2+ buffers via the patch pipette. Indeed,
inclusion of 11 mM BAPTA into the recording pipette resulted in a significant reduction of the inactivation rate
as well as the degree of inactivation measured in double
pulse experiments; (3) in double pulse experiments, the
degree of inactivation during the test pulse had an inverted
U-shaped dependence on the prepulse potential, displaying
a strong reduction as the prepulse potential approaches the
reversal potential of Ca2+ currents. Taken together these
findings clearly indicate the presence of a Ca2+ -dependent
inactivation mechanism in dLGN relay neurons.
The identification of the HVA Ca2+ channel subtypes involved in the Ca2+ -dependent inactivation process
was based on an analysis of the inactivation rate of the
blocker-sensitive current components and the degree of
inactivation measured in double pulse experiments when
Ca2+ channel blockers were present. The following lines of
evidence indicate that L- and Q-type currents are involved
in Ca2+ -dependent inactivation: (1) currents through HVA
channels were compared under conditions allowing (1.1 mM
EGTA intracellular, Ca2+ as charge carrier) or excluding (11 mM BAPTA intracellular, Ba2+ as charge carrier)
Ca2+ -dependent inactivation. Time constants of inactivation were calculated for both recording conditions. With
EGTA/Ca2+ , only L- and P/Q-type currents revealed two
time constants of inactivation, a prominent fast and a smaller
slow component. When BAPTA/Ba2+ was used the rate of
inactivation of all current components was reduced. Most noticeable was the complete block of the fast component of Land P/Q-type currents; (2) mere blockade of L- and P/Q-type
currents resulted in significant reduction of the inverted
U-shape of the postpulse I/V; (3) the use of ␻-agatoxin TK,
a selective P-type blocker, indicated that only the Q-type
component was involved in Ca2+ -dependent inactivation.
Two models of Ca2+ -dependent inactivation have previously been proposed (Sherman et al., 1990). In a shell
mechanism, inactivation is affected by the Ca2+ concentration in a macroscopic shell beneath the plasma membrane,
with the elevated Ca2+ concentration inactivating both open
and closed channels. In the domain mechanism, only open
channels interact with Ca2+ and thereby enter the inactivated state. Intracellular Ca2+ chelators should reduce the
inactivation in a shell operated mechanism, but will have
little effect on a domain model (Kay, 1991). In dLGN relay neurons both mechanisms seem to be operative: (1) the
finding that blockade of a main HVA current component
by ␻-conotoxin GVIA (N-type, ∼27%) and ␻-agatoxin TK
(P-type, ∼15%) did not change the inverted U-shape of the
inactivation curve, whereas blockade of other components
(∼35%, L-type current; P/Q-type, ∼33%) did, are in agreement with a domain model: only open channels that pos-

37

sess a Ca2+ -dependent inactivation mechanism interact with
Ca2+ passing the conducting pore and enter the inactivated
state. This interpretation is corroborated by the finding that
an overall reduction of the total HVA current by 30% by
lowering the extracellular Ca2+ concentration did not reduce
the degree or time course of inactivation; (2) the finding that
intracellular BAPTA substantially reduced inactivation, is in
agreement with a shell model (Kay, 1991). Two observations
may account for this duality: (a) modeling studies of neurotransmitter release suggest that simultaneous opening of
closely spaced Ca2+ channels near to a release site lead to
overlapping Ca2+ microdomains and an increased probability of Ca2+ -dependent vesicle fusion, a phenomenon termed
Ca2+ current cooperativity (Bertram et al., 1999); (b) L-type
channels are clustered at the somato-dendritic junction of
dLGN relay neurons (Budde et al., 1998). Therefore, simultaneous activation of closely spaced L-type channels may
result in an area of overlapping microdomains building up a
shell of increased Ca2+ concentration beneath the channel
cluster. Under these conditions individual L-type channels
will no longer determine their own rate of inactivation but
cooperativity is operative.
In most central neurons, N- and L-type channels are
mainly located in dendritic regions and somatic regions,
respectively (Westenbroek et al., 1992; Westenbroek et al.,
1998). Although the exact distribution of Ca2+ channels
in dLGN relay cells is not known, N- and L-type channels
may be located remote to each other not allowing an interference between Ca2+ entering via N-type channels and the
inactivation mechanism of L-type channels. Similar consideration may apply to the other Ca2+ channels with P/Q-type
located predominantly in dendrites and axon terminals and
R-type channels mainly present in the soma (Pedroarena
and Llinas, 1997; Westenbroek et al., 1998).
4.3. Functional significance of Ca2+ -dependent
inactivation
The functional role of HVA Ca2+ channels in the thalamus presently emerges from experimental data. HVA channels seem to be more important for thalamic activity during
wakefulness. A number of recent studies using imaging
techniques support this view. In addition to slow oscillations during sleep, thalamic relay neurons can also generate
high-frequency 40 Hz oscillations during wakefulness by
activating dendritic P/Q-type Ca2+ currents (Pedroarena and
Llinas, 1997). This type of oscillation may be involved in
generating visual attention and a temporal coincidence detection mechanism. Furthermore, it seems that the tonic firing mode of relay neurons, representing an important basis
for sensory information processing and transfer, relies on the
Ca2+ -dependent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores via
ryanodine receptors (Budde et al., 2000). This Ca2+ -induced
Ca2+ release mechanism is typically coupled to Ca2+ entry
via L-type channels in central neurons (Chavis et al., 1996).
Therefore, it seems that the two HVA Ca2+ current com-

38

ponents (namely L- and P/Q-type) with known functional
importance for cellular integrative processes in the thalamus
during wakefulness are also modulated by a Ca2+ -dependent
inactivation mechanism. One reason for the existence of this
mechanism may be the prevention of an excessive increase
of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration when these channels
are repetitively activated during 40 Hz oscillations or tonic
firing (see above). The necessity for a negative feed back
mechanism may be underlined by the recent finding that
L-type channels in relay neurons are facilitated by prolonged
depolarization (Kammermeier and Jones, 1998). The existence of opposing mechanisms regulating the flow of Ca2+
through L-type channels indicates a fine tuning of Ca2+
entry into thalamic relay neurons. Since both mechanisms
are expected to be mainly operative during the relay mode
of activity, the restriction of Ca2+ entry by Ca2+ -dependent
inactivation may not be solely neuroprotective but, in addition, essential for sensory information processing.

SUMMARY

1. The mechanisms of action of acetylcholine (ACh) in the medial (m.g.n.) and
dorsal lateral geniculate (l.g.n.d.) nuclei were investigated using intracellular recordings techniques in guinea-pig and cat in vitro thalamic slices.
2. Application of ACh to neurones in guinea-pig geniculate nuclei resulted in a
hyperpolarization in all neurones followed by a slow depolarization in 52 % of l.g.n.d.
and 46 % of m.g.n. neurones. Neither the hyperpolarization nor the slow depolarization were eliminated by blockade of synaptic transmission and both were activated
by acetyl-fl-methylcholine and DL-muscarine and blocked by scopolamine, indicating
that these responses are mediated by direct activation of muscarinic receptors on the
cells studied.
3. The ACh-induced hyperpolarization was associated with an increase in apparent
input conductance (Gi) of 4-13 nS. The reversal potential of the ACh-induced
hyperpolarization varied in a Nernstian manner with changes in extracellular [K+]
and was greatly reduced by bath application of the K+ antagonist Ba2+ or intracellular injection of Cs+. These findings show that the muscarinic hyperpolarization
is mediated by an increase in K+ conductance.
4. The ACh-induced slow depolarization was associated with a decrease in GC of
2-15 nS, had an extrapolated reversal potential near EK, and was sensitive to [K+]0,
indicating that this response is due to a decrease in K+ conductance.
5. In contrast to effects on guinea-pig geniculate neurones, applications of ACh to
cat l.g.n.d. and m.g.n. cells resulted in a rapid depolarization in nearly all cells,
followed in some neurones by a hyperpolarization and/or a slow depolarization. The
rapid excitatory response was associated with an increase in membrane conductance,
had an estimated reversal potential of -49 to -4 mV and may be mediated by
nicotinic receptors. The hyperpolarization and slow depolarization were similar to
those of the guinea-pig in that they were associated with an increase and decrease,
respectively, of Gi, and were mediated by muscarinic receptors.
6. The muscarinic hyperpolarization interacted with the intrinsic properties of the
thalamic neurones to inhibit single-spike activity while promoting the occurrence of
burst discharges. The muscarinic slow depolarization had the opposite effect; it

brought the membrane potential into the range where burst firing was blocked and
single-spike firing predominated. Depending upon the membrane potential, the rapid
excitatory response of cat geniculate neurones could activate either a burst or a train
of action potentials. These results further illustrate the mechanisms by which the
ascending cholinergic system may influence the transfer of neuronal information
through the thalamus.
INTRODUCTION

Ascending neurotransmitter systems of the brain stem have long been implicated
in the control of integrative activities of thalamic neurones (Moruzzi & Magoun,
1949; Steriade, 1970; Foote, Maciewicz & Mordes, 1974; Dingledine & Kelly, 1977;
Singer, 1977; Rogawski & Aghajanian, 1980). One putative neurotransmitter of
these ascending reticular systems is acetylcholine (ACh) (Dingledine & Kelly, 1977;
Singer, 1977; Francesconi, Muller & Singer, 1984; Kayama, Tagaki & Ogawa, 1986).
Immunohistochemical identification of the rate-limiting ACh synthesizing enzyme,
choline acetyltransferase (Chat), and histological stains for the ACh degradative
enzyme, acetylcholine esterase, reveal that parts of the thalamus receive a dense
cholinergic innervation (Kimura, McGeer, Peng & McGeer, 1981; Mesulam, Mufson,
Wainer & Levey, 1983; de Lima, Montero & Singer, 1985; Woolf & Butcher, 1986).
The origins of this cholinergic projection are not completely known, although the
pedunculopontine and lateral dorsal tegmental brain-stem nuclei are at least one
source (Mesulam et al. 1983; Woolf & Butcher, 1986). Recent electron microscopic
examination of fibres immunoreactive for Chat in the cat lateral geniculate and
perigeniculate nuclei show that these fibres form synaptic contacts with the dendrites
of both putative geniculocortical relay cells, and putative GABAergic neurones (de
Lima et al. 1985; Stichel & Singer, 1985). Both nicotinic and muscarinic cholinoceptors have been demonstrated in the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei by
autoradiography (Rotter, Birdsall, Burgen, Field, Hulme & Aisman, 1979; Clarke,
Schwartz, Paul, Pert & Pert, 1985).
lontophoretic applications of ACh to cat medial geniculate neurones in vivo cause
both inhibition and excitation (Tebecis, 1972), while applications to cat lateral
geniculate neurones typically cause only excitation (Phillis, 1971; Krnjevic', 1974;
Sillito, Kemp & Berardi, 1983; Eysel, Pape & Van Schayck, 1986). The ionic mechanisms of these actions of ACh in the geniculate nuclei are unknown. In other regions
of the nervous system, cholinergic excitation has been associated with a decrease in
specialized K+ conductances (Krnjevic, 1974; Adams & Brown, 1982; Benardo &
Prince, 1982; Halliwell, 1986; Madison, Lancaster & Nicoll, 1987) or an increase in
cation conductance (McCormick & Prince, 1986a, 1987), while cholinergic inhibition
can be mediated either directly through an increase in K+ conductance (Krnjevic,
1974; McCormick & Prince, 1986b) or indirectly as a consequence of cholinergic
excitation of neighbouring inhibitory interneurones (Benardo & Prince, 1982;
McCormick & Prince, 1986a).
In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of cholinergic inhibition and
excitation in the guinea-pig and cat medial and lateral geniculate nuclei and show
that they result from alterations in at least three distinct membrane ionic conductances.

GENICULATE ACTIONS OF ACh

METHODS

Techniques for preparation of thalamic slices for intracellular recordings were similar to those
published previously (Jahnsen & Llinas, 1984a). Male or female albino guinea-pigs (200-300 g), or
cats (2-12 months old) were deeply anaesthetized withl sodium pentobarbitone (i.P. 30 mg/kg for
guinea-pigs; i.v. 30 mg/kg for cats) and decapitated. A unilateral block of tissue which contained
both the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei of one side was removed and placed in physiological
saline at a temperature of 5 'C. All thalamic slices were prepared on a vibratome (Lancer Corporation) as 350-500 ,um coronal sections and placed in an interface-type recording chamber where
bath temperature was maintained at 36 +1 'C. Cat geniculate slices were maintained at 33-34 'C
to increase viability. The composition of the bathing medium was (in mM): NaCl, 126; KCl, 2-5;
NaH2PO4, 1-25; MgSO4, 2; CaCl2, 2; NaHCO3, 26; glucose, 10, unless otherwise noted. When
Mn2+ or Ba2+ was included in the bathing solution, phosphate and sulphate were omitted to prevent
precipitation. The bathing medium was saturated with 95% 02, 5 % CO2 and the pH was buffered
to 7-4. All slices were allowed to adapt within the recording chamber for at least 2 h before recording
commenced.
Intracellular recordings were obtained from neurones located in the dorsal division of the l.g.n.
(layer A or Al in the cat) and from the ventral division of the m.g.n. with bevelled microelectrodes
(125-175 MCI) filled with 4 M-potassium acetate. Bridge balance was continuously monitored and
adjusted. Only data from those neurones which had stable resting membrane potentials negative
to -55 mV and which generated overshooting action potentials were accepted for analysis. ACh
or other agonists (5-10 mm in micropipette) were applied by the pressure-pulse technique in which
a brief (10-20 ms; 207-345 kPa: 30-50 pounds per in2) pulse of nitrogen was applied to the rear of
a broken microelectrode (tip diameter of 2-5 ,um) containing the agonist dissolved in the bathing
medium. The volume of the resulting application was between 5 and 15 pl as estimated from the
diameter of the ejected droplet. Typically, the entry point of the drug-applying electrode was
within 50 pm of the recording electrode. The former was lowered in steps of 25-50 ,um to find the
region where application of the agonist elicited the largest response. For agents which are not
readily inactivated (e.g. DL-muscarine, 1 mM), application to the surface of the slice was found to
be sufficient to evoke large responses.
When the bathing medium was changed during the course of recording from a single neurone
(e.g. to one containing 0-5 mM-Ca2+, 4-8 mM-Mn2+ to block synaptic transmission), the agonistcontaining pipette was filled with the second solution.
Local synaptic events within the guinea-pig l.g.n.d. were evoked by stimuli delivered through a
concentric stimulation electrode placed either in the white matter just outside the l.g.n.d., or, more
typically, within the nucleus itself in close proximity to the intracellular recording electrode. Data
were recorded on magnetic tape (0-5000 Hz) and on a strip chart recorder for subsequent analysis.
All drugs were obtained from Sigma.
RESULTS

Actions of ACh in the guinea-pig l.g.n.d. and m.g.n.
Stable intracellular recordings were obtained from 179 lateral geniculate (l.g.n.d.)
and 18 medial geniculate (m.g.n.) neurones in the guinea-pig thalamic slice. A
representative sample of fifty of these neurones had an average input resistance (Ri)
of 51 + 19 MQl (mean + S.D.), resting membrane potential (Vm) of -65 + 7 mV and
action potential amplitude of 79 + 7 mV, in agreement with previous results (Jahnsen
& Llinas, 1984a).
Application of ACh to guinea-pig m.g.n. or l.g.n.d. neurones resulted in a hyperpolarization in all cells followed by a slow depolarization in 52 % of l.g.n.d. cells
and 46% of m.g.n. cells (Figs 1 and 2). In addition to these two responses, a small
number of l.g.n.d. neurones (see Table 1) also displayed a fast, initial depolarizing
response to ACh. The relative rarity of the rapidly depolarizing response and its

tendency to desensitize made it difficult to study adequately. However, this response
to ACh was quite robust in cat m.g.n. and l.g.n.d. neurones and is described in more
detail below.
In other regions of the nervous system, cholinergic inhibition and slow excitation
have been associated with the activation of muscarinic receptors (Krnjevic, 1974).
The ACh-induced hyperpolarization and slow depolarization of guinea-pig l.g.n.d.
and m.g.n. neurones also appear to be mediated through muscarinic receptors since
both responses were completely blocked by local application of the muscarinic
antagonist scopolamine (10 ,tM in micropipette; n = 3; Fig. 1 B) or could be activated

DL-muscarine (not shown).
The hyperpolarizing response of guinea-pig neurones to ACh or MCh had an onset
latency of 35-230 ms (n = 11). By manually adjusting the steady current injected
through the recordinig electrode it was possible to maintain a relatively constant
membrane potential (manual voltage clamp); under these conditions ACh or MCh
application resulted in a peak increase in apparent input conductance (Gi) of 4-13
nS (n = 12) (Fig. 2B). Similar methods indicated that the ACh- or MCh-induced slow
depolarization was associated with a decrease in Gi which peaked at 2-15 nS (n = 10)

(Fig. 2D).
Block of synaptic transmission
To test if the hyperpolarizing and slow depolarizing responses to ACh or MCh were
mediated by direct activation of muscarinic receptors, synaptic transmission was

152

eliminated either by local application of the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX;
10 /uM; n = 4) or by reducing [Ca2+]0 to 0 5 mm and adding 4-8 mM-Mn2+ (n = 10) to
the bathing medium. Both manipulations completely blocked stimulus-evoked synaptic transmission but failed to block the ACh- or MCh-induced hyperpolarization
(n = 14) or slow depolarization (n = 7) (Fig. 3). Such results indicate that these two
actions of ACh or MCh are direct and are not dependent on either release of other
neurotransmitters or entry of Ca2+ into the neurones from the extracellular space.

hyperpolarization to [K+]0. The dashed line represents the slope (60 mV/tenfold change)

mean + S.E.

Ionic mechanisma of muscarinic hyperpolarization
In order to determine the reversal potential of the muscarinic hyperpolarization,
we applied ACh or MCh to neurones depolarized or hyperpolarized to various Vm
values with the intracellular injection of d.c. (e.g. Figs 4 and 6). The muscarinic
hyperpolarization was largest at depolarized, and smallest at hyperpolarized, Vm
values (Fig. 4A). In perfusion solutions containing 2-5 or 5 0 mM-K+, it was difficult
to reverse this response due in part to substantial decreases in Ri during currentinduced hyperpolarizations. In these cases, the reversal potential of the responses
was estimated by extrapolation (e.g. see Fig. 6). Addition of low concentrations of
Cs+ (2-3 mM) to the bathing medium suppressed this voltage-dependent decrease in
Ri (Halliwell & Adams, 1982) without substantially affecting the muscarinic hyperpolarization. Under these conditions the muscarinic hyperpolarization could be
readily reversed (Fig. 4A). The extrapolated reversal potential of the ACh- or MChinduced hyperpolarization in normal solutions was - 89-2 + 11-6 mV (n = 13) in 5
mM-extracellular K+, which agrees with the directly determined reversal potential in
solutions containing 2 mM-Cs+ and 5 mM-K+ (- 84-5 + 4-2 mV; n = 3) (Fig. 4A).

Muscarinic hyperpolarizations in cells obtained in 2-5 mM-K' had extrapolated reversal potentials of -101 4 + 8-5 mV (n = 11; see Fig. 6) while those of cells obtained
in 7'5 mM-K+ reversed at - 72'8 + 5-7 mV (n = 4). These reversal potentials yield an
estimated change in the equilibrium potential of ACh-induced hyperpolarization
(EACh) of 62 mV per tenfold change in [K+]0 (Fig. 4B), which is very close to that
predicted by the Nernst equation (60 mV per tenfold change in [K+].). Changes in
[K+]O from 2'5 to 7'5 mm resulted in a positive shift of the reversal potential of the
hyperpolarizing response of 32-5 + 7-8 mV in single neurones (n = 5), confirming the
above results. In one cell which was held during a change back to 2'5 mM-[K+]0, the
original reversal potential was again attained.

Effects of extracellular Ba2+ and intracellular Cs+
To examine further the hypothesis that the ACh- or MCh-induced hyperpolarization is due to an increase in membrane potassium conductance (gK+), we tested the

154

D. A. McCORMICK AND D. A. PRINCE

effects of extracellular Ba2+ and intracellular Cs+ on this response, since both of these
ions have been shown to reduce gK+ values (Krnjevic', Pumain & Renaud, 1971;
Constanti, Adams & Brown, 1981; Puil & Werman, 1981).
Perfusion of the slices with solutions containg Ba2+ (300-500 ,tM) greatly reduced
(n = 3) or blocked (n = 4) the muscarinic hyperpolarization (Fig. 5A) and increased
the apparent input resistance (Ri). These changes were fully reversible upon reperfusion with normal solution (Fig. 5A, wash). Similarly, intracellular iontophoresis
of caesium acetate (0 15-0-5 nA for 15-30 s) greatly increased the duration of the
action potential (Fig. 5C, middle trace), increased Ri, and reduced the ACh-induced
hyperpolarization by an average of 68 + 18 % (n = 12) (Fig. 5B, intracellular caesium
acetate). During the 1-3 min following intracellular Cs+ iontophoresis, the spike
duration and Ri slowly returned to near their initial values. Application of ACh after
apparent recovery from the effect of internal Cs+ again caused the typical hyperpolarizing response (Fig. 5B, recovery). To test whether these effects were due to the
intracellular injection of Cs+ or to an effect of depolarization alone, we repeated the
experiment in an additional ten cells using 4 M-potassium-acetate-filled microelectrodes. Intracellular injection of current (0 5-0-8 nA, 20-30 s) had either no effect
(Fig. 5D) or caused only a slight reduction (average of 16+ 18 %) of the ACh-induced
hyperpolarization. The difference in reduction of the ACh-induced hyperpolarization
in caesium-acetate-filled neurones and those filled with potassium acetate is statistically significant (t = 6-4, d.f. = 20, P < 0-001). These results confirm the hypothesis that the ACh-induced hyperpolarization is due to an increase in K+ conductance.
Ionic mechanisms of the cholinergic slow depolarization
The ACh or MCh-induced slow depolarization was largest at depolarized Vm values
and had an extrapolated reversal potential of -100-4 + 11-9 mV (n = 5) in 2-5 mm[K+]O, a value close to that for the muscarinic hyperpolarization in the same cells
(-93-7 + 8-5 mV) (Fig. 6). Given the close correspondence of these reversal potentials
and the fact that the muscarinic hyperpolarization results from an increase in gK+
implies that the muscarinic slow depolarization may result from a decrease in gK+.
Indeed, changing the concentration of extracellular K+ in the bathing medium from
1-0 to 7-5 mm while testing the response to MCh at membrane potentials around
-60 mV decreased the amplitude of the MCh-induced hyperpolarization by an
average of 57-1 +9 % (n = 8) and the slow depolarization by 47-7 + 16-5 % (n = 6)
(Fig. 7). Changing extracellular [K+] from 7-5 to 1 0 mm had the opposite effect: the
hyperpolarization response was increased in amplitude (89 + 34-2 %; n = 7) as was
the slow depolarizing response (68 + 20-4 %; n = 5) (Fig. 7).

Effects of ACh in cat l.g.n.d. and m.g.n.
Extracellular studies of the actions of ACh in the cat l.g.n.d. in vivo uniformly
indicate that ACh has an almost exclusively excitatory action on relay neurones
(Phillis, 1971; Krnjevic, 1974; Sillito et al. 1983; Eysel et al. 1986). In the cat m.g.n.,
however, ACh can cause both inhibition and excitation (Tebecis, 1972). Furthermore,
some of these excitatory responses in both nuclei are reportedly particularly rapid in
onset and offset, and are associated with increases in spike firing frequencies often

exceeding those found with similar applications of glutamate (e.g. Sillito et al. 1983).
Our results in the guinea-pig would therefore appear to be at least in part contradictory to these findings. One possible explanation for this discrepancy would be
species differences. We therefore investigated the actions of ACh in the cat medial
and lateral geniculate nuclei.

Cholinergic agonists were applied to neurones obtained from cat l.g.n.d. (layers A
or Al; n = 43) or m.g.n. (n = 14) slices. These cells had stable resting Vm values of
-66+7 mV, action potential amplitudes of 81+7 mV, and an average Ri of
43 + 24 MQ. Nearly all cat l.g.n.d. and m.g.n. neurones exhibited a robust lowthreshold Ca2` spike, as reported in vivo (Steriade & Deschenes, 1984).
Applications of ACh to cat l.g.n.d. and m.g.n. neurones resulted in three separate
responses: a rapid depolarization, followed in some cells by a hyperpolarization,
followed in some cells by a slow depolarization (Fig. 8). The percentages of occurrence
of each response in the l.g.n.d. and m.g.n. for both the cat and guinea-pig are
presented in Table 1. Antidromic activation of l.g.n.d. neurones by stimulation of

fibres in the optic radiation (n = 4) or intracellular injection of the fluorescent dye
Lucifer Yellow CH (n = 5) showed that these responses were generated by thalamocortical relay neurones. We did not obtain recordings from a large enough sample
of morphologically identified neurones to correlate type of ACh response with the
different classes of lateral geniculate neurones.
The rapid depolarization to ACh occurred in nearly all cells in the cat l.g.n.d.
(n = 30/32) and m.g.n. (n = 6/6) with an onset latency that could be as short as the
delay imposed by the ACh application system (i.e. approximately 10 ms). The hyperpolarization to ACh or MCh was prevalent in m.g.n. neurones (n = 14/14; Fig. 8E),
but could also occur in some l.g.n.d. neurones (n = 14/43; Fig. 8D) although even
then only weakly. The slow depolarization occurred with about equal frequency in
both nuclei (Table 1). By using manual voltage-clamp techniques, or by setting the
membrane potential to the peak voltage deviation generated during the response, it
was possible to show that the ACh-induced rapid depolarization and hyperpolarization were associated with increases in Gi (not shown), while the slow depolarization
was assocated with a decrease in Gi (Fig. 8B and D).
Previous extracellular studies have indicated that the actions of ACh in the cat
geniculate nuclei are mediated by both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors (Phillis,
1971; Krnjevic, 1974). To test this possibility, we applied the muscarinic agonist
MCh or the nicotinic agonists DMPP (1,1-dimethylpiperazinium) or nicotine to both
m.g.n. and l.g.n.d. neurones. Application of MCh resulted in either the hyperpolarizing response and associated increase in Gi, the slow depolarizing response and a
decrease in Gi, or both (Fig. 8D). These results indicate that the hyperpolariz;ng and
slow depolarizing actions of ACh are mediated at least in part by the activation of
muscarinic receptors.
Applications of the nicotinic agonists, nicotine or DMPP, resulted in a slow depolarization associated with a substantial increase in Gi (Fig. 8 F). Furthermore, after
the application of nicotine, the fast excitatory response to ACh, but not the hyperpolarizing or slow depolarizing responses, was substantially decreased (not shown).

The slow time course of the depolarizations induced by nicotine and DMPP contrasts
with the rapidity of the ACh-induced fast depolarizations and is a well-known
characteristic of these nicotinic agonists (Brown, Halliwell & Scholfield, 1971).
These results indicate that the application of ACh to cat geniculate neurones can
activate both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. Activation of the nicotinic receptors
causes a rapid depolarization, similar to that found in some other parts of the central
and peripheral nervous system (Takeuchi & Takeuchi, 1960; Dennis, Harris, &
Kuffler, 1971; Krnjevic, 1974; McCormick & Prince, 1987), and activation of muscarinic receptors causes both hyperpolarizing and slow depolarizing responses, as in
guinea-pig geniculate nuclei.

Extrapolated reversal potentials of cat l.g.n.d. and m.g.n. cholinergic responses
The ACh-induced rapid depolarization was largest at hyperpolarized Vm values,
smallest at depolarized Vm values, and had an extrapolated reversal potential of
between -36 and -49 mV. However, these extrapolated reversal potentials are
probably substantially more negative than the real reversal potential due to severe
non-linearities in Ri over the range of Vm values tested. To try and circumvent this
problem, the equilibrium potential was also estimated by the manual voltage clamp
technique during applications of DMPP and the equation: reversal potential =
clamp potential + clamp current/AGi (Fig. 8F; Ginsborg, 1967). Using this approach,
the estimated reversal potential of this depolarizing response ranged from -4 to
-30 mV and averaged -18-9+8-9 mV (n = 6).
Applications of MCh to m.g.n. neurones held at different membrane potentials
indicated that the hyperpolarizing response had an average extrapolated reversal
potential of -97 + 6-1 mV (n = 4; [K+]o = 2-5 mM), similar to that of the muscarinic
hyperpolarization in the guinea-pig. The reversal potential of the slow depolarization
in the cat was not ascertained.

Effects of cholinergic responses on neuronal firing pattern
Thalamic cells have two basic modes of action potential generation: single-spike
firing, which occurs at membrane potentials depolarized to approximately -55 mV,
and burst firing which occurs at membrane potentials negative to approximately
-65 mV (Jahnsen & Llinas, 1984a, b; Deschenes & Steriade, 1986). When Vm is
between -55 and -65 mV, the cells are subthreshold; excitatory inputs will not
generate action potentials unless they depolarize Vm out of this range. The burst
firing characteristic of thalamic neurones is due to the presence of a low-threshold
Ca2+ current, which is also known as the t-current (Jahnsen & Llinas, 1984a, b;
Nowycky, Fox & Tsien, 1985; Deschenes & Steriade, 1986). This Ca2+ current is
totally inactivated at membrane potentials positive to approximately -65 mV, and
therefore is only active at relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials. The possibility that the ACh-induced effects on potassium conductance may interact with
the different firing modes of thalamic neurones was tested by applying MCh or ACh
during either the injection of depolarizing current pulses or activation of excitatory
synaptic inputs.
When geniculate neurones were depolarized to near firing threshold (e.g. -50 to
-61 mV), depolarizing current pulses gave rise to single action potentials with no

Fig. 9. Effects of muscarinic hyperpolarization and slow depolarization on the response
of a guinea-pig l.g.n.d. neurone to a depolarizing current pulse. Responses to three
applications of MCh are illustrated when the membrane potential was held with d.c. at
levels indicated to left of each segment. The cell was in the single-spike firing mode (A),
the burst firing mode (C), and in between (B). Sample traces are expanded for detail as
indicated. The effect of mimicking the MCh-induced change in Vm with the intracellular
injection of current is indicated by d.c. This particular neurone was in the burst firing
mode when the membrane potential was around -80 mV. A more typical membrane
potential for this type of activity would be between -70 and -75 mV. See text for details.

burst discharges (Fig. 9A a). Under these circumstances, the ACh-induced increase in
potassium conductance inhibits the single spike firing and partially de-inactivates
the low-threshold Ca2+ current which subsequently generates a small depolarization
(Fig. 9A b). The muscarinic slow depolarization, on the other hand, dramatically
increases the number of action potentials generated by the current pulse (Fig. 9A d).
Hyperpolarizing or depolarizing the membrane potential to a similar extent with the
intracellular injection of d.c. yielded similar results (Fig. 9A c and e - d.c. controls),
indicating that these effects are due in large part to the MCh-induced alterations
in Vm.
When the membrane potential of the cell was such that the depolarizing current

160

pulse caused neither single action potentials nor bursts (-75 mV; Fig. 9 Ba), application of ACh initially hyperpolarized the membrane potential and increased the
amplitude of the low-threshold Ca21 current so that it became suprathreshold and
generated a burst discharge (Fig. 9Bb). This hyperpolarization was followed by a
slow depolarization which either completely (Fig. 9Bd), or partially (Fig. 9Cd),
decreased the low-threshold Ca21 current. Again, these effects of MCh were similar to
those brought about by changes in Vm induced by intracellular injection of d.c.
(Fig. 9Bc and e - traces labelled d.c.).
Application of MCh to neurones hyperpolarized well into the range of the burst
firing mode (Fig. 9Ca), resulted in a hyperpolarization and increase in membrane
conductance which either caused a delay to the onset, or complete inhibition, of the
burst discharge (Fig. 9 C b). These effects appear to be due to the increase in Gi during
the hyperpolarizing response, since similar hyperpolarizations with intracellular injection of d.c. did not inhibit the burst discharge (Fig. 9Cc). The slow depolarizing
response again was very effective at inhibiting burst activity (Fig. 9Cd). These results
indicate that many of the effects of cholinergic agents on the neuronal firing pattern
of geniculate neurones can be explained by the resulting alterations in Vm, although
additional effects can also occur through changes in Gi.
DISCUSSION

The results of this study indicate that in the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei,
ACh can cause at least three different responses: fast nicotinic excitation, slow
muscarinic excitation, and muscarinic inhibition. Furthermore, these three responses
occur with varying frequencies not only between these two geniculate nuclei, but also
between various species of animals (e.g. Table 1). Indeed, we have recently found
that application of ACh to l.g.n.d. neurones of albino rats results in the slow depolarization only; fast depolarizations or hyperpolarizations are only rarely seen
(McCormick & Prince, 1986c).
The cholinergic slow depolarizing response appears to be the only common response
between all nuclei in all three species tested. The nicotinic excitatory response is
especially prevalent in cat, but not guinea-pig or rat, l.g.n.d. and m.g.n. The AChinduced hyperpolarization, on the other hand, is prevalent in guinea-pig, but not cat
or rat, l.g.n.d. Preliminary results indicate that these differences are not due to the
use of albino guinea-pigs and rats, since application of ACh to l.g.n.d. neurones
obtained from non-albino guinea-pigs resulted in responses identical to those reported
here for albino guinea-pigs (D. A. McCormick & D. A. Prince, unpublished observations). The reason for these species differences is unknown. Although we have
studied presumptive geniculocortical relay cells in all species, it may not be entirely
appropriate to compare the relay cells of lamina A and Al of the cat with those of
the l.g.n.d. of the guinea-pig or rat. Further work is required before these species
differences are fully understood.
Previous extracellular in vivo recordings in the cat l.g.n.d. and m.g.n. revealed that
geniculate neurones respond to iontophoretic applications of ACh with three different
types of response: (1) excitation which was rapid in both onset and offset; (2) slow
excitation which was delayed in both onset and offset; and (3) inhibition. Pharma-

GENICULATE ACTIONS OF ACh

cological studies indicated that these three responses were mediated by both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors (Phillis, 1971; Krnjevic', 1974). Our results suggest
that nicotinic receptors are responsible for the rapid excitatory actions of ACh, while
the inhibitory and slow excitatory actions are mediated by muscarinic receptors.

Mechanisms of ACh actions in the m.g.n. and l.g.n.d.
ACh-induced rapid depolarization. The fast depolarizing action of ACh in cat
geniculate neurones appears to be mediated by an increase in membrane conductance
due to activation of nicotinic receptors. The projected reversal potential of this fast
depolarization is similar to that found in the peripheral nervous system (Dennis et al.
1971) and skeletal muscle (Takeuchi & Takeuchi, 1960) where ACh is known to cause
an increase in membrane cation conductance. This result therefore suggests that the
rapid excitatory action of ACh in the cat geniculate nuclei is also due to activation
of a cation conductance, although this feature of cholinergic responses awaits further
study. In the guinea-pig we have recently shown that neurones in the epithalamic
nucleus, the medial habenula, respond to ACh with a fast, nicotinic depolarization,
very similar to that reported here (McCormick & Prince, 1987).
ACh-induced hyperpolarization. Our data indicate that the muscarinic hyperpolarization of guinea-pig m.g.n. and l.g.n.d. neurones is due to the activation of a
potassium conductance, similar to that which we have reported in the guinea-pig
nucleus reticularis of the thalamus (McCormick & Prince, 1986b) and that which
occurs in the rat nucleus parabrachialis of the brain stem (North, 1986), and also
which occurs in many parts of the vertebrate peripheral nervous system (reviewed by
North, 1986). The similarity in the extrapolated reversal potentials of the MChinduced hyperpolarization of the cat m.g.n. neurones and guinea-pig geniculate
neurones suggests an identity of mechanisms between the two species.
The hyperpolarizing action of ACh is not only proficient at inhibiting ongoing
single-spike activity, but also has the ability to remove inactivation of the lowthreshold Ca2+ current and thereby increase the probability of the occurrence of
burst discharges (e.g. see Fig. 9, -61 and -75 mV).
ACh-induced slow depolarization. In other parts of the central and peripheral
nervous system, ACh-induced slow depolarizations result from the suppression of up
to three different types of potassium conductances and associated currents: a voltagedependent K+ conductance (Adams & Brown, 1982; Benardo & Prince, 1982;
Halliwell & Adams, 1982; Halliwell, 1986); a voltage-independent potassium conductance (Benardo & Prince, 1982; Morita, North & Tokimasa, 1982; Madison et al.
1987); and a calcium-activated K+ conductance (Benardo & Prince, 1982;
McCormick & Prince, 1986a; Madison et al. 1987; see North, 1986). Given the
persistence of the ACh-induced slow depolarization of geniculate neurones in the
presence of Mn2+, low Ca2+, and the ability of MCh to generate responses even at
negative membrane potentials (e.g. -95 mV, Fig. 6), the most parsimonious explanation is that this response is due to, at least in part, the suppression of a voltageindependent resting K+ current. However, it is possible that ACh-induced slow
depolarizations of geniculate neurones result entirely from the suppression of a
voltage-dependent K+ current (i.e. M-current) which is located remotely in the
dendritic tree where Vm is not easily changed with a microelectrode located in the
6

soma. Our data do not rule out the possible contribution of Ca2+-activated or voltagedependent currents (e.g. after-hyperpolarization currents or M-current) and further
investigations are required to determine the presence and possible modulation of
these currents by ACh in geniculate neurones. The slow depolarizing response inhibited the occurrence of burst discharges and promoted the occurrence of singlespike firing, an action exactly opposite to the hyperpolarizing response.

Possible involvement of ACh in the ascending control of arousal
Electrophysiological recording (Steriade, Oakson & Ropert, 1982), stimulation
(Moruzzi & Magoun, 1949; Symmes & Anderson, 1967; Satinsky, 1968; Doty, Wilson,
Bartlett, & Pecci-Saavedra, 1973; Foote et al. 1974; Kitsikis & Steriade, 1981;
Ahlsen, Lindstr6m, & Lo, 1984; Francesconi et al. 1984) and lesion (Watson, Heilman,
Miller & King, 1974) experiments (also see reviews by Steriade, 1970; Singer, 1977;
Burke & Cole, 1978) have indicated the presence of an ascending brain-stem system
which has the ability to control the level of neuronal excitability in both the thalamus
and cerebral cortex. The possibility that the brain-stem influences may be mediated,
at least in part, by the activation of ACh-releasing neurones has been suggested by a
number of investigators (Singer, 1977; Steriade & Deschenes, 1984; Sherman &
Koch, 1986). lontophoretic application of ACh to lateral geniculate neurones results
in a facilitation of the transfer of visual information similar to that produced by
brain-stem stimulation. In some cases it has been possible to block both the facilitating effects of ACh iontophoresis and brain-stem stimulation with the local iontophoretic application or systemic administration of the muscarinic antagonists
atropine or scopolamine (Francesconi et al. 1984; Deschenes et al. 1986; Kayama
et al. 1986).
Our results indicate some of the mechanisms by which ACh can modulate the
transfer of sensory information through the geniculate nuclei. The ACh-induced slow
depolarization of relay neurones is especially proficient in moving the membrane
potential out of the burst firing range towards the range of single-spike firing (e.g.
Fig. 9). Such a shift in membrane potential and firing mode occurs upon arousal from
synchronized sleep (Livingstone & Hubel, 1981; Hirsch, Fourment & Marc, 1983;
McCarley, Benoit & Barrionuevo, 1983), and also is known to greatly enhance the
transfer of visual information through the cat l.g.n. (Coenen & Vendrik, 1972;
Bartlett, Doty, Pecci-Saavedra & Wilson, 1973; Livingstone & Hubel, 1981). However, given that ACh can cause not only slow excitation, but also fast excitation and
inhibition in the geniculate nuclei, its role in the regulation of thalamic activity may
be more complicated than previously thought.

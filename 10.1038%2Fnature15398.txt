was higher in cross-modal trials (n 5 4 mice, P , 0.05, bootstrap comparison; see Extended Data Fig. 2 for single-mouse examples and fixed
lapse rate analysis). This difference persisted even when the conflicting
auditory stimulus was randomly but systematically removed (Fig. 1e
and Extended Data Fig. 3), suggesting that diminished visual perception
under cross-modal conditions is a result of expectation (top-down)

How the brain selects appropriate sensory inputs and suppresses
distractors is unknown. Given the well-established role of the
prefrontal cortex (PFC) in executive function1, its interactions with
sensory cortical areas during attention have been hypothesized to
control sensory selection2–5. To test this idea and, more generally,
dissect the circuits underlying sensory selection, we developed a
cross-modal divided-attention task in mice that allowed genetic
access to this cognitive process. By optogenetically perturbing
PFC function in a temporally precise window, the ability of mice
to select appropriately between conflicting visual and auditory
stimuli was diminished. Equivalent sensory thalamocortical
manipulations showed that behaviour was causally dependent on
PFC interactions with the sensory thalamus, not sensory cortex.
Consistent with this notion, we found neurons of the visual thalamic reticular nucleus (visTRN) to exhibit PFC-dependent changes
in firing rate predictive of the modality selected. visTRN activity
was causal to performance as confirmed by bidirectional optogenetic manipulations of this subnetwork. Using a combination
of electrophysiology and intracellular chloride photometry, we
demonstrated that visTRN dynamically controls visual thalamic
gain through feedforward inhibition. Our experiments introduce
a new subcortical model of sensory selection, in which the PFC
biases thalamic reticular subnetworks to control thalamic sensory
gain, selecting appropriate inputs for further processing.
To dissect the circuit basis of sensory selection, we sought a
behaviour capable of dividing attention across modalities in the freely
behaving mouse. Building on the rich history of visual neuroscience6–8,
we focused our investigations on visual processing under conditions in
which vision was behaviourally selected or suppressed (Fig. 1a). As
such, we developed and validated a two-alternative forced-choice task
in which mice selected between conflicting visual and auditory stimuli
on a trial-by-trial basis. Stimuli indicated the location where a mouse
had to nose poke to obtain a reward. Trial availability and target
modality were signalled through binaurally emitted noise. For some
mice, brown noise (10-kHz low-pass-filtered white noise) signalled a
visual target (Fig. 1b, top) whereas blue noise (11-kHz high-passfiltered white noise) signalled an auditory target (Fig. 1b, bottom).
Cueing was counterbalanced across mice, with no effect on performance noted. By design, the task was asymmetric, with a visual detection
component (flash from a light-emitting diode (LED) appearing to the
right or left) and an auditory discrimination component (upsweep,
10–14 kHz; downsweep, 16–12 kHz). Multiple quality control metrics
ensured that mice performed this task using the biasing cues (brown
and blue noise) rather than low-level alternating strategies (Extended
Data Fig. 1). Performance on the two modalities was balanced (n 5 15
mice, Fig. 1c).
Comparing visual detection under cross-modal and visual-only conditions suggested divided attention between vision and audition in the
cross-modal task (Fig. 1d). Specifically, the visual detection threshold

nucleus; V1, primary visual cortex). b, Task design. A mouse is simultaneously
informed about trial availability and the nature of the target stimulus

‘attend to vision’ and blue noise denotes ‘attend to audition’. Following a
variable anticipation, during which the mouse is required to hold its snout in a
centrally located poke, conflicting auditory and visual stimuli are presented.
By design, the task is asymmetric, having a visual detection component
(presence or absence of light at the reward location) and an auditory
discrimination component (upsweep, turn left; downsweep, turn right).

(mean 6 s.e.m., n 5 15 mice). d, Visual detection performance in cross-modal

(n 5 4 mice, $211 trials per condition). f, When mice were not differentially

rather than sensory interference (bottom-up). Conversely, when mice
selected targets based on reward history, detection threshold was unaffected (Fig. 1f, n 5 6 mice). Selective suppression of the visual detection threshold in cross-modal trials was observed in both the raw
(Fig. 1d, e) and the fitted (Fig. 1g) data. Together, these findings suggest
that a cued, trial-by-trial task design is required for investigating sensory
selection in divided attention.
Given the known role of PFC in top-down control of sensory processing and that our psychophysical measurements revealed top-down
engagement in the cross-modal task, we asked whether cross-modal
performance was PFC dependent. We targeted the prelimbic cortex
because of its known homology to primate dorsolateral PFC9. We used
the VGAT-ChR2 mouse to perturb PFC function in a temporally
precise manner. In this mouse, the light-activated ion channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is expressed under the vesicular GABA (caminobutyric acid) transporter promoter (VGAT)10. Optogenetic
drive in this mouse is known to exert intensity- and durationdependent inhibition of excitatory neural activity11,12. Using this
approach, we observed behavioural disruption only when the PFC
activity was perturbed during stimulus anticipation (Fig. 2a, n 5 4

Top-down thalamic modulation
and subsequent cortical amplification

Figure 2 | Evidence for top-down thalamic modulation in divided attention.
a, Disrupting PFC activity by delivering blue laser pulses (50 Hz, 18 ms, 90%
duty cycle) impaired task performance at 100% stimulus intensity equally
on both modalities only when manipulation was performed during stimulus
anticipation (n 5 4 mice, *P , 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). b, The effect
was related to the cross-modal nature of the task, not its difficulty, as PFC
inhibition did not affect performance on a visual-only task. c, Disruption of
primary visual cortex during stimulus presentation impaired performance on
visual trials (n 5 4 mice). d, The effect in c was related to task difficulty, as
the visual detection threshold increased in a visual-only task. e, The data in
a and c do not support a causal role for PFC interactions with primary visual
cortex in performance. f, Perturbing visual thalamic function in a manner
similar to cortical perturbations in VGAT-ChR2 mice preferentially
diminished performance on visual trials during both anticipation and presentation of target stimuli (n 5 12 sessions from 3 mice, *P , 0.05, **P , 0.01,
***P , 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). g, The finding in f supports a
model in which PFC activity influences thalamic sensory processing. Bar

mice). This effect was dependent on the cross-modal nature of the
task, as perturbing PFC activity in a visual-only task had no effect
on performance regardless of task difficulty (Fig. 2b, n 5 3 mice,
$246 trials per condition).
We reasoned that the PFC might be exerting its effect on performance by biasing sensory circuits towards target stimulus processing and
distractor suppression. Several studies have suggested that this topdown bias is exerted at the level of the sensory cortex4,13. We did not
find this to be the case in our task; perturbing visual cortical activity
diminished visual performance only during stimulus presentation
(Fig. 2c). This effect, unlike that of the PFC, was not cross-modal task
specific, as it increased the detection threshold in a visual-only task
(Fig. 2d, n 5 3 mice, $239 trials per condition, P , 0.01, bootstrap
comparison). An analogous manipulation of auditory cortex resulted
in a qualitatively similar effect on performance, but with a larger effect
size (Extended Data Fig. 4a, n 5 4 mice, **P , 0.01, Wilcoxon ranksum test), probably owing to the auditory cortical requirement for
stimulus discrimination14. Together, these findings support the role
of sensory cortical areas in stimulus amplification and discrimination,
but are inconsistent with their being a locus for top-down bias of
sensory processing. Moreover, optogenetic perturbations of frontal
regions that project directly to visual and auditory cortices such as
the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC) did not affect cross-modal performance (Extended Data Fig. 4b,
c, n 5 8 sessions, 2 mice). In contrast, localized viral injection of AAVhSyn-DIO-ChR2 into the prelimbic cortex of mice in which Cre
recombinase is expressed in inhibitory neurons (VGAT-Cre), followed
by optical manipulation, disrupted performance (Extended Data
Fig. 4d–h).
Having shown that direct prefrontal–sensory cortical interaction is
unlikely to account for top-down control of visual processing
(Fig. 2e), we sought to find the locus of attentional modulation
observed in the cross-modal task (Fig. 1c). The sensory thalamus
has been implicated in attentional modulation in primates15–17, raising
the possibility that it could be a locus of top-down sensory bias. Using
a similar VGAT-ChR2 strategy, we found that optogenetic perturbation of the visual thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus; LGN) during
either stimulus anticipation or presentation impaired cross-modal
performance (Fig. 2f, n 5 12 sessions, 3 mice). This suggested that
top-down bias of visual detection may be based in the thalamus
(Fig. 2g). Visual thalamic manipulation resulted in worsening performance on both auditory and visual trials, implicating intrathalamic
interactions in this behavioural effect. Intrathalamic interactions are
mediated by a shell of GABAergic neurons surrounding thalamic
nuclei known as the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN)18. TRN neurons have been hypothesized to control the gain of thalamic output
in a behaviourally relevant manner19,20. As such, we asked whether
the TRN could be a locus of top-down modulation of the sensory
thalamus.
To investigate the role of the TRN in visual gain control in divided
attention, we used an intersectional genetic/connectivity strategy to
label inhibitory (VGAT-positive) neurons that project to the LGN with
retrograde lentiviruses20 (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5a, b) and
optogenetically tagged them during extracellular recordings in freely
behaving mice (Extended Data Fig. 5c–f).
During cross-modal performance, we observed bidirectional modulation of visTRN neurons consistent with their hypothesized role in
behaviourally relevant sensory gain control. Specifically, during
‘attend to vision’ trials, firing rates of these neurons were reduced. In
contrast, their rates were elevated during ‘attend to audition’ trials
(Fig. 3b (example), Fig. 3c (population; n 5 138 cells) and Extended
Data Fig. 6). Attentional modulation by the visTRN was eliminated by
optogenetic PFC disruption (Fig. 3d, e, n 5 56 cells). Although PFC
disruption diminished performance, the effects on visTRN firing rates
were not simply a covariant of inaccurate performance (Extended Data
Fig. 7). In contrast to naturally occurring error trials, during which

responses from visTRN neurons (n 5 138 cells from 4 animals, P , 0.005,
Wilcoxon rank-sum test performed over all cells). The orange crosshair
indicates mean 6 95% confidence interval. d, PFC activity was disrupted
during stimulus anticipation to examine the effect on visTRN activity. e, PFC
disruption diminished visTRN modulation of attention. f, g, Behavioural

f, Optogenetic activation of retrograde-tagged visTRN neurons resulted in
performance diminishing on visual trials (mean 6 s.e.m., n 5 12 sessions from
3 mice, *P , 0.05, **P , 0.01, ***P , 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test),
consistent with this manipulation lowering visual gain. g, In contrast,
optogenetic inhibition of visTRN neurons preferentially diminished
performance on auditory trials, consistent with inappropriate visual gain
increase (n 5 12 sessions from 3 mice).

diminished visTRN firing rate modulation was observed in both
‘attend to vision’ and ‘attend to audition’ trials, PFC disruption had
a greater effect on ‘attend to audition’ trials. This result may highlight a
role of the PFC in distractor suppression.
To examine whether the physiological effects observed in the
visTRN were causal to behaviour, we manipulated this subnetwork
bidirectionally. Although activating the visTRN resulted in similar
effects to driving LGN inhibition in VGAT-ChR2 mice (Fig. 3f,
n 5 12 sessions, 3 mice), the effect size was smaller, probably reflecting
the weaker nature of the genetic manipulation (Extended Data Fig. 8).
This result supports the notion that elevated visTRN firing reduces
visual thalamic gain. In contrast, inhibiting visTRN function using the
light-activated Cl– pump eNpHR3.0 diminished performance on
‘attend to audition’ trials, suggesting it inappropriately enhanced
visual thalamic gain when it needed to be suppressed (Fig. 3g,
n 5 12 sessions, 3 mice).

dashed line indicates baseline potential). Shaded errors are 95% confidence
intervals. Orange blocks denote visual stimulus presentation.

To determine whether modulation of visTRN firing rate affected
visual processing, we investigated LGN spiking in response to
well-controlled visual stimuli. We implanted mice with multielectrode arrays targeted to the LGN (Fig. 4a). To minimize trial-totrial variability related to slight changes in head and eye position, we
changed the position of visual stimuli from wall-mounted to headmounted LEDs. LGN neurons showed enhanced baseline and evoked
activity when attention was directed to vision (Fig. 4b (example),
Fig. 4c, d, (population, n 5 161 cells, 4 mice)), consistent with baseline
and evoked neuroimaging results observed in human LGN21.
Differences in evoked responses were also observed in the visual
evoked potential (Fig. 4e, n 5 684 visual trials and n 5 633 auditory
trials, 4 mice). These physiological effects were not observed during
error trials (Extended Data Fig. 9).
Suppression of LGN spiking in ‘attend to audition’ trials could be a
result of direct feedforward inhibition or reduction in feedforward
excitation. In contrast to many extrareticular inhibitory inputs22, the
visTRN is known to exert direct feedforward inhibition on LGN neurons23 (Fig. 5a). As such, we sought to measure LGN inhibition
directly. To do so, we leveraged a recently developed technique known
as fibre photometry, which has been used to measure bulk changes of
intracellular Ca21 concentration ([Ca21]i) (ref. 24). We modified two
aspects of conventional photometry to allow interrogation of intracellular Cl– concentration ([Cl–]i), a proxy for synaptic inhibition and
an otherwise inaccessible measure. First was the genetic labelling of
neurons with the Cl– indicator SuperClomeleon25. This fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) indicator contains cyan fluorescent

protein (CFP) as FRET donor and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) as
FRET acceptor. Under conditions of elevated [Cl–]i, YFP is quenched
and FRET is reduced (Fig. 5b). Second was the light path; we excited
SuperClomeleon with 430-nm light and collected both CFP and YFP
emission data to perform subsequent ratiometric measurements offline (Fig. 5b). To use this technology in vivo, we generated a viral

construct
harbouring
SuperClomeleon
(AAV-hSynSuperClomeleon) and injected it into the LGN (Fig. 5c).
We validated SuperClomeleon FRET as a measure of inhibition
by two methods. First, we reasoned that pharmacological activation
of GABAA receptors would increase [Cl–]i and reduce YFP emission.
Indeed, intraperitoneal injection of the GABAA agonist 4,5,6,7tetrahydroisoxazolo(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol (THIP, 8 mg kg–1) reduced
SuperClomeleon FRET in a pharmacokinetically predicted manner26
(Fig. 5d, n 5 3 mice). Second, we expected visual drive to result in
inhibition of LGN neurons that balanced excitation. This was
indeed the case; these signals were larger when visual stimuli were
delivered to the side contralateral to the recorded LGN than when
delivered to the ipsilateral side (Fig. 5e, n 5 3 mice). These rapid
events were not observed in YFP control mice (Extended Data
Fig. 10a). SuperClomeleon visual transients were sensitive to the
GABAA receptor antagonist flumazenil in a dose-dependent manner
(Extended Data Fig. 10b), confirming that these signals reflect
GABAergic inhibition.
Having validated chloride photometry, we asked whether changes
in visual gain associated with sensory selection were explained by
opposing changes in LGN feedforward inhibition. We found this to
be the case; visual-evoked chloride photometry showed significantly
larger responses in ‘attend to audition’ trials than in ‘attend to vision’
trials (Fig. 5f, n 5 363 visual trials and n 5 274 auditory trials, 6 mice;
example trials shown in Supplementary Video 1). Signal kinetics in
these two conditions were distinct: an earlier reduction in FRET ratio
was seen in auditory selection trials compared to visual selection trials,
consistent with the differential baseline spiking observed in visTRN
neurons. Optogenetic visTRN inactivation eliminated this differential
inhibitory response (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 10c, n 5 3 mice,
.82 trials). Overall, our data support the model that thalamic gain
control can be explained by feedforward inhibition and that the TRN is
the source of this inhibition. More generally, to our knowledge, this
experiment constitutes the first measurement of inhibitory dynamics
in freely behaving animals.
Seminal studies have shown the thalamus to be more than a cortical
relay27,28. By providing a mechanistic circuit dissection of thalamic
involvement in divided attention, we extend these studies in two directions. First, our findings in mice show the generality of thalamic modulation of attention across mammalian brains. Second, we provide a first
description, with causal circuit dependence, of how prefrontal topdown control changes thalamic inhibitory dynamics to modulate
sensory gain. The specific involvement of prelimbic cortex in this
behaviour, which we further demonstrate through combined optogenetics and chloride photometry (Extended Data Fig. 10d), does not
eliminate the possibility that the OFC and the ACC may be engaged in
other types of top-down control, potentially via cortico-cortical interactions5. In addition to regulating sensory gain, prelimbic control of
thalamic inhibition may regulate the degree by which relay nuclei
participate in large-scale functional interactions17.
The ability to directly measure [Cl–]i dynamics provided access to a
critical biological variable: GABAA-mediated synaptic inhibition.
Although photometry has already been introduced into neuroscience
for measurement of [Ca21]i in cell bodies and terminals25, FRET-based
chloride photometry has not been performed previously. In this study,
developing chloride photometry was essential for establishing a direct
physiological link between visTRN and LGN spiking (technical discussion in Supplementary Information).
Thirty years ago, Francis Crick proposed that the TRN functions as a
‘searchlight’, directing the internal spotlight of attention to thalamocortical circuits that process ongoing behavioural demands19. Owing
to technical limitations, this transformative model has been difficult to
test, particularly under conditions where the attentional spotlight shifts.
Our study combined novel and established technology to provide
mechanistic details for Crick’s ‘searchlight hypothesis’, thereby contributing to understanding the circuit mechanisms of sensory selection.

RESEARCH LETTER
METHODS
Animals. VGAT-ChR2 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and
maintained on a C57Bl6/J background. VGAT-Cre mice were backcrossed to
C57Bl6/J mice for at least six generations. For experiments in Fig. 1, a total of
fifteen animals were trained, ten of which were later used to establish psychometric
functions (four for divided attention; six for reversal learning). For Fig. 2, four
VGAT-ChR2 mice were used for disruption of PFC and primary sensory cortices
and three mice were used for inactivating LGN. In Fig. 3, four VGAT-Cre mice
were used for electrophysiological recordings from optogenetically identified
visTRN neurons, of which two were used for combined electrophysiological
recordings with optogenetic PFC inactivation (Fig. 3c–e). An additional six mice
were used for optogenetic activation or inhibition of visTRN (three per manipulation) during behaviour (Fig. 3f–g). Four wild-type mice were used for LGN
recordings (Fig. 4). For fibre photometry experiments (Fig. 5), six mice were
injected with AAV-hSyn-SuperClomeleon for behavioural and pharmacological
experiments and three YFP control mice were used. Including all animals used for
Extended Data figures, a total of 28 male mice, 1.5–6 months old, were trained on
the cross-modal task. All experimental procedures involving animals were performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at the New York University Langone Medical Center and the US
National Institutes of Health.
Behavioural training and testing. Behavioural setup. Experiments were conducted in a custom-built trapezoidal testing chamber (base 1, 12 cm; base 2,
25 cm; height, 25 cm) positioned over a grid floor. The testing chamber contained
three nose-pokes, each of which consisted of an infrared LED/infrared phototransistor pair (Digikey, Thief River Falls, Minnesota) for response detection.
Activation of a central nose-poke located on the grid floor, 6 cm away from the
reward wall, was required for trial initiation. Two headphone speakers
(Skullcandy, Park City, Utah) embedded in the floor delivered biasing cues binaurally. Two white LEDs (Mouser, El Cajon, California) were mounted 6.5 cm apart
on the base wall below two additional nose-pokes. Liquid reward consisting of
10 ml evaporated milk was delivered directly to these wall-mounted nose-pokes via
a single-syringe pump (New Era Pump Systems, Farmingdale, New York). Access
to these response nose-pokes was restricted by a rotating, servo-controlled (Tower
Hobbies, Champaign, Illinois) disc (radius, 7 cm). Rewards could be accessed from
these nose-pokes only when two holes in the rotating disc were aligned with the
underlying nose-pokes. Trial logic was controlled by custom software running on
an Arduino Leonardo microcontroller (Ivrea, Italy).
Training. Mice were food restricted to 85–90% of their ad libitum body weight
before training. Training consisted of multiple levels. First, mice were habituated
to the test box and allowed to collect reward freely. Reward availability was signalled by the rotation of the aforementioned wall-mounted disc. The location of
reward (left or right poke) was indicated by either a visual or an auditory stimulus.
For ‘attend to vision’ (visual) trials, the rewarded response poke was indicated
by illumination of the LED mounted underneath it. In ‘attend to audition’ (auditory) trials, an upsweep (10–14 kHz, 500 ms) indicated a reward on the left and a
downsweep (16–12 kHz, 500 ms) indicated a reward on the right. To facilitate
discrimination learning, sweeps were initially presented in a directional manner.
Trials were given in single-modality blocks of six, with alternating block type
(that is, six visual trials followed by six auditory trials; Extended Data Fig. 1, top
row). The stimulus was presented until the animal collected the reward. An individual trial was terminated 20 s after reward collection and a new trial became
available 5 s later. Second, mice learnt to poke to receive a reward. All other
parameters remained constant. An incorrect poke had no negative consequence.
By the end of this training stage, all mice collected at least 20 rewards per
30-minute session.
Third, mice were trained to initiate individual trials, allowing for the establishment of a temporal window in which they could anticipate subsequent delivery of
the stimuli. For successful initiation, mice had to break the infrared beam briefly
(50 ms) in the initiation poke to trigger stimulus presentation and rotation of the
wall-mounted disc. Mice were informed about trial availability and modality type
by brown noise (10-kHz low-pass-filtered white noise, visual trial) or blue noise
(11-kHz high-pass-filtered white noise, auditory trial) delivered binaurally. At this
stage, modality types were arranged in a non-conflicting block design (Extended
Data Fig. 1, top row). Correct poking resulted in reward delivery, whereas incorrect
poking resulted in immediate termination of the trial by disc rotation, blocking
access to reward. Rewards were available for 15 s following correct poking, followed by a 5-s intertrial interval (ITI). Incorrect poking was punished with a timeout, which consisted of a 30-s ITI. Mice could not initiate new trials during an ITI.
To avoid development of side preferences, the target stimulus would appear at the
same location as it did on the previous trial following an incorrect response. After
one week of training on this stage, mice successfully associated the target stimuli

G2015

with the appropriate reward location (Extended Data Fig. 1, top row). At this stage,
directionality of sound stimuli did not affect performance.
Fourth, mice had to resolve sensory conflict. Auditory and visual target stimuli
were always presented in a conflicting manner (Extended Data Fig. 1, middle row).
The brown and blue noise cues indicated the modality to be selected. During
a session, four different trial types were presented in blocks in repeating order:
(1) three auditory trials, (2) three visual trials, (3) six conflict trials with an auditory
target and (4) six conflict trials with a visual target. To prevent modality preferences, an incorrect response resulted in the repetition of the same trial type,
thereby specifically increasing the block length of the trial types with weak performance. This training stage was introduced to teach mice to attend only to the
target modality during a conflict trial. Over the course of this training stage
(1 week), the duration of the target stimuli was successively shortened to 3 s, 1 s
and 0.5 s. In parallel, the time that mice had to break the infrared barrier in the
initiation nose-poke was continually increased and randomized to a final range of
0.5–0.7 s, rendering the precise presentation time of target stimuli unpredictable.
Once mice performed successfully on conflict trials (Extended Data Fig. 1, middle
row) the single-modality trials were removed and block length was reduced to
three trials. This change in the training paradigm was made to facilitate learning of
the trial-type cueing (brown and blue noise).
On the fifth and final stage of training, all block structure was removed and trial
type was randomized (Extended Data Fig. 1, bottom row). We used three measures
to ensure that mice followed the trial-type cueing and did not employ simple
alternating strategies. In addition to computing overall accuracy (Extended Data
Fig. 1, graphs on left), we quantified the number of consecutive correct trials
(Extended Data Fig. 1, middle column) and calculated the fraction of correct
modality switches (Extended Data Fig. 1, graphs on right). At this final stage,
rewards were available for only 5 s.
Psychophysics. For experiments determining the visual detection psychometric
function, the ratio between visual and auditory trials was adjusted from the typical
1/1 to 4/1 to facilitate the acquisition of a larger number of visual trials while
maintaining the divided-attention nature of the task. In addition, visual stimulus
duration was shortened to 0.1 s and the light was randomly displayed at one of five
different intensities (0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2 lm). To establish the comparison
between psychometric functions of visual-only and divided-attention trials
(Fig. 1c), we trained mice that reached criterion (.70% accuracy) on the crossmodal task to perform a visual-only task. For one week, mice were trained on a
visual-only task every other day; trials containing only visual target stimuli were
cued by broadband white noise. Subsequently, visual-only trials were introduced
into the cross-modal task at a 1/4 ratio and in a random interleaved manner. Mice
were found to differentially anticipate visual-only and visual target with auditory
conflict trials (Fig. 1c), whereas they continued to perform equally well on conflict
trials with an auditory target (Extended Data Fig. 3).
To separate the effect of anticipating a conflicting stimulus (top-down) from the
presence or absence of a distracting stimulus itself (bottom-up), we performed two
experiments. In the first experiment, mice performed the cross-modal task with
70% conflict trials and 30% in which conflict was expected but auditory distraction
was removed (Fig. 1d). In the second experiment, mice that had been trained on
the cross-modal task had the biasing cues replaced with broadband white noise
and the modality rewarded was changed on a session-by-session basis such that
mice would deduce it based only on reward history (Fig. 1e).
Behavioural analysis and determination of visual detection threshold.
Performance in behavioural tests was assessed based on the fraction of correct
responses relative to chance level or guess rate (50%, c). The visual detection
threshold (a) and maximum performance (l) were estimated by fitting performance across stimulation intensities with a logistic function29,30:
F ðx; a, b, l, cÞ~cz

ð1{c{lÞ
1zexpð{bðx{aÞÞ

where x corresponds to the five stimulus levels expressed as a percentage of
maximum stimulus intensity. The fraction of correct trials as a percentage of all
trials was summed across sessions and the overall performance as a function of
stimulus intensity was fit using maximum likelihood estimation30 implemented in
the Palamedes psychophysical toolbox (http://www.palamedestoolbox.org/).
Estimation of the distribution of the a parameter was made via non-parametric
bootstrap analysis of curve fits (Fig. 1). To adjust for variable lapse rates (Extended
Data Fig. 2), the fraction of correct trials was normalized so that the minimum and
maximum performance rates corresponded to 50% and 100%, respectively31.
Curve fitting and estimation of the a parameter then proceeded as described above.
Model selection for the number of psychophysical parameters was based on the
Akaike information criterion20,32.
Optogenetics in behaviour. For experiments with optical stimulation (Fig. 2),
testing conditions were equivalent to the final stage of training. Laser trains of

either blue (for ChR2 activation) or yellow (for eNpHR3.0 activation) light consisting of 50-Hz 18-ms pulses (90% duty cycle) at an intensity of 5–6 mW (measured at the tip of the optic fibres) were delivered on every other trial. On laser
trials, stimulation occurred either during the anticipatory period (0.5–0.7 s) or
during stimulus presentation (0.5 s). Because behaviour and recording systems
were automated and stimulus sequence and optogenetic manipulations varied on a
trial-by-trial basis, researchers were not blinded to the conditions. In the case of
multiple sequential pharmacological or optogenetic manipulations in the same
animals, tests were performed in a predefined, pseudorandom order. For comparisons of multiple groups, Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance was used to
assess variance across groups before pairwise comparisons. Power analysis based
on effect size estimates was used to determine sample size required for statistical
significance with a power of b 5 0.7; more than three samples were required to
detect significant differences.
Electrophysiology and optical chloride measurements in behaviour. For combined TRN recordings with optogenetic PFC disruption (Fig. 3d, e), laser trains of
blue light (as described earlier) were delivered during the anticipatory period on
every other trial. For electrophysiological recordings of LGN units and fibre photometry measurements, visual stimuli were presented through illumination of
diffusion-coated wide-angle 3-mm flat-top LED lights (LightHouseLEDS,
Washington), fixed directly on the head of the mouse and centred 8 mm from
the eyes. The LEDs mounted on the base wall of the behavioural box were turned
off in this condition. These changes allowed emitted light to activate ,150u of the
visual angle when the eye is centred at rest33.
Viruses. For retrograde optogenetic tagging and TRN manipulation, FuGB2pseudotyped retrograde lentiviruses (RG-LV) were used as described previously20.
visTRN neurons were labelled through injection (0.4–0.6 ml) of RG-LVEF1a-DIO-ChR2-GFP (for activation) or RG-LV-EF1a-DIO-eNpHR3.0-eYFP
(for inactivation) into the primary visual thalamus (anterior–posterior (A–P),
22.1 mm; medial–lateral (M–L), 62 mm; dorsal–ventral (D–V), 2.5 mm) using
a quintessential stereotactic injector (QSI, Stoelting, Wood Dale, Illinois).
Coordinates are referenced to Bregma. For combined electrophysiological recordings with optogenetic PFC disruption during behaviour, 0.4 ml AAV2-hSyn-DIOChR2-GFP (titre, 1012 vector core per ml) was injected into the PFC (A–P, 2.6 mm;
M–L, 60.25 mm; D–V, –1.25 mm). To measure chloride flux in the LGN, the
transgene SuperClomeleon (gift from G. J. Augustine25) was cloned into the
AgeI and EcoRI restriction sites of an AAV-hSyn-SSFO-eYFP plasmid to obtain
AAV-hSyn-SuperClomeleon. The SuperClomeleon recombinant AAV was packaged as serotype 2 (University of North Carolina, Vector core facility; titre, 1012
vector core per ml) and 0.6–0.7 ml virus was injected into the visual thalamus.
Following injections, mice were allowed to recover for 2–4 weeks to allow for
virus expression.
Optic fibre implant experiments. Mice were anaesthetized using 1% isoflurane
and mounted on a stereotactic frame. For cortical inactivation experiments, up to
three pairs of 4–5-mm-long optic fibres (Doric Lenses, Quebec, Canada) were
inserted bilaterally to target up to three different brain areas per mouse (prelimbic
cortex, 2.6 mm A–P, 60.25 mm M–L, –1.25 mm D–V; primary visual cortex,
–3.5 mm A–P, 62.50 mm M–L, –0.50 mm D–V; primary auditory cortex,
–2.8 mm A–P, 64.00 mm M–L, –2.00 mm D–V; AAC, 0.5 mm A–P, 60.25 mm
M–L, –1.00 mm D–V; lateral OFC, 2.6 mm A–P, 61.50 mm M–L, –2.00mm D–V;
primary visual thalamus, –2.1 mm A–P, 62.00 mm M–L, –2.50 mm D–V;
visTRN, –1.6 mm A–P, 62.20 mm M–L, –3.00 mm D–V). Two or three stainless
steel screws were implanted into the skull to anchor the implant and were fixed
with dental cement. Animals were allowed to recover and training resumed one
week later. For ChR2 activation a 473-nm laser was used and a 561-nm laser was
used for eNpHR3.0 activation (Omicron-Laserage, Dudenhofen, Germany).
Drive construction. Custom drive housings were designed using 3D CAD software (SolidWorks, Concord, Massachusetts) and printed in Accura 55 plastic
(American Precision Prototyping, Tulsa, Oklahoma) as described previously20,34.
Prior to implantation, each drive was loaded with 8–12 independently movable
microdrives carrying up to 3 nichrome (12.5 mm) and/or tungsten (25 mm) stereotrodes (California Fine Wire Company, Grove Beach, California). Stereotrodes
were pinned to custom-designed 32- or 64-channel electrode interface boards
(EIB; Sunstone Circuits, Mulino, Oregon) along with a common reference wire
(A-M systems, Carlsborg, Washington). For optogenetic tagging, an optical fibre
was embedded adjacent to the stereotrode array. In these cases, the optic fibre
extended 3.5 mm from the base of the drive so that it could be stereotactically
positioned above the TRN during implantation. Targeting of the TRN or LGN was
achieved by guiding stereotrodes and optic fibres through a square array of polyimide sleeves attached to the base of the drive body.
Drive and fibre implantation for optical activity measurements. Prior to surgical implantation, mice were anaesthetized with 1% isoflurane and placed in a
stereotactic frame. Stainless steel screws were implanted into the skull to provide

G2015

electrical and mechanical stability for the drives. For drive implantations, craniotomies (,3 mm 3 2 mm) were drilled, centred at –2 mm A–P and 2.5 mm M–L
for TRN recordings (15u angled implantation) and at –2.3 mm A–P and –2.5 mm
M–L for LGN recordings. The dura mater was carefully removed and drives were
centred at the craniotomy coordinates using a custom stereotactic arm. Drive
bodies were slowly lowered into the craniotomy until stereotrode tips were
,500 mm below the cortical surface and optical fibres were positioned just above
the TRN (2.5 mm D–V). For fibre-photometry-based optical recording, lowinternal-fluorescence optic fibres (400 mm diameter) (Doric Lenses, Canada) were
implanted just dorsal to the LGN (–2.2 mm A–P, 2.15 mm M–L and 2.6 mm D–V)
following virus injection.
Electrophysiological recordings. After mice had recovered from implantation
surgery, recordings were made using a Neuralynx multiplexing digital recording
system (Neuralynx, Bozeman, Montana). Signals were acquired using a 32- or 64channel digital headstage connected to the implanted EIB. Signals from each
electrode were amplified, filtered between 0.1 Hz and 9 kHz and digitized at
30 kHz. Local field potential signals were obtained from a single wire per stereotrode. Following implantation, stereotrode sets were incrementally lowered from
the cortex into the target thalamic structure over the course of 1–2 weeks
(Extended Data Fig. 5). Spike sorting was performed offline following acquisition
based on relative spike amplitude and energy within electrode pairs using the
MClust toolbox (http://redishlab.neuroscience.umn.edu/mclust/MClust.html).
Following manual clustering, cross-correlation and autocorrelation analyses were
used to confirm adequate separation.
Optogenetically tagged visTRN units were identified based on ChR2-mediated
response to stimulation using a 473-nm analogue-modulated laser (OmicronLaserage, Dudenhofen, Germany)20. Laser light was delivered by a 200-mm optic
fibre targeted to the TRN (Extended Data Fig. 5) connected to a fibre optic patch
cord (200-mm core, Doric Lenses, Quebec, Canada). The laser intensity was set at
,8 mW optical output power measured at the patch cord terminus. Fibres were
polished before implantation so that the power at the tip was $50% maximum,
resulting in ,4–5-mW laser light being delivered to the brain. Only neurons that
showed clear transient responses to laser stimulation were included in the analysis.
Analysis of firing rate. Changes in firing rate during task performance were
assessed for 138 identified visTRN neurons recorded from four animals and 119
LGN neurons in two animals. Peri-event time histograms aligned to trial initiation
and to stimulus presentation were computed using a 5-ms bin width for individual
neurons in each recording session4. Separate histograms were created for correct
and incorrect trials within auditory and visual target stimuli and convolved with a
Gaussian kernel (8 ms half-width at half-height) to create a spike density function35,36. The average firing rate across trials was determined during the anticipation window before stimulus presentation. The evoked response amplitude was
estimated by averaging the firing rate within a 100-ms window starting 20 ms after
stimulus onset. Window duration was chosen based on the latency-to-peak response for point stimuli in the mouse LGN37.
For normalized rate changes in TRN neurons, firing rates during the attentional
window in each trial were compared with the baseline firing rate (5-s window, 0.5 s
before task initiation). Statistical comparison of firing rate changes was used to
identify neurons with significant task-associated changes in firing rate via nonparametric comparison of firing rate during the attentional window and the baseline period38. The test statistic (W) was calculated based on ranking of all trials (N)
and comparison was performed using the sign function (sgn):


Á: Ã
 Â À
sgn x2,j {x1,j Rj 
W~


where x1 and x2 were the attentional window and baseline firing rate, respectively,
and R denotes the rank. The threshold for significance was set at 0.05 and significantly modulated units were defined as neurons in which the test statistic was less
than the critical value for the sample size (Walpha(0.05)). Comparison of firing rates
across trial types (for example, visual versus auditory correct) was performed using
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Homogeneity of variance for firing rates across
conditions was determined using the Fligner–Killeen test of homoscedasticity.
Analysis of visual evoked potentials. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were
computed from the broadband LGN local field potential (LFP; 0.1 Hz–10 kHz).
The particular stereotrode used for VEP analysis in behaviour was selected based
on the amplitude of responses in post-task recordings during which there were
many more trials included. Task-related VEPs were averaged during correct auditory and visual trials across recording sessions. To determine peak response,
the lowest negative-potential offsets associated with the visual response39
(0–250-ms window) were identified on a trial-by-trial basis. Signals from individual trials were smoothed with a 25-ms half-width filter over the response
window before obtaining the peak offset40.

Histology. Mice were euthanized and transcardially perfused with PBS followed
by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were dissected, post-fixed overnight at 4 uC and
sectioned using a vibratome (LEICA, Buffalo Grove, Illinois).
For GFP enhancement, immunofluorescent staining was carried out on
50-mm-thick sections using chicken anti-GFP (1/1,000, GFP-1020, Aves).
Sections were incubated overnight with primary antibody in PBS-T (10% normal
goat serum and 0.05% Tween20) at 4 uC. Detection of primary antibodies was
carried out with Alexa-Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1/1,000, A-11039,
Invitrogen). All sections were imaged on a Zeiss LSM510 META confocal
microscope.
Fibre-photometry-based optical chloride measurements. FRET-based measurement of chloride was performed during behaviour using a custom-designed fibre
photometry system24. A fibre-coupled LED (Thorlabs, Newton, New Jersey) light
source, filtered using a 434-nm clean-up filter (MF434-17 Thorlabs, Newton, New
Jersey), was used for CFP excitation. Excitation light was split via a long-pass
dichroic mirror (DMLP425, Thorlabs, Newton, New Jersey) and coupled to a
400-mm, 0.48-NA (pharmacology) optic patch cord (Doric lenses, Canada) linked
to a 400-mm chronically implanted optical fibre. Excitation and emission light were
conveyed by a single patch cord linking the fibre photometry system to the
implanted fibre. SuperClomeleon CFP and YFP emissions25 were separated using
a single-edge beam splitter (FF511-Di01, Semrock, Rochester, New York). Each
emission wavelength was independently focused onto a separate femtowatt silicon
photoreceiver (Newport, Irvine, California) using custom optics (12.7-mm focal
length plano-convex lens mounted in Thorlabs SM1NR05 lens tube). The light
signal was digitized and recorded using a TDT signal acquisition system (TuckerDavis Technologies, Alachua, Florida). Signal bandwidth was limited to ,750 Hz
based on the photoreceiver response characteristics. The fluorescence ratio was
calculated across the recording period. To minimize the effect of slow fluctuations,
normalized delta fluorescence (df/F) was calculated for evoked responses relative to
the baseline fluorescence level before each event (1-s window). Traces were
smoothed with a convolution filter (50 ms half-width). Peak response (Extended
Data Fig. 10) was estimated as the minimum over a 500-ms window following
stimulus onset. For pharmacological activation of GABAA receptors with 4,5,6,7tetrahydroisoxazolo(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol (THIP), baseline fluorescence was estimated
over 5 minutes before injection. For visual stimulation, light pulses of 100-ms
duration were displayed to the ipsi- or contralateral side of the recorded LGN.

G2015

Effects of the GABAA receptor antagonist flumazenil on visual evoked responses
were quantified by comparing the average peak response from
5 minutes before injection (baseline) to one within a 5-minute time window around
the maximal response suppression (maximal drug effect) and at the end of the
recording session (recovery, at least 100 min after injection). For optogenetic manipulations of frontal cortical structures, smaller-diameter patch cords (200 mm, 0.37
NA) were used to allow movement and prevent tangling. For these recordings,
power analysis was performed to determine sample size required to detect significant differences with a power of b 5 0.7 based on the observed differential signal in
correct auditory and visual trials under baseline conditions. Analysis indicated that
more than four independent samples would be required to detect a change in these
differential responses.

natural errors compared to errors due to PFC disruption. a–c, Scatter plots
showing the change in absolute firing rate for visTRN neurons for correct (a),
incorrect (b) or disrupted-PFC trials (c). Insets show the cumulative probability

lower firing rate in ‘attend to vision’ than in ‘attend to audition’ trials (n 5 138,

trials (n 5 138, P , 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test); this suggests that perhaps
the animal was attending to the wrong modality. This reversal was not observed
in trials with PFC disruption (despite mouse performance being at chance

Extended Data Figure 7 | The effect of PFC disruption on visTRN activity is
distinct from naturally occurring errors. a, Scatter plots of response from
visTRN neurons, comparing the modulation of their firing rate (change from
baseline) under the two distinct anticipatory conditions. Each sample is a
single cell. Colours denote significance reached for each cell on a trial-by-trial
basis (red, visual; blue, auditory; purple, both; rank-sum-test comparison to
baseline). Note that in correct performance (n 5 138, 4 mice, P , 0.005,
Wilcoxon signed-rank test), ‘attend to vision’ resulted in a negative shift and

G2015

‘attend to audition’ resulted in a positive shift, consistent with examples shown
in Fig. 3. During naturally occurring error trials, the modulation is partially
reversed for both trial types, suggesting that at least a subset of errors are
the result of attending to the wrong modality. In contrast, PFC disruption
(n 5 56 cells, 2 mice) resulted in a weaker, non-uniform effect (‘attend to visual’
trials are less affected). b, Quantification of effects seen in a. N.S., not

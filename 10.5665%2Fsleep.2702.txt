Spindles are oscillations dominating EEG activity during stage
2 of sleep, and they are also present during slow-wave sleep
(SWS). Multiple data point to their thalamic origin and their
modulation by cortical activities, in particular by the slow oscillation. Detailed analyses of spindles have revealed the presence of both slow (9-12 Hz) and fast (12-15 Hz) spindles, with
different topographical distributions over the scalp. In humans,
fast spindles dominate centroparietal regions, while slow spindles dominate at frontal areas during SWS.1,2
In this issue of SLEEP, Ayoub and colleagues3 demonstrate
that in sleeping subjects, a reduction in the efficacy of Na+
channels reduced fast spindles in central and parietal cortices,
but enhanced slow spindles in frontal areas and slow oscillation
over investigated regions. By contrast, a reduction in the efficacy of Ca2+ channels (primarily T-type) did not affect slow oscillation or slow spindles, but it decreased fast spindles power
in central regions, in particular during SWS. These results point
to differences in mechanisms generating slow and fast spindles,
and they raise a question relative to whether all spindles have
the same mechanism of generation.
The “classical” model of spindle generation has stood for
many years. In cats anesthetized with barbiturates, spindle
activity of 8-12 Hz dominates over frontal areas and over the
suprasylvian gyrus. Electrical stimulation of intralaminar thalamic nuclei induced augmenting responses similar in appearance to spindles. These findings suggested a possible role of
the thalamus in initiating of spindle activities.4 Independent of
the type of anesthesia, after a full decortication of cats, spindle
activity persists in the thalamus.5,6 Within the thalamus, spindles are generated as follows: low-threshold Ca2+-dependent
spike burst (LTS) in reticular thalamic nucleus induces IPSPs
in thalamocortical neurons, which in turn generate rebound LTS
that drives the next Ca2+ spike in the reticular thalamic nucleus.7
Importantly, isolated reticular thalamic nucleus can generate
oscillations with spindle frequencies,8 because at hyperpolarized voltages, intra-reticular nucleus inhibition has a depolarizing action that is sufficient to drive LTS.9 Cortical neurons are
synchronously excited by thalamocortical neurons that generate
cortical field potential spindles. The cortical network is not just

passively reflecting thalamic spindles. Rather, it drives spindle
onset,10 particularly during slow oscillation,11 and it also effectively contributes to the spindle termination.10,12
There are many inconsistencies between the “classical”
model of spindle generation and recent results. (a) The classical model does not explain the different frequencies of fast and
slow spindles. It could be explained by different dynamics in
small ensembles of thalamic neurons,13 but exact data on these
different dynamics are missing. (b1) Global slow waves occur
most conspicuously in early sleep, while global spindles occur prominently during late sleep.14 (b2) In relation to global
slow waves, slow spindles occur primarily at a transition toward silent states, while fast spindles occur mainly at the onset
of active states.1,2 This suggests that only fast spindles fit in the
“classical” description as being heavily controlled by cortical
activities. (c) Evidence from EEG and MEG recordings15 led to
a hypothesis that EEG spindles are generated by matrix (nonspecific) thalamic nuclei, but MEG spindles are generated by
core (specific) thalamic pathways.16 (d) Optogenetic stimulation of the reticular thalamic nucleus may trigger cortical spindle activities, which are not detected in corresponding thalamic
sites.17 (e) Finally, in this issue of SLEEP, Ayoub et al. reported
that Na+ and Ca2+ antagonists differently influence fast and slow
spindles.3 Only fast spindles were reduced after administration
of a Ca2+ channel blocker, pointing to a “classical” LTS-dependent mechanism of their generation.
The inconsistencies between the classical model and recent
results on spindle control have raised an important question—do
all spindles, in particular slow spindles, require an active thalamic contribution? Figure 1A shows a segment of local field potential recordings from a sleeping cat. In agreement with properties
of “classical” spindles, within the suprasylvian gyrus short fast
spindles (14-16 Hz) were faithfully following slow waves, while
simultaneously recorded activities in medial prefrontal cortex
generated slower spindles (12-14 Hz) that did not interact with
the slow oscillation. In the case of slow spindles, calculating their
distribution in relation to global slow waves1,2 would suggest
their occurrence at the end of an active cortical state and even
during a silent state. Figures 1B and 1C show separately recorded
spindles from a cat anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine with addition of propofol. In agreement with the classical mechanism of
generation, field potential spindles in the motor cortex occurred
simultaneously with thalamic ones, and phased-locked multiunit
firing of thalamocortical neurons occurred during both depicted
spindles recorded from the corresponding ventro-lateral (VL) nucleus (Figure 1B). By contrast, spindles in the medial prefrontal
cortex were not accompanied with vigorous field potential oscil-

If projecting thalamic nuclei are not involved in the generation of slow frontal spindles, what would be their origin?
Slow spindles could potentially be generated within nonspecific (matrix) thalamic nuclei; however, given the wide cortical
projections from these nuclei, one should expect synchronous
spindles appearance over wide cortical areas, which is not
demonstrated yet. Another option is that a set of intracortical
mechanisms might be responsible for the generation of slow
spindles. The cortical origin of sleep slow oscillation is well
accepted. The study by Ayoub et al.3 in this issue demonstrates
that a reduction in the efficacy of Na+ channels enhances both
slow oscillation and slow spindles. Although exact cellular
mechanisms of this phenomenon are not clear, this finding suggests that similar cellular mechanisms or structures might be
responsible for the generation of both sleep slow oscillation and
sleep slow spindles. Future studies could shed light on the possibilities of the intracortical origin of slow spindles.

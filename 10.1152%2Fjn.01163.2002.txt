Li, Jianli, Martha E. Bickford, and William Guido. Distinct
firing properties of higher order thalamic relay neurons. J Neurophysiol 90: 291–299, 2003. First published March 12, 2003;
10.1152/jn.01163.2002. It has been proposed that the thalamus is
composed of at least two types of nuclei. First-order relay nuclei
transmit signals from the periphery to the cortex while higher order
nuclei may route information from one cortical area to another.
Although much is known about the functional properties of relay
neurons in first-order nuclei, little is known about relay neurons
belonging to higher-order nuclei. We investigated the electrophysiological properties of relay cells in a higher-order thalamic nucleus
using in vitro intracellular recordings from thalamic slices of the rat’s
lateral posterior nucleus (LPN). We found neurons of the LPN possess
many of the same membrane properties as first-order relay neurons.
These included low-threshold calcium spikes (IT) and burst firing, a
mixed cation conductance (IH) that prevented membrane hyperpolarization, and a transient Kϩ conductance that delayed spike firing (IA).
The repetitive firing characteristics of LPN neurons were more distinct. One group of cells, located in the more caudal regions of the
LPN responded to depolarizing current pulses with a train of action
potentials or in a regular spiking (RS) mode. This form of firing
showed a steep but highly linear increase in firing frequency with
increasing levels of membrane depolarization. Another group of cells,
located in the more rostral regions of the LPN, responded to depolarizing current pulses with clusters of high-frequency bursts or in a
clustered spiking (CS) mode. The overall firing frequency rose nonlinearly with membrane depolarization, but the frequency of a given
burst remained relatively constant. The caudal LPN receives input
from the superior colliculus, whereas the rostral LPN receives input
from layers V and VI of the visual cortex. Thus the RS and CS cells
may be driven by subcortical and cortical inputs respectively, and the
distinct temporal properties of their response modes may be a necessary component of the LPN circuitry.

INTRODUCTION

It has been proposed that nuclei of the dorsal thalamus can
be divided into two general types. First-order nuclei convey
sensory information to the cortex, while higher-order nuclei
may contribute to the transfer of information from one cortical
area to another (Guillery and Sherman 2002). Although anatomical distinctions between these nuclei are well established,
there has been little attention given to the possibility that cells
in these nuclei possess different functional properties.
Much is known about the electrophysiological properties
and firing characteristics of first-order neurons, such as
thalamocortical (relay) cells in the dorsal lateral geniculate
nucleus (LGN). These cells transmit retinal signals to the

visual cortex by means of single spike (tonic) or burst firing
response modes (McCormick and Feeser 1990; Sherman 2001;
Steriade and Llina´s 1988). Tonic firing prevails at depolarized
membrane levels and ensures a relatively accurate transfer of
retinal signals. Burst firing, a high-frequency barrage of action
potentials that ride the peak of a low-threshold Ca2ϩ spike,
occurs at more hyperpolarized levels and introduces a highly
nonlinear form of signaling. Burst and tonic modes play a key
role in thalamic signaling and underscore how first-order relay
neurons actively modulate the gain and efficacy of signal
transmission. However, few studies have explored the firing
modes and intrinsic membrane properties of higher-order relay
cells (Hu 1993; Monckton and McCormick 2002; Zhu and
Heggelund 2001). To examine the electrophysiological properties of cells in a higher-order thalamic nucleus, we made in
vitro intracellular recordings of relay cells in the rat lateral
posterior nucleus (LPN).
The LPN receives visual input from the retinorecipient zone
of the superior colliculus as well as the visual cortex (Li and
Bickford 2001; Li et al. 2003; Mason and Groos 1981; Takahashi 1985). The LPN is considered a higher-order nucleus
because it is innervated by two different types of cortical
terminals that originate in layers V and VI (Bourassa and
Descheˆnes 1995; Guillery 1995; Li et al. 2003). It has been
proposed that higher-order thalamic neurons are distinct from
first order thalamic neurons because their response properties
may be driven by cortical rather than subcortical inputs
(Guillery 1995).
METHODS

Long Evans rats ranging in age from postnatal day 18 – 47 were
anesthetized with halothane and killed by decapitation. The brain was
excised and a block of tissue containing the thalamus was removed,
and placed in a cold (4°C) oxygenated solution of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2,
1 MgSO4, 26 NaH2PO4, and 10 dextrose at a pH of 7.4. Thalamic
slices were prepared on a vibratome (Leica, VT 1000E, Deerfield, IL)
as 400-␮m-thick coronal or parasagittal sections. Slices were placed
on nylon mesh designed to fit inside a well of a temperature controlled
recording chamber (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA). Tissue was
maintained in an interface of warmed (35°C) humidified air (95%
O2-5% CO2) and oxygenated ACSF. Recordings began 2 h after slices
were placed in the recording chamber.
Examples of thalamic slices containing the LPN and our basic
experimental approach are shown in Fig. 1. We used coronal or

parasaggittal slices to obtain intracellular recordings from neurons
within the LPN. Sharp-tipped electrodes made of borosilicate glass
(Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and filled with 4 M KAC or a 2%
solution of biocytin dissolved in 2 M KAC were used to record
intracellular voltage responses. Electrodes were pulled horizontally
(P97, Sutter Instruments) to a final impedance of 60 –120 M⍀. Intracellular responses were collected in current-clamp mode with a highimpedance amplifier (Axoclamp 2B, Axon Instruments, Union City,
CA) using techniques described elsewhere (Guido et al. 1997, 1998).
Neuronal activity was digitized at 10 kHz (Instrutech VR10B, Port
Washington, NY) and stored directly on computer. Current and voltage data were acquired and analyzed using pulse and pulsefit (HEKA,
Port Washington, NY) software programs. Adjustments in membrane
potential were controlled by injecting DC current through the recording electrode. Current-voltage relations were examined at different
membrane potentials by injecting a series of square wave current
pulses (Ϯ1 nA, 0.01- to 0.1-nA steps, 300 –700 ms) to reach steady
state. The voltage responses to these current steps were also used to
determine the presence and operating range of voltage gated conductances and to explore the repetitive firing characteristics of LPN cells.
In some instances, the Kϩ channel blockers apamin (250 –500 ␮M)
tetraethylammonium (TEA; 10 mM) or 4-aminopiridine (4-AP, 500
␮M to 1 mM) were applied locally into the interface recording
chamber. In other experiments, NiCl2 (1–2 mM) or CsCl (2 mM) were
added to the bath.
During intracellular recording, some LPN neurons (n ϭ 51) were
filled with biocytin by passing alternating positive and negative current pulses (Ϯ1 nA, 30 ms, 100 –300 pulses) through the recording
electrode. Slices containing biocytin filled cells were placed in a
fixative solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(PB) for 48 h and processed using the ABC method (Guido et al.
1997; Horikawa and Armstrong 1988). Labeled cells were photographed and drawn using a camera lucida attachment. Soma sizes
were measured using a digitizing tablet and SigmaScan software
(SPSS, Chicago, IL).
To stain cells in the LPN that contained gamma amino butyric acid
(GABA), two rats were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium
(30 mg/kg) and perfused through the heart with tyrode solution
followed by a fixative solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and 1%
glutaraldehyde in PB. The brain was removed and 50-␮m-thick sections were cut with a vibratome. The sections were incubated overnight in a 1:4,000 dilution of a rabbit-anti-GABA antibody (Sigma
Chemical, St. Louis, MO). The next day the sections were incubated
in a biotinylated goat-anti rabbit antibody for 1 h, ABC for 1 h, and
reacted with nickel enhanced diaminobenzidine. GABA stained somata were drawn and measured as described in the preceding text.

hyde in PB. The brain was removed and 50-␮m-thick sections were
cut on a vibratome. The sections were incubated overnight in a
1:3,000 dilution of a mouse-anti-parvalbumin antibody (Sigma). The
next day the sections were incubated in a biotinylated goat-anti mouse
antibody for 1 h, ABC for 1 h, and reacted with nickel enhanced
diaminobenzidine.
RESULTS

We recorded the voltage responses of 94 neurons in the
LPN. Of these, 51 were filled with biocytin. Examples of
biocytin-filled cells are shown in Figs. 2B and 8. The soma size
distribution in Fig. 2C indicates that all labeled cells were
larger than those stained for GABA (Fig. 2A), a neurotransmitter used by thalamic interneurons (Montero and Zempel
1985). Biocytin-labeled cells in the LPN also had multipolar
dendritic arbors consistent with those of class A thalamocortical cells (Grossman et al. 1973; Webster and Rowe 1984).
Taken together, these results indicate our recordings were
made from thalamic relay cells.
Intrinsic membrane properties of LPN cells
The voltage responses to square-wave current pulses were
used to explore the passive and active membrane properties of
LPN relay neurons. Examples are shown in Figs. 2–5. Measurements of these responses revealed that input resistance
(55 Ϯ 19M⍀; n ϭ 94), resting membrane potential (Ϫ60 Ϯ 4
mV; n ϭ 67), and spike amplitude (64 Ϯ 7mV; n ϭ 80) are
similar to those of LGN relay neurons (Williams et al. 1996).
An examination of I-V relations also indicated substantial
nonlinearities in the voltage responses to current pulses (Fig.
2E). Indeed, LPN cells possessed many of the same voltagegated conductances found in first-order relay neurons (McCormick 1992; Williams et al. 1996). This included delayed firing
in response to depolarizing current pulses (Fig. 2D, a), and a
hyperpolarization-activated depolarization (Fig. 2D, b) and
rebound burst firing (Fig. 2D, c) in response to hyperpolarizing
current pulses.
All recorded LPN cells displayed a low-threshold (LT) Ttype Ca2ϩ conductance. Activation gave rise to a large triangular depolarization and burst firing at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. Passive membrane repolarization on termination of a hyperpolarizing current pulse of sufficient strength

and duration evoked large “rebound” LT spikes and burst
firing. These events were also activated by a depolarization
from a steady hyperpolarized state (see Fig. 5). LT spikes could
be blocked by bath application of Ni2ϩ (n ϭ 3, data not
shown), indicating they are mediated by a T-type Ca2ϩ channel
(IT) (Hernandex-Cruz and Pape 1989).
LPN neurons (54/55) also displayed a hyperpolarizationactivated depolarization. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, hyperpolarizing current pulses produced a strong inward rectifying
response. This “depolarizing sag” was blocked by bath application of Csϩ (n ϭ 3), thus indicating LPN cells possess the
mixed cation conductance IH (McCormick and Pape 1990).
Many LPN neurons (33/47) showed a substantial delay in
action potential firing in response to a depolarizing current step
(Fig. 3, C–F). These delays were voltage dependent and
brought about by an outward rectification during strong membrane depolarization. Figure 3E shows the latency (L) in firing
varied with the intensity of injected current and could be fitted
to an exponential decay curve (r ϭ 0.93). These delays in firing
were abolished by the local application of 4-AP (n ϭ 4; Fig.

3F), suggesting they are mediated by the transient Kϩ conductance, IA (McCormick 1991).
Repetitive firing properties of LPN cells
LPN cells exhibited some repetitive firing properties that
were distinct from first-order relay neurons. Examples of the
firing patterns of LPN neurons are shown in Fig. 4. One group
of cells (n ϭ 71) responded to depolarizing current pulses with
a steady train of action potentials and a firing frequency that
varied linearly with membrane depolarization (Fig. 4A). We
refer to this form of firing as a “regular spiking” (RS) mode.
Firing frequency by current injection plots for RS cells have
relatively steep slopes and a large linear operating range (Fig.
4C). These features can in part be attributed to the lack of spike
frequency adaptation in their spike trains. Figure 4E shows the
interspike intervals for RS cells remained relatively constant
with the passage of each spike in a train at different levels of
membrane depolarization.
Another group of LPN cells (n ϭ 23) exhibited what we
refer to as a “clustered spiking” (CS) firing mode in which

FIG. 3. Activation of the mixed cation conductance
IH and delayed spike firing in LPN relay cells. A: voltage
responses of LPN cell recorded before (control), during,
and after (recovery) the bath application of Csϩ (2 mM).
During control responses, membrane hypepolarization
activates a strong inward rectifying response. This depolarizing sag was blocked by Csϩ, suggesting this
response is mediated by the mixed cation conductance
IH. The depolarizing sag during membrane hyperpolarization recovers during wash-off. B: plot showing the
degree of inward rectification associated with IH. Membrane potentials were measured 20 ms before the end of
the current pulse. C and D: examples of LPN cells
showing a substantial delay in firing in response to a
depolarizing current pulse. E: a plot showing the latency
to spike firing (L) against injected current for the cell in

curve (r ϭ 0.93). F: responses to depolarizing current
pulses before (control) and after the local application of
4-aminopyrindine (4-AP, 500 ␮M). In the control response, depolarization leads to a large delay in spike
firing. This delay is reduced by 4-AP, indicating the
involvement of the Kϩ conductance IA.

depolarizing current pulses evoked epochs of high-frequency
spike discharges (Fig. 4B). These intermittent clustered discharges were separate and distinct from those that ride the peak
of LT Ca2ϩ spikes (Fig. 5, A and B), and the firing rates of
these clusters (ϳ100 Hz) were lower than the firing frequency
of bursts associated with LT Ca2ϩ spikes (ϳ400 Hz). Firingfrequency plots reveal that CS cells responded in a nonlinear
manner with firing rates that increased either quadratically
(Fig. 4D) or exponentially (not shown) with membrane depolarization. This increase in firing rates resulted from an increase in the number of clusters and/or an increase in the
number of spikes within a cluster. As illustrated in Fig. 4F, CS
cells displayed a form of spike-frequency adaptation. Although
the firing frequency within the first cluster remained relatively
constant, there was an increase in the interspike interval of
subsequent clusters.
When hyperpolarized to levels more negative than Ϫ65mV,
depolarizing current pulses evoked LT bursts in both RS and
CS cells (Fig. 5, A and B). However, when larger (sustained)
current pulses were applied to hyperpolarized RS and CS cells,
their responses were distinct. In this situation, LT bursts were
followed by RS or CS firing respectively (Fig. 5, C and D).

We noted two measures that were correlated with the different firing modes. First, the half-width of the action potential
(duration measured at half-amplitude) was greater for CS cells
(mean: 1.21 ms) than for RS cells (mean: 0.73 ms). Second, the
afterhyperpolarization potential (AHP) duration for RS cells
(mean: 56.72 ms) was greater than that of CS cells (mean:
15.74 ms). These differences are illustrated in Fig. 6, which
plots the duration of AHPs against the half-width of action
potentials for RS and CS cells.
Further examination of the AHPs of RS and CS cells revealed heterogeneity that could be distinguished in part by their
duration and underlying pharmacology. As illustrated in Fig. 7,
A–D,, RS cells showed the most variable AHPs. Some RS
neurons displayed a very slow AHP (Fig. 7, A–C), lasting
87.0 Ϯ 21.2 ms (n ϭ 13), which corresponds to previous
descriptions of a medium AHP (mAHP) (Sah 1996; Stocker et
al. 1999). AHPs of this length have not been reported in LGN
relay neurons (Descheˆ nes et al. 1984; Williams et al., 1996).
As illustrated in Fig. 7, B and C, the AHP of some RS neurons
appeared to have fast and slow components that were separated
by a small afterdepolarization. For other RS cells, we observed
a single AHP of more intermediate length (iAHP, Fig. 7D)

and spike half-width for RS and CS cells. The plot illustrates that RS and CS

which lasted 38.0 Ϯ 11.6 ms (n ϭ 21). As indicated in Table
1 and Fig. 7E, CS cells had the fastest AHP (fAHP) we
observed that lasted 15.7 Ϯ 4.9 ms (n ϭ 15).

We investigated the conductances underlying these AHPs by
applying various Kϩ channel antagonists. The results of these
experiments are summarized in Fig. 7, F–H. The nonspecific
Kϩ channel blocker, TEA significantly reduced (P Ͻ 0.001)
the amplitude of the fAHP (Fig. 6F, 10.0 Ϯ 1.7 to 7.3 Ϯ 2.3
mV, a 27% reduction, n ϭ 4). TEA also widened the action
potential (half-width from 1.0 Ϯ 0.2 to 2.5 Ϯ 2.1 ms, n ϭ 4,
P Ͻ 0.001). Another nonspecific Kϩ channel blocker, 4-AP,
was more effective in reducing the amplitude of the fAHP
(8.2 Ϯ 2.9 to 4.2 Ϯ 1.8 mV, a 49% reduction, n ϭ 5, P Ͻ
0.001) and did not affect action potential width (Fig. 7G).
Finally, the small-conductance calcium-activated Kϩ channel
blocker, apamin, reduced the amplitude and duration of the
mAHP (111 Ϯ 24 to 59 Ϯ 13 ms, n ϭ 3, P Ͻ 0.001) while
leaving the width of the action potential and the amplitude
of the fAHP intact (Fig. 7H). These results suggest that the
variety in the duration of the AHPs recorded in LPN neurons
can be attributed to the presence of several different potassium
channels.

Distribution and morphology of recorded LPN neurons
We then examined the firing characteristics of LPN neurons
in relation to their location in LPN. In the rodent LPN, rostral
regions receive input from the cortex and caudal regions receive input from the superior colliculus (Li and Bickford 2001;
Li et al. 2003; Mason and Groos 1981; Takahashi 1985). In
experiments carried out in coronal slices, we noted that RS
cells tended to be located in more caudal levels of the LPN,
whereas CS cells seemed to be located in more rostral regions.
However, this trend was difficult to quantify in brains cut in the
coronal plane. To confirm that RS and CS cells are segregated
in the LPN, we did experiments in slices cut in the parasaggittal plane. A typical experiment is illustrated in Fig. 8. We
found that CS cells were located exclusively in the rostral LPN
(Fig. 8, red symbols), whereas RS cells were dispersed
throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the LPN (Fig. 8, yellow
and green symbols). On closer examination, we found that cells
firing in the RS mode could be further subdivided by correlating their rostral-caudal location with the duration of their
AHPs. RS cells with a medium AHP (Ͼ60 ms; RSm, n ϭ 32)
were located only in the caudal LPN (Fig. 8, green symbols),

while RS cells with an intermediate AHP (Ͻ60 ms; RSi, n ϭ
39) were more dispersed throughout the LPN (Fig. 8, yellow
symbols).
With cells divided into three categories, we re-examined
their membrane properties and these are summarized in Table
1. The AHPs for RSi, RSm, and CS cells differed significantly
from each other (t-test, P Ͻ 0.001). The half-width of the
action potential also differed between both groups of RS cells
and CS cells (t-test, P Ͻ 0.001). However, there were no
significant differences in the resting membrane potential, input
resistance, or amplitude of action potentials among any of the
groups. Moreover, all cells exhibited IT and IH and the majority
of cells within each group displayed IA (54 –79%, see Table 1
and Fig. 3, C and E). We also failed to detect any consistent
correlation between the firing characteristics and morphology
of LPN neurons. Figure 8 provides examples of camera lucida
drawings of a biocytin filled CS (Fig. 8A), RSi (Fig. 8B), and
RSm (Fig. 8C) cell. While there is an inherent variability in
dendritic morphology among these cells, they are indistinguishable from class A thalamocortical relay cells (Grossman
et al. 1973).

DISCUSSION

The present report provides the first detailed description of
the functional properties of relay neurons in the LPN, a proposed higher-order nucleus. We found that relay neurons of the
LPN possess many of the same voltage-gated conductances
that have been reported for first-order relay neurons of the
LGN. Most notable was the presence of the mixed cation
conductance IH and the LT T-type Ca2ϩ conductance that
underlies burst firing. In the LGN, the interplay of these conductances with GABAergic inhibition originating from the
thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) promotes intrinsic oscillatory
activity that occurs during certain behavioral or pathological
states (McCormick and Bal 1997). It has previously been
shown that the synaptic targets of TRN terminals are similar in
first- and higher-order nuclei (Wang et al. 2001). These results
taken together with the present report suggest that higher-order
thalamic relay neurons can engage in rhythmic events similar
to those described in first-order nuclei, and thus contribute to
the widespread distribution of thalamic oscillatory activity.
Despite these similarities, we did note that the repetitive
firing characteristics of higher-order LPN relay neurons differed from first-order LGN relay neurons. We found that cells
in the LPN fired linearly in a RS mode or nonlinearly with
epochs of high-frequency bursts in a CS mode. The bursting
associated with the CS mode differs from the conventional LT
Ca2ϩ mediated burst mode of thalamic relay neurons. While
both forms of bursting are highly nonlinear, their temporal
patterning and voltage dependency differ substantially (McCormick and Feeser 1990).
The RS mode of LPN relay neurons also differs from the
tonic mode of LGN neurons. Firing frequency by current
injection plots for regular spiking cells are steeper and exhibit
a much larger linear operating range (McCormick and Feeser
1990; Zhan et al. 1999). The tonic firing of LGN neurons also
shows substantial spike frequency adaptation (Smith et al.
2001; Zhan et al. 1999), a feature that was not apparent in the
regular spiking of LPN neurons. These differences may be
attributed to the relative strength and density of various Kϩ
conductances involved in the regulation of the f- and mAHPs
of thalamic relay cells.
Previous studies have noted that LGN interneurons display
longer AHPs than LGN relay cells (Williams et al. 1996). The
AHPs of interneurons are similar in some ways to the AHPs of
the RS cells. However, in the LPN we did not observe the slow
voltage ramp that occurs prior to the start of each action
potential. In addition, the duration of action potentials for LPN
cells was greater than those of interneurons. Similarly, the
responses of LPN CS cells are reminiscent of the responses of
“fast spiking” cortical interneurons (Kawaguichi 1995; McCormick et al. 1985). However, the width of the action potentials
of CS cells is wider than that of parvalbumin-containing fastspiking interneurons (Galarreta and Hestrin 2002) and no neurons in the LPN stain for parvalbumin (see Fig. 1).
The response profile of CS cells in the rodent LPN more
closely resembles the firing mode of relay cells in the dorsolateral nucleus of the avian thalamus (Luo and Perkel 2002). In
addition, responses similar to CS LPN neurons have been
recorded in relay cells located within the shell region of the cat
ventroposterior lateral nucleus (VPL) (Turner et al. 1997).

Because responses similar to CS cells have not been recorded
in well-characterized first-order thalamic nuclei such as the rat
LGN (Crunelli et al. 1987; Williams et al. 1996) or ventrobasal
complex (Velazquez and Carlen 1996), it raises the possibility
that the rat LPN and the shell region of the cat VPL share
properties distinct from first order nuclei. Some areas of the
primate VPL are innervated by two types of cortical terminals
(Darian-Smith et al. 1999) and thus might be considered higher
order (Guillery 1995). However, this information is unavailable for the cat VPL. At this point, we can confidently state that
within the rat visual thalamus, the firing properties of higherorder relay neurons are distinct from those of first-order relay
neurons. Whether this distinction will hold true for thalamic
nuclei representing other sensory modalities, or indeed whether
the first-order/higher-order distinction applies to all thalamic
regions, requires further investigation.
We are also confident that the LPN cell responses that we
observed were recorded from relay cells rather than interneurons. First, all of our biocytin-filled cells were larger than
GABAergic interneurons. Second, their dendritic morphology
was consistent with that of first order thalamocortical cells.
Finally, we previously noted that GABAergic interneurons in
the LPN are much sparser than in the LGN, and are virtually
absent in the rostral LPN (Li et al. 2003).
This lack of interneurons in the rostral LPN is worth noting
because this is the region where CS cells are concentrated. The
rostral LPN also receives dense input from the visual cortex (Li
et al. 2003; Mason and Groos 1981; Takahashi 1985). This
includes inputs from cortical layer V cells that do not project to
first-order thalamic nuclei but do provide large “driver-like”
inputs to higher-order nuclei (Guillery and Sherman 2002)
such as the LPN (Bourassa and Descheˆ nes 1995; Li et al.
2003). Higher-order nuclei of the visual thalamus project
densely to cortical layer I (Abramson and Chalupa 1985),
where the apical dendrites of layer V cells end in tufts (Klein
et al. 1986). Thus the high-frequency bursts of CS cells could
be particularly effective in activating layer V cells (Swadlow
and Gusev 2001; Thomson 2000). It is possible that the response characteristics of CS cells are important for strengthening and maintaining cortico-thalamo-cortical signals through
the rostral LPN.
In contrast, RS cells are located in more caudal levels of the
LPN. In particular, RS cells with the slowest AHPs (RSm cells)
are clustered in the most caudal LPN. This region of the LPN
receives input from the retinorecipient zones of the superior
colliculus (Li and Bickford 2001; Mason and Groos 1981;
Takahashi 1985). In fact, the firing characteristics of RSm cells
are similar to the firing characteristics of tectothalamic cells
(Lo et al. 1998). Such firing may be important for the accurate
transfer of these signals through the caudal LPN to the cortex
and/or striatum (Takada 1992). Thus in the LPN, RS and CS
cells may be driven by subcortical and cortical inputs, respectively, and the distinct temporal properties of their response
modes may be a necessary component of circuits that are
unique to higher-order nuclei.

Most CNS systems, including the trigeminal–somatosensory system, develop via a hierarchical order (from the periphery and up the
neuraxis). We tested the hypothesis that development of the trigeminal system can proceed via a nonhierarchical mechanism (i.e., that
neuronogenesis can occur postnatally). Preweanling rats were perfused, and brain sections were stained with cresyl violet or immunolabeled with NeuN (for neuronal counts), or processed for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity or p75 immunoreactivity [to identify
boundaries of the ventrobasal nucleus (VB)]. Neuronal number decreased during the first postnatal week but increased 2.5-fold over the
next 3 weeks. To determine whether this remarkable rise resulted from the generation of new neurons, preweanlings were given injections
of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) on postnatal day 6 (P6) or P21. BrdU-positive VB cells were apparent on both days. Cumulative BrdU
labeling showed that the cell cycle was 17.3 h on P6. Moreover, Ki-67, a protein elaborated throughout the cell cycle, was expressed by
25.8 –29.3% of all VB cells on P6 –P15, falling to 7.7% by P21. BrdU-positive VB cells coexpressed neuronal markers: NeuN, HuC/D,
microtubule-associated protein 2, and a dextran placed in the somatosensory cortex. Note that postnatal neuronal generation was also
evident in other thalamic nuclei (e.g., the lateral geniculate nucleus). Thus, the developing VB experiences two periods of neuronal
generation. Prenatal neuronogenesis is part of hierarchical trigeminal–somatosensory development. Postnatal nonhierarchical neuronogenesis is intrathalamic and matches changes in neuromodulatory systems (exemplified by AChE activity and p75) and the arrival of
corticothalamic afferents.

Introduction
Development of components of the trigeminal–somatosensory
system proceeds in a hierarchical order (i.e., up the neuraxis).
This order is evident in the sequence of neuronogenesis. In the
rat, most second-order neurons in the principal sensory nucleus
of the trigeminal nerve (PSN) and spinal trigeminal nuclei are
generated between gestational day 12 (G12) and G14 (Nornes
and Morita, 1979; Altman and Bayer, 1980; Miller and Muller,
1989). Third-order neurons in the ventrobasal nucleus of the
thalamus (VB) are generated on G14 and G15 (Altman and
Bayer, 1989), and fourth-order neurons in layer IV of the somatosensory cortex, the primary target of afferents from the VB,
are born on G17 and G18 (Miller, 1988). Like neuronogenesis,
death of postmigratory neurons proceeds hierarchically. It peaks
in the PSN, VB, and cortex neonatally (Ashwell and Waite, 1991;
Miller and Al-Ghoul, 1993; Miller, 1999), during the middle of

the first postnatal week (Waite et al., 1992; Mai et al., 1998), and
at the end of the first postnatal week (Finlay and Slattery, 1983;
Ferrer et al., 1990; Miller, 1995; Miller and Kuhn, 1997),
respectively.
Overlap in the timing within each stage of development of
trigeminal–somatosensory components allows for feedforward
passage of information (e.g., the thalamus affects cortical development via ingrowth of thalamocortical axons). One advantage
of this hierarchical pattern is the matching of neuronal numbers
among components of the system (Wetts and Herrup, 1983).
That is, the number of VB neurons is matched to the number in
the brainstem, and cortical neuronal numbers are matched to the
number of VB neurons.
Interestingly, some systems (e.g., olfactory and hippocampal)
have a nonhierarchical aspect to their development. In these
structures, proliferating neural stem cells (NSCs) produce neurons that are continually integrated into the adult system
(Schlessinger et al., 1975, 1978; Hinds and McNelly, 1977, 1981;
Miller, 1995; Kempermann et al., 1996; Luskin, 1998; Kornack
and Rakic, 1999, 2001a). Apparently, these new neurons are critical for maintaining neural plasticity. The development of the
visual pathway also exhibits a nonhierarchical component
(Fitzgibbon, 2006). The perigeniculate nucleus matures before its
afferent sources and its target.
Neuromodulatory systems are expressed during postnatal VB

postnatal neuronogenesis.

Materials and Methods
Animals

Pregnant Long–Evans rats were obtained from Harlan Sprague Dawley
(Indianapolis, IN) on G4. The day that a sperm-positive plug was first
seen was defined as G1. Animals were maintained in an Association for
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-approved facility at the Syracuse Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the VAMC and the Committee on the Humane Animal Use at
Upstate Medical University.
At birth, litters were culled to 10. Offspring were weaned on postnatal
day 21 (P21). To ensure a common scale for the developmental timeline,
G22 was designated as P0 regardless of the actual day of birth. One animal
from each of five litters was perfused transcardially with 4.0% paraformaldehyde in 0.10 M phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.4, at various times between P0
and P21. Each brain was removed, postfixed in buffered paraformaldehyde
for 4 h, cryoprotected, and stored in 30% sucrose in PB.

Cell proliferation studies

Prenatal neurogenesis. Four dams were given injections of [ 3H]thymidine
([ 3H]dT) on each day during the period between G13 and G17 inclusive.
[ 3H]dT was used for these studies because it is ideal for use in birthdating
studies wherein it is necessary to discriminate first-generation neurons
from succeeding generations (Miller, 1985, 1988). An offspring from
each litter was killed on P21. These animals were used to verify prenatal
times of generation of VB neurons.
Postnatal neurogenesis. One animal from each of three litters was given
an injection of the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 25 mg/
kg; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) on P6 or P21. BrdU was appropriate for these
studies because it lent itself to short-term studies of cell proliferation and
for fluorescence labeling studies (Miller and Nowakowski, 1988). These
animals were perfused at various times (2– 6 h or 3 or 15 d) after the
injection. Sections were collected as described below. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize dual expression of BrdU and one of various cell type-dependent and developmental state-dependent markers
(Table 1).
One animal from each of three litters that received an injection of
BrdU on P6 also received an intracerebral injection of biotinylated dextran (0.020 ␮l of 1.0 mg/100 ␮l saline; D1956; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA)
on P24. Animals were perfused 1 week after dextran injection, and brains
were processed for double immunofluorescence.
Three animals from two different litters were used to assess cell cycle
kinetics. These animals received injections of BrdU (25 mg/kg) on P6.
Thirty minutes later, one animal from each litter was perfused, and the
brain was collected. Two hours after the first injection, the remaining

Tissue preparation

Using a Leica (Nussloch, Germany) CM1900 cryostat, sets of 12-␮mthick sections of the forebrain were collected from each brain. The periodicity of the series varied among the different ages: at P0 and P3, every
10th section was taken; at P6, every 15th section was taken; and at P12
and later, every 20th section was collected. One set was stained with cresyl
violet for counting neurons. A second set was stained to localize acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity for delineation of the boundaries of the
developing VB. Third, fourth, fifth, and sixth sets of sections were immunolabeled for NeuN or HuC/D (markers for mature neurons), Ki-67 (a
marker for cells in all phases of the cell cycle), p75 (the low-affinity
neurotrophin receptor), and pan–trk (the high-affinity neurotrophin
receptors). Other sets were used in the double-labeling studies (see
below).

AChE histochemistry
Sections were incubated in the stain solution containing 0.50 mg/ml
acetylthiocholine iodide, 0.10 M sodium acetate, 0.10 M acetic acid, 0.10 M
sodium citrate, 30 mM copper sulfate, 4.0 mM tetraisopropylpyrophosoamide, and 5.0 mM potassium ferricyanide, pH 5.5 (El-Badawi and
Schenk, 1967; Mooney and Miller, 1999). This incubation was performed
in the dark at 37°C for 3 h. Subsequently, tissue was dehydrated through
graded alcohols and cleared before coverslipping. Differential thalamic
AChE staining was used to delineate the borders of the VB, specifically
the medial and lateral segments of the ventral posterior nucleus (VPm
and VPl, respectively) (Kristt, 1983). The VB was identified using the
criteria described by Paxinos and Watson (1982).

Immunohistochemistry
Sections were immunolabeled for markers identifying stage-specific
cells. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating sections in 0.01 M citrate
buffer, pH 6.0. Nonspecific antibody binding was quenched by a wash in
PB containing 0.10% Triton X-100 (TPB), 4.0% goat serum, and 1.0%
bovine serum albumin. Sections were incubated for 1 h with a primary
antibody directed against p75, pan–trk, Ki-67, BrdU, NeuN, or HuC/D
(Table 1). Unbound antibody was removed by washing in 5.0% nonfat
milk in PB (mPB). Biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was applied for 1 h. Sections were rinsed in
mPB and incubated with a Vectastain Elite kit (Vector Laboratories).
Immunoreactivity was visualized by incubating the sections in 3,3Јdiaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories) in the presence of hydrogen
peroxide. Sections were counterstained with cresyl violet. All steps were
performed at room temperature. Nonspecific labeling was examined by
omitting either the primary or the secondary antibody.
To determine the identity of the dividing cells, dual immunofluorescence was used to colocalize BrdU with markers for immature and ma-

ture neural cells. Nonspecific antibody labeling was blocked by incubation in TPB containing 4.0% goat serum and 1.0% bovine serum
albumin. All sections were treated with 0.0070N NaOH to produce
single-stranded DNA and incubated in an antibody to BrdU on singlestranded DNA. The BrdU immunolabel was visualized with a secondary
antibody conjugated with fluorescein. Subsequently, the sections were
processed with a second primary antibody for a cell type-specific marker
(Table 1) and a rhodamine-tagged secondary antibody. Sections were
also labeled with bis-benzamide (1:400 in PB; Hoescht 33341, B2261;
Sigma), a DNA marker, to label all nuclei and thus allow determination
of a cytoarchitectonic area. For the double-labeling studies with the dextran, the dextran was conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:200
in PB; 016-070-084; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove PA) and the
BrdU with a primary antibody and a secondary antibody conjugated to
Texas Red strepavidin (1:200 in PB; Fl6000; Vector Laboratories). Fluorescent immunolabeling was visualized with a Zeiss (Thornwood, NY)
Axioplan 2E Imaging fitted with appropriate filters and structured illumination (Zeiss Apotome) or with a Leica microscope outfitted with a
confocal laser (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

Tritiated-thymidine autoradiography

The brains of the offspring of rats given injections of [ 3H]dT were removed, embedded in paraffin, and cut into a series of 10 ␮m sections.
The sections were deparaffinized, dehydrated, cleared, rehydrated, and
dipped in NTB2 Nuclear Track Emulsion (Kodak, Rochester, NY). The
autoradiographs were developed for 25–28 d, fixed, cleared, dehydrated,
counterstained with cresyl violet, and coverslipped.

Data analyses
Labeling frequencies. The labeling frequency for VB cells expressing BrdU
or Ki-67 was determined in brains collected 6 h after injection of BrdU on
P6 or P21 using the Bioquant Image Analysis system (R&M Biometrics,
Nashville, TN). Counts were made of the total number of neurons within
a square box (100 ϫ 100 ␮m) and the number of cells immunopositive
for BrdU or Ki-67. The labeling frequency was calculated as the number
of immunopositive cells divided by the total number of neurons counted.
Autoradiographic analyses. Cells were identified as being heavily or
lightly labeled depending on the relative number of grains overlying
them (Miller 1985, 1988). Heavily labeled cells had greater than half the
maximal number of grains over their nuclei. These cells were presumed
to have been in their final mitosis when the [ 3H]dT was injected. Lightly
labeled neurons had less than half the number of grains as that over the
most heavily labeled neurons and more than double background. Conservatively, background was two grains per nucleus (i.e., two grains per
50 ␮m 2). Cells were lightly labeled (1) if they underwent more than one
mitotic division subsequent to the [ 3H]dT injection or (2) the somata of
a heavily labeled neuron was too deep in the section to be detected as
heavily labeled (e.g., the crown of the nucleus only broached the upper 2
␮m of the section, the zone that affects the overlying emulsion).
Stereological methods. The boundaries of the VB were determined in
the AChE- and cresyl violet-stained sections using the Bioquant Image
Analysis system. Each image was projected to a monitor, and the borders
of the VB and its subnuclei (VPm and VPl) were traced. Cavalieri’s estimator of volume was used to calculate the volume (VT) by the following
formula:

VT ϭ ⌺ai ϫ sf,
where ai is the cross-sectional area of the thalamic nucleus on the ith
profile and sf is the mean distance between sections (section thickness
multiplied by the inverse of the periodicity of sections in the series).
A corrected number of neurons (Ncorr) was estimated using Smolen’s
correction to Floderus’s formula (Smolen et al., 1983; Miller and Muller,
1989; Mooney and Miller, 1999). The formula was as follows:

¯ Ϫ 2k͒,
N corr ϭ ͑n ϫ t͒/͑t ϩ D
where n is the number of neurons counted in sampled areas (the count¯ is the mean maximal diameter,
ing boxes), t is the section thickness, D
and k is the diameter of the smallest recognizable cap of a cut nucleus.

J. Neurosci., May 9, 2007 • 27(19):5023–5032 • 5025

The density of neurons (NV; also called a cell packing density) was
determined from the following formula:

NV ϭ Ncorr/(#boxes ϫ Vbox),
where Vbox is the volume of one counting box (area of counting frame by
section thickness).
The estimated total number of neurons in the VB, VPm, or VPl (NT)
was calculated as the product of the total volume of the VB (or a subnucleus) and the cell packing density:

NT ϭ NV ϫ VT.
Cell cycle kinetics. The total length of the cell cycle (TC) was determined
using a cumulative BrdU labeling technique (Nowakowski et al., 1989;
Siegenthaler and Miller, 2005). BrdU incorporates into DNA of cells
passing through the S phase, and over time, all cycling cells take up the
label. The timing of the incorporation (i.e., the temporal change in the
number of cells that take up BrdU) depends on the cell cycle kinetics. The
data for the numbers of cells that incorporated the BrdU shortly after
one, two, or three injections of BrdU were used to calculate the TC.
Counts did not endeavor to differentiate among cell types (e.g., NSCs,
neurons, or glia); however, endothelial cells were eliminated from the
tallies. The labeling index (LI) was determined for BrdU-immunolabeled
sections from animals treated with multiple BrdU injections. The total
number of cells and the number of BrdU-positive cells in a 100 ϫ 100 ␮m
counting box were counted. The LI was calculated as the number of
BrdU-immunolabeled cells divided by the sum of the numbers of labeled
and unlabeled cells.
Conventionally, the proportion of cells that are actively cycling, the
GF, is determined by the cumulative labeling method that relies on the
saturation of the cycling population with BrdU via a series of periodic
injections (Nowakowski et al., 1989). To use fewer animals and to examine the change in the growth fraction (GF) over time, in the present study
the GF was determined using Ki-67 labeling. Empirical data show that the
number of cells expressing Ki-67 is the same as the number of cells that
are cumulative labeled with BrdU (Siegenthaler and Miller, 2005). Accordingly, the LI for Ki-67 was determined at four ages: P6, P12, P15, and
P21.
Statistical analyses. Only one rat per litter was used in generating any
particular datum. The means (SEMs) were calculated for VT, Nv, NT, TC,
and GF and for the proportion of neurons generated on a particular
gestational day. A one-way ANOVA was used to examine the effect of age.
In situations of statistical significance, specific post hoc comparisons were
performed using t tests.

Results
Appearance of the developing VB
The VB was discernible in cresyl violet-stained sections of the
preweanling brains (Fig. 1). Throughout the early postnatal period, the VB was nestled in the crook of the internal capsule and
the zona incerta. During the first postnatal week, the two subnuclei, the VPm and VPl, were difficult to distinguish in the cresyl
violet; however, by the second postnatal week, the two subnuclei
had distinctive appearances. The neuronal packing density was
not significantly different between the subnuclei; however, between P6 and P21, the cross-sectional area of profiles of both the
nuclei and somata of neurons in the VPm was ϳ30% greater than
those of neurons in the VPl.
The pattern of AChE staining changed over time. In the neonate, the VB was richly AChE positive. In fact, at this time, the VB
was more intensely stained than any of the adjacent thalamic
nuclei. Moreover, as early as P0, the VPl was darker that the VPm.
This differential was detectable during the first postnatal week. By
age P12, the VPm had noticeably lost its staining intensity, and by
P21, the staining pattern was characteristic of the mature VB (i.e.,
both subnuclei were paler than surrounding thalamic nuclei) (cf.
Kristt, 1983; Mooney and Miller, 1999).

5026 • J. Neurosci., May 9, 2007 • 27(19):5023–5032

The temporal change in the distribution of p75 immunolabeling was similar to
that of AChE activity (Fig. 1). In the neonate, p75 was richly expressed in the VPm.
Staining intensity decreased with age, and
by P21 there was no detectable p75 immunoreactivity in the VB. This spatiotemporal pattern of staining agrees with that described previously (Crockett et al., 2000).
In contrast to the pattern of AChE staining, p75 immunoreactivity in the young
pup was rich in the VPm and virtually absent in the VPl. Labeling with the pan–trk
antibody, which labels all three highaffinity neurotrophin receptors (trkA,
trkB, and trkC), showed the same spatiotemporal pattern as seen with p75. Trk expression was high in the young animal and
attenuated by the third postnatal week
(data not shown).
[ 3H]dT labeling of prenatally
generated neurons
Neurons in the two subnuclei of the VB
were heavily labeled by injections of
[ 3H]dT on either G14 or G15 (Fig. 2).
Heavily labeled neurons were seen in both
the VPm and VPl after [ 3H]dT injection
on G14 or G15. Similar numbers of neurons were born on each day. No heavily
labeled neurons were evident in the VB after an injection on G13, G16, or G17 (data
not shown).

Figure 1. Appearance of the VB. The VB was identifiable by a distinctive pattern of AChE activity and p75 immunolabeling. Both
AChE and p75 were highly expressed in the VPl and the VPm, respectively, during the first postnatal week. Labeling waned during
the second postnatal week and was absent by P21. p75 expression was also evident in the border neurons of the globus pallidus
(GP) and the LGN, particularly the dorsal subnucleus (dLGN). The latter labeling fell temporally, as did the labeling in the VB. Cresyl
violet-stained sections were used for stereological analysis. H, Habenula; Hip, hippocampal formation; IC, internal capsule; vLGN,
ventral LGN; ZI, zona incerta. Scale bars, 1.0 mm.

Numbers of neurons in the VB
The total number of neurons in the VB was
calculated as the product of the volume of
the VB and the mean cell packing density.
The total volume of the VB increased 10fold during the first postnatal month (F(5,20) ϭ 80.427; p Ͻ 0.001)
(Fig. 3). The volume of each subnucleus also increased over this
time. Moreover, during the first three postnatal weeks, the VPm was
consistently (1.41- to 1.72-fold) and significantly ( p Ͻ 0.05) larger
than the VPl.
Concomitant with the increase in the VB volume, there was a
progressive decrease in the neuronal packing density with age
(F(5,20) ϭ 147.22; p Ͻ 0.001). The biggest decrease occurred during the first postnatal week, and the density evident on P12 was
not significantly different from that in 21- and 30-d-old rats. No
differences between the neuronal packing density in the VPm and
VPl were detected at any age examined.
The number of neurons in the VB was determined by calculating the product of the volume and neuronal packing density.
Accordingly, there was a significant effect of age (F(3,12) ϭ 12.410;
p Ͻ 0.001) on the total number of neurons in the VB. Post hoc
analyses showed that the total number of neurons significantly
( p Ͻ 0.001) fell between P0 and P3. Surprisingly, the number of
neurons increased significantly ( p Ͻ 0.001) between P3 and P12
and then again between P12 and P21. The number of neurons fell
significantly ( p Ͻ 0.05) between P21 and P30 [the latter data
were described in a previous study (Mooney and Miller, 1999)].
To verify that only neurons were included in the analyses of

the cresyl violet-stained sections, sections immunolabeled with
an anti-NeuN antibody were examined. The numbers of VB cells
that were NeuN positive on P12 and on P21 were not significantly
different from numbers determined using sections stained with
cresyl violet.
The change in the number of neurons in the two subnuclei was
determined. As with the overall numbers of VB neurons, the
numbers of neurons in the VPm and VPl rose during the first
three postnatal weeks. Furthermore, over the times examined, the
VPm comprised 1.61-fold more neurons than the VPl.
Postnatal generation of neurons in the VB
BrdU labeling
To address the possibility that neuronal generation occurred in
the VB during the postnatal period, animals received injections of
BrdU on P6 or P21. Six hours after injecting the BrdU, 12.5% of
cells in the VB were labeled by an injection on P6 (Fig. 4). In
contrast, only 1.5% of VB cells incorporated BrdU that was administered on P21. Animals given injections on P6 exhibited
BrdU-positive cells in the VB as early as 30 min after injection,
indicating that the cell proliferation occurred within the VB and
that the cells did not migrate from the ventricular zone (VZ) of
the third ventricle.

Cell cycle kinetics
The combination of cumulative BrdU and
Ki-67 labeling allowed for determination
of the cell cycle kinetics (Fig. 5). During
the 6.5 h after the first injection of BrdU,
the number of BrdU-positive cells increased. By fitting these data to a linear
regression (r ϭ 0.9936; p ϭ 0.0064), the TC
was estimated to be 17.3 Ϯ 0.9 h. This was
similar to that determined for cells in the
cortical VZ on G21 (Miller and Nowakowski, 1991). The LI for Ki-67 (i.e., the
GF) was stable between P6 and P12. The
mean GF was 27.4 Ϯ 0.9%. By P21, the LI
dropped significantly ( p Ͻ 0.01) to 7.7%,
indicating a reduction in the proliferative
population.
Identity of proliferating cells
To determine the identity/fate of BrdUpositive cells, brains were examined 2, 6, or
15 d after injection (i.e., on P8, P12, or
P21). On P8, BrdU mostly colocalized with
markers for NSCs (vimentin or nestin) or

balance of nuclear/perikaryal NeuN immunolabeling was tipped

also evident in pups receiving injections of BrdU on P6 and with
a biotinylated dextran placed in somatosensory cortex on P24
(Fig. 6 and supplemental Fig. 3, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material). The VB of these animals exhibited a subset of BrdU-positive cells that were also dextran positive. This
indicated that the neurons generated postnatally (1) projected to
the cortex and (2) these projection neurons survived for at least 3
weeks. Some cells exhibited BrdU and GFAP immunolabeling or
BrdU and Iba1 immunolabeling.
Cerebral cortex and hippocampus were examined for comparative purposes. BrdU-positive cells in neocortex did not coexpress NeuN, but BrdU-positive/GFAP-positive cells were common (supplemental Fig. 4, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material). The implication is that early postnatal
neurogenesis in cortex leads to the production of glia and not
neurons. In contrast, double NeuN–BrdU labeling was evident in
the hippocampal formation.

Lateral geniculate nucleus
It is noteworthy that the VB was not unique among thalamic
nuclei insofar as its cytoarchitectural and chemoarchitectural development. For example, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)
followed a parallel developmental course to that described for the
VB. The spatiotemporal pattern of both AChE activity and p75
immunoreactivity in the dorsal and ventral LGN was identical to
that for the VPm and VPl, respectively (Fig. 1). Moreover, BrdUand Ki-67-positive cells were common in the LGN throughout
the period from P3 to P21 (data not shown). Double labeling with

BrdU and a neuronal marker was also

was administered on P6 (data not shown).

Discussion
Periods of VB neuronogenesis
VB neurons are generated during two periods. The first period occurs prenatally,
on G14 and G15 (Altman and Bayer,
1989). The second period occurs during
the preweaning period, between P3 and
P21. Over this time, neuronal number increases 2.5-fold.
That VB neurons are generated postnatally is supported by two independent sets
of data: (1) stereological determination of
total neuronal number traces a longitudinal increase in the number of neurons during the second and third postnatal weeks;
and (2) VB neurons incorporate BrdU administered postnatally. It is important to
note that the BrdU is incorporated into
cycling cells (as opposed to cells repairing
their DNA) as evidenced by colabeling of
BrdU with nestin and Ki-67 (Gerdes et al.,
1983, 1984; Scholzen and Gerdes, 2000; Figure 4. Evidence that cells in the VB are cycling. BrdU-positive cells are evident in the VB of an animal given an injection of
BrdU on P6 and killed 6 h later. In contrast, animals receiving injections of BrdU on P21 have few labeled cells. Likewise, the
Siegenthaler and Miller, 2005).

nogenesis is surprising. Although dividing
cells in the postnatal VB have been demonstrated (Altman and
Das, 1966), the identity of these cells has remained unknown
and presumed to be glia. The present study shows that many
cells cycling in the postnatal VB become neurons. Indeed,
colocalization of a dextran transported retrogradely from neocortex with BrdU in thalamic neurons shows that postnatally
generated thalamic neurons not only survive but they integrate into the system.
Source of postnatal neuronogenesis
In contrast to the prenatal generation of VB neurons that occurs
in the diencephalic VZ, postnatal neuronogenesis occurs in the
VB per se. Evidence of BrdU-positive cells in the VB 30 min after
injection shows that cells divide in situ rather than being generated elsewhere (e.g., the VZ) and migrating into the VB. After all,
the cells that incorporate the BrdU are in S phase, and they must
complete the cycle (i.e., pass through G2, M, and the beginning of
G1) before they can migrate. Furthermore, radial migration of
prosencephalic neurons in the rat occurs at a rate of 5– 6 ␮m per
hour (Miller, 1999; Siegenthaler and Miller, 2004), and if the cells
are born in the diencephalic VZ, they must travel a distance of 600
␮m or more. Neither the passage of cells through the remaining
cell cycle nor their migration can be accomplished in 30 min,
much less the sum of both processes. Therefore, the postnatally
generated neurons must have originated in the VB.
Using the cell cycle kinetic data (Fig. 5) and the change in cell
number (Fig. 3), the number of cells produced daily can be estimated. Based on a mathematical model (Miller, 2003), it is estimated that 51,300 cells (i.e., neurons and glia) per day are produced in the VB. Even allowing for gliogenesis and the death of a
fraction of these cells, this production more than explains the
documented addition of 7500 neurons per day.

Figure 5. Cell cycle kinetics for postnatal proliferation in the VB. BrdU incorporation among
cycling cells increases after a series of injections on P6 (solid symbols and line). This is evident by
an increase in the mean LI (SEMs). A regression line was fitted to the primary data, the slope ( m)
of which was the dividend of the GF and the total length of the cell cycle (TC ): m ϭ GF/TC. The GF
was determined as the percentage of cells that was Ki-67 immunoreactive (open circles and
dashed lines). This LI was measured at five times: P6, P9, P12, P15, and P21. It remained at a
steady amount until the end of the third postnatal week when it fell significantly ( p Ͻ 0.01).

Postnatal neuronal generation beyond the VB
Postnatal neural generation is not confined to the VB. BrdU- and
Ki-67-positive cells are present in other structures, notably the
hippocampus, olfactory system, neocortex, and lateral geniculate
nuclei. In essence, the hippocampal formation serves as a positive
control, and the neocortex serves as a negative control.
Postnatal neuronogenesis occurs in nonthalamic parts of the
CNS. Granule neurons of the dentate gyrus are generated in the
subgranular (intrahilar) zone in the early postnatal period and

between expression of the anti-apoptotic
bcl-2 and the pro-apoptotic bax (Mooney
and Miller, 2000). Therefore, this drop can
be attributed to naturally occurring neuronal death (NOND). This death is consistent with a hierarchical sequence in that it
follows the death occurring in the PSN

Immature neurons compete for trophic substances that are in limited supply;
some fail to find sufficient support and die
(Oppenheim, 1991). For VB cells, trophic
substances likely come from somatosensory cortex. Survival of neonatal thalamic
neurons in vitro is enhanced by cortically
conditioned medium (Lotto et al., 1997;
Asavaritikrai et al., 2003). One vital trophic substance in CNS-conditioned medium responsible for the maintenance of
thalamic neurons is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Four independent

the VPm). Thus, whereas BDNF may be
important for the VPm, other systems
(e.g., serotonin transporter systems,
AChE-expressing systems, other growth
factors) may be key for the VPl.
The second wave of neuronal generation is nonhierarchical, at least in the sense
of development following an ascending sequence (periphery 3 brainstem 3 thalamus 3 cortex). On the other hand, this
generation coincides with the establishment of the descending corticothalamic
projection (Jones, 1997; Uziel et al., 2006).
This notion is supported by evidence that
(1) layer VI, the source of most corticothalamic projections, has a considerable
number of neurotrophin-expressing neurons (Pitts and Miller, 1995, 2000) and (2)
the thalamus does not have neurons capable of manufacturing a neurotrophin(s)
(Baquet et al., 2004), but it does have cells
that express neurotrophin receptors (Vitalis et al., 2002; present study). Thus, cortex apparently plays a major role in establishing thalamic structure via a
nonhierarchical mechanism.

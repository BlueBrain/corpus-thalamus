AND S. DEURA. Distribution of calretinin, calbindin-D28k, and parvalbumin in the rat
thalamus. BRAIN RES BULL 33(5) 595-614,
1994.-The
localization of three calcium-binding
proteins, calretinin, calbindinD28k, and parvalbumin, in the rat thalamus was immunohistochemically
examined. a) Some thalamic regions revealed cells almost
exclusively containing one of the calcium-binding
proteins. For example, almost only calretinin-stained
cells were found in the
central medial and paraventricular
nuclei. Calbindin-D28k-stained
cells were mostly found in the centrolateral, interanteromedial,
anteromedial, and posterior nuclei. Only parvalbumin-positive
cells were found in the central part of the reticular nucleus. b) Other
regions expressed overlap between the distributions of two cell components composed of different calcium-binding
proteins. For
example, both calretinin-stained
cells and calbindin-D28k-labeled
cells were found in the lateroposterior,
intermediodorsal,
rhomboid, and reuniens nuclei. c) Other regions showed no cells stained for any of the calcium-binding
proteins. For example, generally
no calcium-binding
protein was detected in neurons of the anterodorsal, anteroventral, ventrolateral, ventral posterolateral, ventral
posteromedial,
or gelatinosus nuclei, or of the central part of the mediodorsal nucleus. These three proteins serve as useful marker
for localizing subpopulations
of neurons within the thalamus.

calretinin, calbindin-D28k,
and parvalbumin, are differentially
distributed in brain regions, it might provide a clue for exploring
the possible functions of these proteins.
In the thalamus of the rat, previous studies have shown that
calretinin (23,43,54), calbindin-D28k (6,10,18) and parvalbumin
(10,15,18) are localized in subpopulations of neurons, although
their localizations have never been extensively examined. In the
present study, we localized immunohistochemically
each of the
calcium-binding
proteins in the rat thalamus using closely
matched sections, and compared their distribution patterns to examine whether a complementarity
exists. The lateral and medial
geniculate nuclei showed rather complicated distribution patterns
of the calcium-binding
proteins [for example, see (2)]; therefore,
a comparison of the distributions in these nuclei will be described
elsewhere.

CALRETININ,
calbindin-D28k,
and parvalbumin
are members
of the EF-hand
family of calcium-binding
proteins (37) and have
restricted
distributions
in neurons of the central nervous system

of the rat (3,10,23,43). The differential distribution of the two
calcium-binding
proteins, calbindin-D28k and parvalbumin, has
been reported in many regions of the central nervous system of
numerous species: of the rat, in the cerebral cortex (Sl), hippocampus (20,48), thalamus (18), and dorsal horn of the spinal cord
(1,55,56); of the cat, in the pulvinar-lateralis
posterior complex
(5) and superior colliculus (34); of the monkey, in the hippocampal formation (46), basal forebrain and midbrain (14), and thalamus (25,41). In the rat hippocampus, furthermore, other pairs
of calcium-binding proteins, calretinin and parvalbumin, and calretinin and calbindin-D28k,
have been shown to form largely
nonoverlapping cell groups (31). Colocalization of calretinin and
calbindin-D28k
in the same neurons has been shown in some
regions of the rat brain, including the substantia nigra, ventral
tegmantal area, and triangular septal nucleus (44). In the cat thalamic reticular nucleus, calbindin-D28k-immunoreactive
cells
are also immunostained for parvalbumin (32).
Although the role of these calcium-binding
proteins in neurons is still unknown, their ability to bind Ca*’ entering the cytosol could buffer intracellular Ca*+ (8). C&C et al. (14) have
revealed that distribution patterns of calbindin-D28k and parvalbumin in the primate basal forebrain and midbrain are complementary and suggested that the two calcium-binding
proteins
may work synergistically.
If the three calcium-binding
proteins,

controls.
Staining Procedure

In order to localize the immunoreactivity of the calcium-binding proteins, neighboring sections of each set were singly stained
for calretinin, calbindin-D28k, parvalbumin, or Nissl substance.
The calcium-binding proteins were detected with immunohistochemistry as described below. Nissl substance was stained with
thionin to identify the parcellation of the thalamic nuclei.
I~~oh~toche~~t~.
An antiserum was raised in a rabbit
against calretinin purified from the guinea pig brain (52). Mouse
monoclonal antibodies against calbindinD28k purified from the
chicken gut (clone No. CL-300, lot No. 49F4826) and against
parvalbumin purified from the carp muscle (clone No. PA-235
lot No. 49F4824) were obtained commercially (Sigma Chemical
Co., St. Louis, MO).
Calcium-binding proteins were detected immunohistochemitally with a strep~vidin-peroxidase conjugate (47). The sections
were incubated as follows: a) 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h
at room temperature; b) 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at
room temperature; c) rabbit anticalretinin antiserum (diluted
1:5,000 in PBS), mouse anticalbindin-D28k antibody (125,000)
or mouse antiparvalbumin antibody (l:lO,OOO), each of which
contained 1% normal goat serum, for 48 h at 4°C; d) biotinylated
goat antirabbit immunoglobulin G (Vector, Burlingame, CA,
1:400 in PBS) for calretinin, or biotinylated goat antimouse immunoglobulin G (Vector, 1:2,000) for calbindin-D28k and parvalbumin, for 2 h at room temperature; e) streptavidin-peroxidase
(Kirkegaard & Perry Lab., Gaithersburg, MD, 1:2,000 in PBS)
for 2 h at room temperature. Tissue-bound peroxidase activity
was visualized by incubating sections with 0.025% 3, 3’-diamino-benzidine (Sigma), 0.6% nickel ammonium sulfate (Fisher,
Pittsburgh, PA) and 0.006% hydrogen peroxide in 0.05 M TrisHCl buffer t&H 7.6). After each incubation step, the sections were
rinsed in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.
In controls for the immunohistochemical staining, sections
were processed for the immunohist~hemis~y
described above
with omitting the three primary antibodies. No immunolabeling
was found under these conditions with any of the antibodies.

for 2 days in PBS containing 20% (w/v) sucrose (4°C). Serial
sections of the thalamus were cut on a cryostat in a frontal plane
at 2.5 pm and collected in PBS. Sets of four nei~bo~ng sections
were made at intervals of 100 pm in a rostrocaudal order, and
these sets were used for localization of the three calcium-binding

Procedure

For the three calcium-binding proteins, schematic drawings of
the localization of immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers were
made in the following manner. Of twelve sets of closely mached
four sections stained for calretinin, c~bindin-D28~ parvalbumin,
or Nissl substance, photographs were made with an Olympus light
microscope at X 60. Twelve sets of four montages of the sections
were made. Five representative levels were selected from the sets
of montages. By use of the montages of the sections stained for
calretinin, calbindin-D28k, or parvalbumin, the outline of the sections and immunoreactive cell bodies were first plotted onto translucent tracing papers (series 1,2 and 3, respectively), and then the
outline and i~unorea~ive
fi~r#ntai~ng
regions were plotted
onto different translucent tracing papers (series 4, 5, and 6, respectively). By use of the montages of the Nissl-stained sections,
the outline of the sections and the borders of brain regions were
plotted onto tracing papers (series 7). Six pairs of tracing papers
(series 1 and 7, 2 and 7, 3 and 7, 4 and 7, 5 and 7, 6 and 7) were
superimposed to make final schematic drawings (Figs. 4-8). The
localization and the packing density of both immunoreactive cell
bodies and fibers are summarized in Table 1. Packing density
was classified by a subjective estimation. To delineate the brain
regions, the literature (17,36) was consulted.

Specificityof PrimaryAntibodies
Anticalretininantibody. The possibility
has been suggested
that anticalretinin antiserum may crossreact with calbindin-D28k
because of a high degree of homology between calretinin and
~lbin~n-D~k
(42). In the case of the anti~lretinin
antiserum
used in the present study, however, this possibility is excluded
by the following data: a) we have previously done the preadsorption control using calretinin purified from the guinea pig
brain (23,52) and from the rat brain (3), and no immunohisto-

chemical staining has been found, b) the antiserum has detected
only calretinin but not calbindin-D28k
on a protein blot of the
guinea pig brain sample (.52), c) in a study with radioimmunoassay, the anticalretinin antiserum has reacted with calretinin purified from the rat brain, but no significant crossreactivity
has
been observed between the antiserum and purified rat c~bindinD28k (53). The antiserum has been widely used in immunohistochemical studies of the rat brain (2,3,16,19,23,31,52,54).
AnticalbindimD28kantibody.Immunoblots of the rabbit cerebellum sample, the anticalbindin-D28k
antibody used in the

600

present study, has been shown to crossreact with calbindin-D28k,
but not to crossreact with other calcium-binding proteins (11).
Preadsorption of the antibody with purified chicken intestinal calbindin-D28k has eliminated specific immunostaining of sections
of the rat brain (10). The antiserum has been widely used
rat brain
in immunohist~hemical
studies
of the
(9,10,16,18,26,40,45).
Antipawalbumin antibody. By radioimmunoassay and immunoblots, it has been shown that the antiparvalbumin antibody used in the present study crossreacts with rat parvalbumin, but does not crossreact with calmodulin, calbindinD28k, or another calcium-binding protein that is considered
to correspond to calretinin (12). The antiserum has been
widely used in immunohistochemical
studies of the rat
brain (10,13,15,26,29,39,45).

RESULTS

In the present study, we localized in detail the three calciumbinding proteins, calretinin, calbindin-D28k, and parvalbumin in
the rat thaiamus, and compared their distributions. Previous studies have d~rno~~ated i~unoreactivi~
to calretinin (23,43,54),
calbindin-D28k (6,10,18), and parvalbumin (10,15,18) in the rat
thalamus. The present findings are in general agreement with
these reports.

A detailed analysis of the localization of immunoreactive cell
bodies and fibers is summarized in Table 1. Figures 4-8 iliustrate

Cell bodies. The mediodorsal nucleus (MD) contained both
calretinin-stained

(Figs. 2B,E; 6B; 7B). The central part of the MD revealed no
neurons immunostained for any of the calcium-binding

of the MD contained neuropil that were preferentially stained for

3B; 5B; 6B; 7B; 8B), and the medial part of the VM also included
calretinin-stained
cells at its rostra1 and caudal levels (Figs. 1D;
3A, 5A; 8A). The ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) had a
cluster of faintly stained cells for calbindin-D28k
in its lateral
part at its caudal levels (Figs. 3B; 8B; 9E). The ventrolateral
nucleus (VL), ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) and gelatinosus nucleus (G) were almost devoid of cells immunostained
for any of the calcium-binding
proteins (Figs. lD-F; 2; 3; 5AC; 6A-C; 7A-C; 8A-C; 12A-C), though dispersed calbindinD28k-stained cells were found in the VL (Figs. 1E; 2B,E; 5B;
6B; 7B).
Fibers. Neuropil of the VL, VPL, VPM, and G showed predominantly parvalbumin immunoreactivity
(Figs. 1F; 2C,F; 3C;

the VPL showed neuropil densely stained for calretinin (Fig. 9A)
as well as parvalbumin (Fig. 9C).

nucleus (LP) at its caudal level showed both calretinin-stained
cells (Figs. 3A; 8A) and calbindin-D28k-stained
cells (Figs. 3B:

cells were
found throughout the nucleus (Figs. 2D; 7A; lOD), and calbindinD28k-stained cells were observed in its medial part (Figs. 3E:
7B; 10E).

Fibers. Neuropil of the LD at its intermediate levels showed
preferentially parvalbumin immunoreactivity
(Figs. 2C.F: 6~; 7c;

Posterior Nucleus
Cell bodies. Only calbindin-D28k-stained
cells were found in
the posterior nucleus (PO) (Figs. 2E; 3B; 7B; 8B).
Fibers. Neuropil of the PO revealed preferentially immunoreactivity of calbindin-D28k (Figs. 2E; 3B; 7b; 8b) and of parvalbumin (Figs. 2F; 3C; 7c; 8~).
Intralaminar Nuclear Group
Cell bodies. The central medial nucleus (CM) showed predominantly calretinin-stained
cells (Figs. 1D; 2A,D; 3A; SA; 6A;
7A; 8A; 11A; 12A), with a few calbindin-D28k-stained
cells included (Figs. 1E; 2B,E; 3B; 5B; 6B; 7B; 8B; 11B; 12B). The
centrolateral nucleus (CL) contained almost exclusively calbindin-D28k-stained
cells (Figs. 2B,E; 3B; 6B; 7B; 8B; 10E; llE),
though a few calretinin-labeled
cells were found in the dorsal
part at its caudal level (Figs. 3A; 8A). A cluster of calretininstained cells was found in the rostrodorsal part of the CL (Figs.
2A; 6A), and this cluster appeared to be an extension of the
calretinin-stained
cell group in the LP (Figs. 2D; 3A; 7A; 8A;
10D). The paracentral nucleus (PC) contained calbindin-D28kstained cells in its caudal part (Figs. 2B,E; 3B; 6B; 7B; 8B). This
cell group appeared to continue to the group of calbindin-D28kstained cells in the CL and in the lateral part of the MD (Figs.
2B,E; 3B; 6B; 7B; 8B). The lateral part of the PC contained
predominantly
calretinin-stained
cells at its rostra1 level (Figs.
1A; 4A). At the level of Fig. 5, a cluster of calretinin-stained
cells (Figs. 1D; SA; 11A) and only a few calbindin-D28k-stained
cells (Figs. 1E; 5B; 11B) were found in a region surrounded by
the PC, mediodorsal nucleus (MD), paratenial nucleus (PT) and/
or stria medularis of the thalamus (sm). No parvalbumin-stained
cells were found in this region (Figs. 1F; 5C; 11C). We named
this region the rostrodorsal cap (PCRDC) of the paracentral nucleus. The PCRDC appears to correspond to the region that has
been labeled the paracentral nucleus (PC) in Fig. 25 of Paxinos
and Watson (36); this term PC has also indicated the region in
the internal medullary lamina in the atlas of Paxinos and Watson

PVNA was found surrounded by the reuniens nucleus (Re). In
the dorsally placed PVNA, a larger number of calretinin-stained
cells were found in its lateral and ventral regions than in its central region (Figs. lA,D; 4A, 5A; 11A). The ventrally placed
PVNA included a few ~lretinin-stained cells (Figs. lA, 4A) and
a few calbindin-D28k-stained cells (Figs. lB, 4B). The parateniai
nucleus (PT) contained predominantly calbindin-D28k-stained
cells (Figs. lB,E, 4B; 5B; llB), and the dorsal part of the PT at
its rostra1 level also revealed calretinin-stained cells (Figs. 1A;
4A). The interanteromedial nucleus (IAM) contained exclusively
calbindin-labeled cells (Figs. 1E; 5B; 12B). The intermediodorsal
nucleus (IMD) showed both calretinin-stained cells (Figs. 2A,D;
3A; 6A, 7A, 8A) and c~bindin-DZ8k-ladled
cells (Figs. 2B,E;
3B; 6B, 7B, SB). In the reuniens nucleus (Re), calretinin-stained
cells (Figs. lA,D; 2A,D; 4A; 5A; 6A; 7A, 12D) and calbindinD28k-labeled cells (Figs. lB,E; 2B,E; 4B; SB; 6B; 7B; 12E) were
found with a similar distribution pattern. The rhomboid nucleus

(Rh) contained more calretinin-stained cells (Figs. 1D; 2A,D; 5A;
6A; 7A; 12A) than calbindin-D28k-labeled cells (Figs, 1E; 2B,E;

of cells stained for any of the calcium-binding proteins (Figs.

Fibers. The ventrally placed PVNA and the Xi were demarcated by the paucity of immunostained fibers for calretinin (Figs.

Reticxdar Nucleus
Ceil bodies. The reticular nucleus (Rt) was the only region of
the thalamus which showed predominantly parvalbumin-stained
cells. Parvalbumin-stained cells were found almost entirely in the
Rt (Figs. 1C,F; 2C,F; 3C; 4C; SG; 6C; 7C, 8C). Calretinin-stained
cells were found in the medial part of the Rt at its rostra1 level

(Figs. 1A; 4A) and in the dorsal part at its rostrai and inte~ediate

levels (Figs. lA,D; 2A; 4A; 5A; 6A). A differential distribution
pattern was found in the ventromedial corner of the Rt at its
rostra1 levels (Figs. 1; 4; 5). The dorsal portion of the ventromedial comer of the Rt contained both parvalbumin-stained cells
(Figs. lC,F; 4C; 5C; 13F) and ca~bindin-D~k-labeled
cells
(Figs. l&E; 4B; SB; f3E), and was devoid of caketinin-stained
cells (Figs. lA,D; 4A; SA; 13D). In the ventral portion of the

DISCUSSION
In this study, we showed that the regions of the rat thalamus were divided into three categories:
a) some regions revealed almost exclusively
cells containing
one of the calcium-binding
proteins,
b) other regions expressed
overlap
between the distributions
of two cell components
composed
of different calcium-binding
proteins, and c) other regions
showed no cells stained for any of the calcium-binding
proteins.

not crossreact with the other proteins: for example, a) the anticalretinin antibody did not crossreact with cells of the dorsal
portion of the ventromedial corner of the reticular nucleus, although these cells were immunostained by the anticalbindinD28k and antiparvalbumin antibodies, b) the anticalbindin-D28k

did not show crossreaction with cells of the medial and
dorsal parts of the reticular nucleus, whereas these cells were

reuniens nucleus, but these cells were revealed by the anticalretinin and anticalbindin-D28k antibodies.
ReZatiu~hip
Projections

With ~arn~~r Organization

of Thalamocortic~Z

The thalamic nuclei have been classified into four types according to their major cortical layers of projections (21,22). The

first type nuclei, which include the specific sensory relay nuclei,
predominantly project to the middle cortical layers (layers III and

IV). The second type nuclei mainly project to the deep cortical
layers (layers V and VI). The third type nuclei provide termination confined to a superficial cortical layer (layer I). The fourth
type is typified by their terminations both in layer I and in additional (middle and/or deep) layers. The second, third, and
fourth types include nonspecific nuclei. There is striking correspondence between this thalamic classification and the distribution pattern of thalamic cells immunoreactive to the calciumbinding proteins, as follows.
The second (central medial, centroiateral, paracentral, and
paraventricular nuclei) and third (ventromedial nucleus) type nuclei contained many calretinin- or ~~bind~“D28k-i~~noreactive cells. By contrast, the first type nuclei (ventral posterolateral,
ventral posteromedial, mediodorsal, and gelatinosus nuclei) included very few, if any, cells immunostained for any of the cal-

Of the fourth type nuclei, some nuclei

(anterodorsalt anteroventral, and ventrolateral nuclei) were almost devoid of the immunostained cells.
Deep layer projections (second type) could profoundly alter excitation of pyramidal neurons, by their terminations
on

the proximal dendrites of the pyramidal neurons (22). Superficial layer projections
(third type) might affect pyramidal
cells in a subtle and universal way, by their contacting
the
distal ends of apical dendrites of the pyramidal cells (21). On

It can be assumed, therefore, that calretinin and calbindinD28k could influence thalamocortical neurons projecting to the
deep and superficial cortical layers that could directly modulate
pyramidal ceil activity. A question of interest is whether calretinin and calbindin-D~k
may be contained in the thalam~ortical
neurons that project to the deep and superficial layers, or in local
neurons that contact the thalamocortical neurons.
New Thalamic Regions Revealed by Localization

of

The rostrodorsal cap of the paracentral nucleus (PCRDC) and
the ovoid subdivision of the paracentral nucleus (PCO) are outlined in the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (36), but their chemical
features have never been described. In the present study, these

regions were clearly demarcated by localization of the calciumbinding proteins. Previous studies have shown that the paracentral nucieus receives afferents from various regions including the
prefrontal cortex, cerebellar nuclei, and spinal cord, and mainly
projects to the prefrontal cortex and striatum [for references see
(7) and (30)]. Anterograde and retrograde tracing will be needed
to examine whether the PCRDC and PC0 have afferent and efferent connections with more restricted brain regions.
Subdivisions of the reticular nucleus was represented here by
the differential distribution of cells immunoreactive
to the calcium-binding proteins. It is believed that the reticular nucleus
may play a role in gating the relay of information through the
thalamus to the cerebral cortex (24). Recent studies have shown
that the reticular nucleus is not a uniform structure. For example,
in the rat reticular nucleus, several cytoarchitectonic
subdivisions
are described (49). Developmental

different regions of the reticular nucleus at different stages, and
these regions appear to correspond to the different sectors of the
nucleus which connect with different cortical and thalamic areas
(33). It is suggested, therefore, that the reticular nucleus may have
more localized and specific functions (32). The present finding
further provides evidence for heterogeneity of the reticular nucleus of the rat. It will be necessary to examine fiber connections
of the subdivisions of the reticular nucleus revealed by the present study.
Functional Considerations
Our understanding of the possible functions of the three calcium-binding proteins is still limited, therefore, the physiological
role of the proteins in neurons remains speculative. By virtue of
their Ca*+-buffering capacities, these calcium-binding proteins
potentially have a number of different effects on the neurons (4).
These effects could include: altering the duration of action potentials; promoting neuronal bursting activity; allowing for a
greater contribution of Ca2+ entry to the overall membrane depolarization; protecting cells against the damaging effects of excessive calcium influx during prolonged periods of high activity
(4). A strong correlation has been demonstrated between the occurrence of parvalbumin and the fast firing properties of the hippocampal interneurons (27). Dentate granule cells, depleted of
their calbindin-D28k content, had a lower whole-cell Ca” current than cells containing this protein, suggesting that loss of
calbindin-D28k from a neuron may reduce Ca*+ entry and contribute to making the neuron less excitable (28).

Complementarity was found between the distribution of calretinin-containing cells and that of calbindin-D28k-stained cells
in both the intralaminar nuclear group and midline nuclear group.
Taking into account high homology of amino acid sequence between calretinin and calbindin-D28k (35,50), this complementarity provides a clue for exploring the functions of these proteins
in neurons, such as an indication that the two calcium-binding
proteins may work synergistically in the regions where the complementarity is found.
Absence of cells stained for any of the three calcium-binding
proteins of the EF-hand family was found in some regions of the
anterior and ventral nuclear groups and of the mediodorsal nucleus. Most pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus do not contain calretinin, calbindin-D28k, or pa~albumin
(10,19,23,43,48,51), and it is suggested that calmodulin, another
member of the EF-hand family of calcium-binding proteins, may
be present in these neurons (4). Whether calmodulin is found in
cells of the thalamic regions that are free of immunostained cells
for calretinin, calbindin-D28k, and parvalbumin, and whether
complementarity exists between the distributions of calretinin-,
calbindin-D28k-, parvalbumin-, and calmodulin-containing cells
in the thalamic regions, will be the objects of future studies.
In conclusion, the present study presents a comparative distribution of the three calcium-binding proteins, calretinin, calbindin-D28k, and parvalbumin in the rat thalamus. These proteins
serve as useful neuroanatomical
markers
that focus on regions
that might be useful starting points for further exploration
of the
calcium-binding
proteins.

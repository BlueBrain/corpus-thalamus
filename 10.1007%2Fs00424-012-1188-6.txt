Abstract Mutations in genes coding for Ca2+ channels were
found in patients with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) indicating a contribution of Ca2+-dependent mechanisms to the
generation of spike-wave discharges (SWD) in humans. Since
the involvement of Ca2+ signals remains unclear, the aim of the
present study was to elucidate the function of a Ca2+-dependent
K+ channel (BKCa) under physiological conditions and in the
pathophysiological state of CAE. The activation of BKCa channels is dependent on both voltage and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Moreover, these channels exhibit an outstandingly
high level of regulatory heterogeneity that builds the basis for
the influence of BKCa channels on different aspects of neuronal
activity. Here, we analyse the contribution of BKCa channels to
firing of thalamocortical relay neurons, and we test the

hypothesis that BKCa channel activity affects the phenotype
of a genetic rat model of CAE. We found that the activation of
the β2-adrenergic receptor/protein kinase A pathway resulted in
BKCa channel inhibition. Furthermore, BKCa channels affect
the number of action potentials fired in a burst and produced
spike frequency adaptation during tonic activity. The latter
result was confirmed by a computer modelling approach. We
demonstrate that the β2-adrenergic inhibition of BKCa channels
prevents spike frequency adaptation and, thus, might significantly support the tonic firing mode of thalamocortical relay
neurons. In addition, we show that BKCa channel functioning
differs in epileptic WAG/Rij and thereby likely contributes to
highly synchronised, epileptic network activity.

Introduction
Depending on the state of vigilance, thalamocortical relay
(TC) neurons of the mammalian brain operate in two different
firing modes. Rhythmic oscillations dominate the TC network
during states of slow-wave sleep as well as absence epilepsy
[14, 52]. On the cellular level, this state of network activity is
characterised by burst-like action potential (AP) discharges
and a relative unresponsiveness of TC neurons to peripheral
inputs. On the other hand, tonic firing of single APs prevails
during wakefulness. In this state, incoming sensory stimuli
from the periphery are faithfully transferred to cortical regions
for further processing [53]. The switch between burst and
tonic firing is partially governed by noradrenaline, released
from neurons residing in the locus coeruleus [34]. Prominent
targets of the β-adrenergic/cyclic AMP/protein kinase A

470

(PKA) pathway are the pacemaker current Ih [41], the L-type
Ca2+ current [40], and the Ca2+-activated K+ current (IKCa) [1].
These currents (among others) influence and shape the abovementioned firing patterns. Former characterisation of wholecell currents and computer models indicated that IKCa, which
has the characteristics of a current through BKCa channels,
contributes to tonic firing of TC neurons [1, 9, 26, 35].
However, the exact role of BKCa channels in the generation
of TC activity patterns remains elusive. BKCa channels (also
known as maxi-K+, KCa1.1, Slo1) are expressed in various
regions of the brain. Based on their K+ conductance in the
range of 200 to 250 pS in symmetrical 150 mM K+, they can
be distinguished from the closely related small conductance
(SK; 5–20 pS) and intermediate conductance (IK; 20–40 pS)
K+ channels [18]. These channels are regulated by phosphorylation through diverse kinases, e.g. PKA [47, 58]. Functional
BKCa channels are comprised of four pore-forming α-subunits
encoded by a single gene (Slo1, KCNMA1). Nevertheless,
native BKCa channels exhibit a broad variety of functional
properties in different cell types [19, 20] or during altered
physiological conditions [29] and undergo developmental modifications [32]. This functional diversity is caused by extensive
alternative splicing of the KCNMA1 pre-mRNA [57]. ZERO
and STREX represent two splice variants which reveal specific
PKA consensus sequence patterns that determine activation or
inhibition by phosphorylation [54]. Their sensitivity to increased intracellular Ca2+ levels, cyclic AMP-induced phosphorylation, as well as depolarised membrane potentials makes
these variants unique in that they can integrate three independent signals to promote an adequate neuronal response. This
high level of regulatory heterogeneity builds the basis for the
influence of BKCa channels on different aspects of neuronal
activity, like firing frequency, AP width as well as early and late
phases of frequency adaptation in different cell types [21, 48].
In the context of childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), missense mutations in genes coding for Ca2+ channels were found
in genetic animal models and in CAE patients, indicating a
contribution of Ca2+-dependent mechanisms to the pathophysiology of this disorder [5, 6, 12]. Moreover, the effect of a highly
effective drug in the treatment of absence epilepsy (ethosuximide, ETX [43]) was ascribed to the combined action on three
types of ion channels, including BKCa [6]. The aim of our study
was to elucidate the function of BKCa channels under physiological conditions and in the pathophysiological state of CAE.
Therefore, we compared data from the epileptic WAG/Rij strain
to results derived from its corresponding control strain August–
Copenhagen Irish (ACI) [16, 27]. Animals of the ACI strain
have been frequently used as controls to compare molecular and
cellular properties of thalamic neurons in epileptic vs. nonepileptic rats [4–6, 8, 28]. By making use of electrophysiological, molecular biological, immunohistochemical and computer
modelling approaches, we analysed the β2-adrenergic receptormediated modulation of BKCa channels and the firing behaviour

Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol (2013) 465:469–480

of TC neurons of a non-epileptic rat strain, ACI, and we tested
the hypothesis that the Ca2+-activated and cAMP-modulated
BKCa channels contribute to the occurrence of the CAE pathophysiology in the genetic rat model WAG/Rij [13].

Materials and methods
Tissue preparation
All animal work has been approved by local authorities (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz NordrheinWestfalen; approval ID: 8.87-51.05.20.10.117 and 8751.04.2010.A322). For electrophysiological recordings, thalamic slices were prepared as described earlier [38] from WAG/Rij
or ACI rats at an age ranging from postnatal day (P)14 to P25.
Patch clamp recordings
Whole-cell recordings were performed on visually identified
TC neurons of the dorsal part of the lateral geniculate
nucleus (dLGN) in acute brain slices at room temperature
(~23 °C), using glass microelectrodes pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (GC150TF-10, Harvard Apparatus)
that were connected to an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik). Typical electrode resistance was 2–4 MΩ, while
access resistance was 5–15 MΩ. Experiments were controlled by Pulse software (HEKA Elektronik). For voltageclamp recordings of the Ca2+-activated K+ current, the following solutions were used (in mM): NaCl, 140; KCl, 2;
HEPES, 10; glucose, 10; MgCl2, 3; CaCl2, 1; TTX, 5 10−4;
pH 7.35 with NaOH. The drug ZD7288 (30 μM) was
routinely added to the perfusion medium to block Ih currents. The K-gluconate-based internal solution contained (in
mM) NaCl, 10; K-gluconate, 95; K3-citrate, 20; HEPES, 10;
MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 0.1; EGTA, 1.1; phosphocreatine, 15; MgATP, 3; Na2-GTP, 0.5; QX-314-Cl, 3.35; pH 7.25 with
KOH. For current-clamp measurements, the bath medium
was artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) which contained
(in mM) NaCl, 120; KCl, 2.5; NaH2PO4, 1.25; NaHCO3,
22; MgSO4, 2; CaCl2, 2; glucose, 20; pH 7.35 with 95 %
O2–5 % CO2. The intracellular solution in these experiments
contained (in mM) K-gluconate, 88; NaCl, 10; K3-citrate,
20; HEPES, 10; BAPTA, 3; phosphocreatine, 15; MgCl2, 1;
CaCl2, 0.5; Mg-ATP, 3; Na2-GTP, 0.5; pH 7.25 with KOH.
Drugs were purchased from Biotrend (paxilline, iberiotoxin,
okadaic acid), from Sigma Aldrich (gramicidine) or from
Tocris Bioscience (salmeterol, charybdotoxin, xamoterol
hemifumarate, ZD7288). An equimolar concentration of
ascorbic acid was routinely added to salmeterol-containing
solutions as an antioxidant. For perforated patch clamp, after
getting the GΩ-seal with gramicidine (5 nM) in the internal
solution, it took 5–20 min until the access to the cell was

visible on the oscilloscope by sudden appearance of capacitance transients.
All values are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance of data with Gaussian distribution was evaluated by
Student’s t test, while non-parametric data were tested using
the Mann–Whitney test. Values of p<0.05 were considered
statistically significant. For current-clamp data, custom written
MatLab routines were used to analyse AP characteristics during burst and tonic firing. Mean values for the number of APs,
for interspike intervals (ISI) as well as the adaptation index (AI)
were calculated in every depolarising pulse. The time between
the release from the hyperpolarisation step and the peak of the
first AP crowning the low-threshold burst was taken as time-topeak (TTP). The adaptation index is defined as follows:

AI ¼

ð1Þ

For the analysis of voltage-clamp recordings, values for
the peak amplitude, the inactivation ratio (IR) and the TTP
for the current induced by the voltage step to +60 mV were
calculated. OriginPro8G software (OriginLab) was used for
data analysis and figure plotting.
Immunohistochemistry in brain slices
Rats were deeply anaesthetised using pentobarbital (50 mg/kg
body weight) and transcardially perfused with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), followed by ice-cold 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA)/PBS for 35–40 min. Brains were removed,
postfixed for 12 h in 4 % PFA/PBS and cryoprotected with
30 % sucrose. Coronal sections (40 μm) were cut at the level
of the dLGN. After several washing steps, free-floating sections were blocked with 10 % normal horse serum (NHS), 2 %
bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.05 % Triton X-100 in
Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 2 h. Slices were co-stained with
goat anti-KCNMA1 (anti-BKCa) (1:100, Abnova) and rabbit
anti-β2 adrenoceptor (1:300, Alomone Labs) at 4 °C for 16–
18 h and after washing steps thereafter with Cy3-conjugated
donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:300, Dianova) and Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:400, Invitrogen) for
1.5 h in 2 % NHS, 2 % BSA and 0.05 % Triton X-100 in TBS.
As negative controls, occlusion of the primary antibody from
the staining procedure was routinely performed, and no positive immunological signal was detected (not shown). All
images were obtained using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon eC1 plus).
Polymerase chain reaction
RNA was prepared from freshly dissected tissue by extraction
with Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s

instructions (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen). First-strand cDNA
was primed with oligo(dT) from 2.5 μg of mRNA and synthesised using the RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Fermentas Life Sciences). PCR was performed in a 25-μl
reaction mixture using 1 U HotStarTaq polymerase (Qiagen)
for amplification of BKCa templates; in all cases, the mixture
contained 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP and 50 pmol
of each primer. Primer sequences were the following: for both
STREX and ZERO amplificates, 5′-AGTGCCTTCG
TGGGCTGTCCTTC-3′ and 5′-CACATTGGAGTCCATGT
TGT-3′ [32] (annealing temperature Tann 055 °C), ZERO: 5′G C C A A A G A A G T TA A A A G G G C AT T- 3 ′ a n d 5 ′ CGGCTGCTCATCTTCAAGC-3′ and STREX: 5′-TTTGA
TTGCGGACGTTCTGA-3′ and 5′-TCTCTCAAGGGTG
TCCACGTTAC-3′ [33] (both Tann 060 °C). Cycling protocols
were as follows: 15 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles (30 s at 95 °C, 30 s
at Tann, 1 min at 72 °C); 7 min at 72 °C final elongation; ∞4 °C.
A template-free water control was included in every run. PCR
products were visualised by electrophoresis in 2 % agarose gel.
Computer simulations
All simulations were processed within the NEURON Simulation Environment [24] and are based on a temperature of 23
and 36 °C, respectively. Length and diameter of the single
compartment model were 96 μm each, thereby resulting in a
total area of about 29,000 μm2. The model included IKCa (also
termed IC) [25], IL [25], Hodgkin–Huxley sodium and potassium currents [17], a non-selective, passive leak current [24],
as well as a calcium pump [17]. Besides the passive membrane channel, which is part of the NEURON Simulation
Environment, all current implementations were gained from
the SenseLabModelDB (accession numbers 3808 and 3343).
Ion concentrations were set to (extra-/intracellular, in mM)
Na+ 0143/10, K+ 02.5/148 and Ca2+ 02/0.5.

Results
Cyclic AMP-dependent modulation of BKCa channels
affects tonic AP firing in TC neurons
We investigated TC neurons in dLGN, representing a prototype of thalamocortical neurons that is involved in both sensory signal transmission and rhythmic-synchronised activity
during spike-wave discharges (SWD) [22, 51]. To assess the
modulation of the tonic firing mode in TC neurons by β2adrenergic stimulation, we performed current-clamp recordings in the presence of the Ih blocker ZD7288 (30 μM). Under
these conditions, TC neurons of ACI rats revealed stable
resting membrane potentials (−80.2±0.8 mV, n049). To allow
tonic firing, cells were depolarised to −57.3±1.4 mV (n049)
by using constant DC current injection. Tonic firing was

472

elicited by injection of short (800 ms) depolarising DC current
pulses (100 to 200 pA) every 30 s. Under control conditions in
ACSF (Fig. 1a), TC neurons generated trains of APs that
showed slight frequency adaptation (AI01.3±0.02) with an
increased ISI (p<0.01) after 30 and 50 min (Fig. 1a, g; for
absolute AP numbers and ISI, see Supplementary Table 1).
This effect was accompanied by a significant (p<0.01) decrease in the number of APs (n05, Fig. 1a, h). The amplitude
of the constant DC current injection was not changed throughout the experiment. No changes in membrane potential occurred within the 50-min recording period, indicating overall
stable cell viability and recording conditions (Supplementary
Fig. 1). We activated the endogenous canonical cyclic AMP
producing pathway, involving β2-adrenergic receptors, Gαs
proteins, adenylyl cyclases and PKA, by applying the β2adrenergic agonist salmeterol [37]. When this cascade was
activated by salmeterol (10 μM) after an initial control period
of 10 min, the increase in ISI and the decrease in the number of
APs after a recording period of 30 min were no longer significant (n08; Fig. 1b, g, h). Following wash out of salmeterol, the
ISI and the number of APs after a recording time of 50 min
approached the values seen under control conditions. Next, TC
neurons from WAG/Rij were analysed under current-clamp
conditions (resting membrane potential −81.1±1.5 mV; n09;
data not shown). Following DC depolarisation to −58.3±
0.1 mV, depolarising current pulses induced tonic AP firing
with only moderate spike frequency adaptation (AI01.4±0.1).
As for ACI, application of salmeterol in WAG/Rij prevented
the long-term changes in ISI and the number of APs. Since the
effect of salmeterol in WAG/Rij was not significantly different
in comparison to ACI, the following experiments were solely
performed in ACI rats. As Ca2+-activated K+ currents possess
the ability to induce spike frequency adaptation [21], we applied the BKCa-specific blocker iberiotoxin (100 nM; Fig. 1c).
In these experiments, neither significant changes in ISI nor in
the numbers of APs were observed (n018; Fig. 1g, h). Coapplication of iberiotoxin and salmeterol did not induce any
further effect on ISI or the number of APs (n09; Fig. 1d, g, h).
For comparison, the potent and specific BKCa channel blockers
charybdotoxin (ChTx; 200 nM) and paxilline (Pax; 10 μM)
were used in combination, since paxilline strongly enhances the
binding of ChTx to BKCa channels [44]. The combined application of ChTx and paxilline exerted the strongest suppression
of spike frequency adaptation with increasing numbers of APs
and reduced ISIs (n09; Fig. 1e, g, h). Inhibition of endogenous
kinase activity is able to increase BKCa channel activity approximately threefold [23]. Therefore, we tested tonic firing
with a phosphatase inhibitor (okadaic acid, 10 nM; n05) in the
internal solution (Fig. 1f–h). Within about 30 min, okadaic acid
led to a hyperpolarisation of the membrane and associated
dampening of spike firing (Fig. 1f, middle trace). For better
comparison of tonic firing under phosphatase inhibition with
the other recording conditions, the membrane potential was

Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol (2013) 465:469–480

reset to the initial level and action potential trains were analysed. Since more APs were fired and ISIs were decreased
compared to control, spike frequency adaptation could not be
detected (Fig. 1f, right trace). This indicates that the increased
phosphorylation leads to BKCa channel inhibition. Since we
have recently detected expression of β1-adrenergic receptors in
TC neurons [42], we tested the effect of the β1-specific agonist
(10 μM xamoterol hemifumarate) on tonic firing of dLGN
neurons. Although β1-adrenergic receptors activate cAMP/
PKA signalling similar to β2-adrenergic receptors [45], xamoterol application did not induce alterations in tonic firing behaviour (n07, see Supplementary Table 1). As control,
recordings in perforated patch mode with and without phosphatase inhibitors in the pipette solution were performed, and
the results were found to be similar to those gained in the
whole-cell mode (see Supplementary Table 1). Moreover, calculation of the ChTx/Pax-sensitive IKCa fraction of the total
outward current revealed stable current amplitudes after 50 min
of whole-cell recordings, indicating constant recording conditions (Supplementary Fig. 2). In sum, these findings indicate a
BKCa channel-dependent spike frequency adaptation in TC
neurons from ACI and WAG/Rij rats which is prevented by
phosphatase inhibition and β2-receptor stimulation.
Analysis of IKCa-mediated effects on burst firing behaviour
in TC neurons
To analyse the influence of IKCa on the burst firing mode of TC
neurons, we performed whole-cell current-clamp recordings in
acute brain slices. Injection of negative current pulses (100 to
150 pA, 2 s duration) induced a hyperpolarisation of the membrane potential to approximately −100 mV (Fig. 2a, b). Following the release from hyperpolarisation, a low-threshold
spike (LTS) crowned by a burst of APs was elicited. Recordings
of burst activity for up to 1 h (data not shown) revealed no
change in the number of LTS-crowning action potentials in
both strains over time. In another set of recordings, the selective
BKCa channel blocker combination ChTx/Pax was applied.
Under control conditions, the number of APs averaged 1.5±
0.2 (n08) and 1.6±0.2 (n06) in ACI and WAG/Rij, respectively (p00.73). Application of the BKCa channel blockers
significantly raised the number of APs crowing the LTS in
ACI dLGN neurons (n06, p00.01), while there was no change
in recordings from WAG/Rij neurons (n06, p00.48). In both
strains, time-to-peak showed only a nominal increase (Fig. 2c,
for absolute TTP values see Supplementary Table 2). The
ChTx/Pax-sensitive currents were found to be similar in ACI
and WAG/Rij (Figs. 2d and 4b(a)).
Detection of BKCa channel transcripts and proteins in dLGN
In the following, immunohistochemical staining and PCR
analysis were combined in order to determine the cellular

Fig. 1 Blockade of BKCa channels inhibits time-dependent spike
frequency adaptation in thalamic neurons. a–f Example traces recorded
from ACI neurons. Firing patterns were induced by 800 ms depolarising pulses (100–200 pA) from a potential set to about −60 mV by DC
current injection. External solution was either artificial cerebrospinal
fluid (ACSF, a) or ACSF with either salmeterol (b), iberiotoxin (a
specific BKCa channel blocker, c), a combination of salmeterol and
iberiotoxin (d) or the BKCa blockers charybdotoxin and paxilline (e).
Traces in b–e show firing patterns under control conditions (10 min),
drug application (30 min) and wash out (50 min). Since okadaic acid
had to be added to the internal solution (f), phosphatases were inhibited
during the whole recording period. After 50 min of okadaic acid

recordings, the holding potential was reset to the initial value (as
indicated), since application of the phosphatase inhibitor induced a
hyperpolarisation of the membrane potential. Calibration bars indicated in a account for all traces. g Bar graph of normalised interspike

localisation and expression of splice variants of BKCa channels in the thalamus. The use of a specific antibody revealed
positive staining for BKCa channels in all neuronal somata
(Fig. 3a). A standard PCR approach demonstrated the presence of the stress-regulated exon splice variant of BKCa
channels, termed STREX, as well as the insert less variant,
ZERO, in dLGN, the ventrobasal complex of the thalamus
(VB), and the hippocampus (HC; Fig. 3b). The detection of
the STREX variant points to the possibility of a blockade of
BKCa channels after phosphorylation via PKA in dLGN TC
neurons.

Cyclic AMP-dependent modulation of BKCa channelmediated currents in TC neurons
Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed in acute
brain slices, and modulation of IKCa via the β2-adrenergic
pathway and specific blockers was tested by monitoring the
total K+ outward current in dLGN TC neurons. K+ currents
were evoked by a voltage protocol starting from a
holding potential of −70 mV, followed by a hyperpolarisation to −110 mV (1 s), a conditioning pulse to −40 mV
(100 ms) and depolarising voltage steps varying bet-

TC neurons of non-epileptic rats. a, b Example traces showing burst
firing before (a) and during ChTx/Pax application (b). Thalamocortical
relay neurons of ACI (a) and WAG/Rij (b) were held at about −60 mV
and step-hyperpolarised to ~−100 mV. After the release from hyperpolarisation, these cells showed burst firing. Calibration bars are valid
for all traces. The inset shows the current-clamp stimulation protocol
underlying the depicted traces. c In cells of non-epileptic ACI (black

bars), application of the selective BKCa blocker cocktail (200 nM
ChTx+10 μM Pax) induced a significant increase in the number of
LTS associated APs (left), while no significant changes were detected
in recordings from WAG/Rij neurons (white bars). Time-to-peak values (TTP, right) showed nominal increase in both strains. d Charybdotoxin/paxilline (ChTx/Pax)-sensitive portions of the total K+-current in
TC neurons from non-epileptic ACI and the epileptic WAG/Rij rats

ween −60 and +90 mV (2 s, 30 mV increments, Fig. 4d).
Due to the conditioning pulse, the fast, transient A-current
was inactivated and the currents evoked by the depolarising
voltage steps revealed medium fast activation and slow,
incomplete inactivation. It has been shown before that a
fraction of this current is sensitive to the removal of extracellular Ca2+, is inhibited by activation of adenylyl cyclases
and is mediated by BKCa channels [1, 9]. Application of
salmeterol significantly (p<0.05) reduced current amplitudes in non-epileptic and epileptic animals (ACI −16.1±
3.4 %, n05; WAG/Rij −12.5±3.2 %, n08), but no differences for the inactivation ratios and TTP in both rat strains
were found (Fig. 4a(a, b), data and traces from ACI rats, for
absolute values see Supplementary Table 3). Next, the
blocker combination ChTx/Pax was tested. In both rat
strains, a significant (p<0.005) reduction of K+ currents
was found (ACI −15.7±2.8 %, n05; WAG/Rij −12±2 %,
n06), while there were no significant effects on inactivation
ratios and TTP (Fig. 4b(a, b), data and traces from ACI rats).
Since the results for ACI and WAG/Rij rats were found
indistinguishable, the following analysis was performed
solely on ACI rats. Activation of the β2-adrenergic receptor

in the presence of the blocker cocktail (Fig. 4c(a)) did not
result in further current inhibition (−16.2±3.8 %; n07, p<
0.01, Fig. 4c(b)). Again for the IR as well as TTP, no
significant differences could be detected between control
conditions and in the presence of salmeterol and ChTx/
Pax. These findings indicate a β2-adrenergic receptordependent inhibition of BKCa channels in dLGN relay neurons of non-epileptic ACI as well as the epileptic WAG/Rij
rats.
Single-compartment modelling confirms BKCa channeldependent spike frequency adaptation during tonic firing
Next, the contribution of BKCa channels to the characteristics of the tonic firing mode was evaluated in silico by a
single-compartment TC neuron model which has been described earlier [56]. The model’s resting membrane potential
was adjusted to −60 mV. While tonic firing was elicited by
the application of depolarising pulses (200 pA, 800 ms) in
the current-clamp mode, the intracellular Ca2+ dynamic and
temperature-dependent AP generation was monitored in the
presence (Fig. 5a, b(a)) and absence (Fig. 5a, b(b)) of IKCa.

the depolarising pulse revealed that BKCa channels led to
increasing ISIs and thus influenced the model’s overall firing
pattern. Tonic AP firing was associated with a slow and
stepwise increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, with
each step being correlated to one of the APs (Fig. 5a(a, b)).
Removing IKCa from the model cell totally abolished spike
frequency adaptation. The ISIs were constant throughout the
whole pulse, while the intracellular Ca2+ level increased faster
and reached higher amplitudes (Fig. 5a(b)). Since all in vitro
experiments were performed at room temperature (~23 °C),
the computer modelling approach was used to evaluate the
temperature influence on the TC cell’s tonic firing mode
(Fig. 5b). When the simulation temperature was elevated to
body temperature (36 °C), ISIs were increased with an AI of
1.2 and 1.5 at 23 and 36 °C, respectively (Fig. 5b(a)). Removal of IKCa from the computer model completely abolished
spike frequency adaptation (Fig. 5b(b)) and thus confirmed
the in vitro results.
Endogenous protein phosphatases were shown to slowly
disinhibit and thus gradually increase the activity of heterologously expressed BKCa channels [23]. In the present study,
brain slice recordings pointed to the possibility that BKCa
channels get progressively activated during long-lasting patch
clamp recordings. In long-term recordings, we found that the
IKCa fraction of the total outward current after 50 min is larger
than 10 min after establishment of the whole-cell configuration (Supplementary Fig. 2). Therefore, the TC cell model was
used to assess the influence of increasing BKCa channel

availability on the tonic firing mode (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Starting at 0 %, the IKCA amplitude was successively increased in 10 % steps and the corresponding spike frequency
adaptation was calculated. The resulting graph shows an almost linear relationship between AI and IKCa that finally
converges to a constant plateau. Example traces (Supplementary Fig. 3Aa, b) of recordings with 80 % and 120 % of IKCa
show that the increasing BKCa conductance reduces the generated number of APs (depolarising pulse as before) and, thus,
perfectly mimics the alterations of tonic firing found in our in
vitro experiments. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the K+ current through BKCa channels is able to
shape the tonic firing pattern of TC neurons.

Discussion
The present study was undertaken to assess the contribution of
BKCa channels to the firing modes of TC neurons in control
and epileptic rats. Therefore, we investigated well-established
lines (WAG/Rij vs. ACI) of epileptic and non-epileptic rats
[13, 15, 16, 27] and chose a prototypical sensory thalamic
nucleus (dLGN) contributing to SWD activity [22, 49, 51].
Since critical pathophysiological mechanisms have been identified at juvenile age in these rats, before SWDs are apparent
on the electroencephalogram [3, 8, 28, 30, 46], we investigated animals in this developmental stage. The results can be
summarised as follows: (1) In both strains, analysis of tonic
firing revealed a slow and time-dependent increase of spike

frequency adaptation and a decrease in the number of APs per
spike train. This effect was abolished by β2-adrenergic
activation, phosphatase inhibition and direct blocking of
BKCa channels. (2) Analysis of burst firing at hyperpolarised levels of the membrane potential showed that blockade of BKCa channels led to an increase in the number of
APs crowning the LTS in neurons of non-epileptic rats,
while burst firing behaviour of cells from absence epilepsy rats
(WAG/Rij) remained unchanged. (3) The phosphorylationregulated splice variations of BKCa channels—STREX and
ZERO—are expressed in ACI dLGN neurons. (4) β2-adrenergic stimulation-dependent inhibition of BKCa channels appears
to be complete, since the extent of current reduction was similar
with a specific channel blocker combination. (5) Single-cell

computer modelling confirmed an IKCa-induced spike frequency adaptation in TC neurons.
It is concluded that current through BKCa channels contributes to both major firing modes of dLGN TC neurons.
This is the first time that β2-adrenergic stimulation was
shown to suppress BKCa channel activation in these
neurons. Beyond the cellular level, this effect might be
of relevance during the behavioural state of wakefulness, since it should promote the faithful transfer of
sensory information. However, during the pathophysiological state of epilepsy, BKCa channels seemingly contribute to alterations of burst firing that might support
the oscillatory, highly synchronised activity of neuronal
networks.

Fig. 5 Reducing IKCa affects tonic firing in silico. The single TC
neuron model was set to rest at a potential of −60 mV and tonic firing
was analysed by applying 800 ms lasting depolarising pulses in
current-clamp mode (stimulation protocol indicated in a(a) and b(a)).

doubled in a, while the ISIs remain stable in b. Ca2+ peaks coincide
with APs while the intracellular Ca2+ concentration slowly rises during

the depolarising pulse and finally reaches a plateau. Probably due to
the increased firing rate in b, the maximal Ca2+ concentration is higher.

Note in a that the in vitro condition at room temperature (solid line)
even dampens the spike frequency adaptation as the adaptation index

23 °C (AI01.2). Exclusion of IKCa still abolishes any spike frequency
adaptation. Calibration bars are valid for a and b

The contribution of BKCa channels to burst firing patterns
of TC neurons

no alterations in WAG/Rij cells. TTP values were only
slightly increased in both strains. Moreover, we found a
nominally smaller blocker-sensitive current in WAG/Rij
neurons (see Fig. 2). It is well known that different membrane currents contribute to LTS generation, among them
the low-threshold Ca2+ current (IT) and the pacemaker current Ih. For both membrane currents, altered electrophysiological properties have been found in TC neurons from ACI
compared to WAG/Rij rats [5, 28]. These alterations seem to
stabilise LTS generation in TC neurons from WAG/Rij rats
in a way that block of BKCa channels did not change LTS
generation of epileptic rats in the present study. We therefore
thought it legitimate to propose that a lack of IKCa will
influence the delicate interplay of ionic currents leading to
diverging firing patterns in ACI and WAG/Rij neurons.
Although long-term recordings revealed no differences between the strains, these findings suggest that TC neurons of
epileptic WAG/Rij rats might possess BKCa channels with
different pharmacological profiles (i.e. splice variants)

Upon depolarisation from potential levels negative to
−65 mV, thalamic neurons fire AP bursts on top of a LTS,
both under in vivo and in vitro conditions. It is well known
that this burst firing behaviour dominates the TC network
during physiological as well as pathophysiological behavioural states, i.e. slow-wave sleep, deep anaesthesia and
absence epileptic seizures. It is also known that βadrenergic signalling suppresses rhythmic burst firing and
induces tonic firing in TC neurons by the modulation of
hyperpolarisation-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation
(HCN) channels [36, 41].
Long-term recordings revealed no difference between the
rat strains in the number of action potentials per burst.
However, specific blockade of the current through BKCa
channels led to a significant increase in the number of
LTS-associated APs in ACI TC neurons, while there were

478

compared to the control group. However, studies concerning
the quantitative expression of BKCa channel variants in
different rodent strains are still missing. Previous studies
have shown that the classical anti-absence drug ETX
blocks—besides other ion channels—BKCa channels [6,
31]. Indeed, application of this drug induced a modulation
of thalamic burst activity in terms of a delayed LTS onset as
well as an increase in the number of LTS-associated APs [6].
In this previous work, we have shown that the block of IT
induced the delayed onset, whereas a reduction in IKCa was
proposed to have caused the higher number of APs crowning the LTS. This conclusion is verified by the use of highly
specific BKCa channel blockers in the present study. On the
level of neuronal networks, these BKCa-mediated alterations
of burst firing might—like ETX application does—support
the suppression of oscillatory, highly synchronised activity.
The contribution of BKCa channels to tonic firing of dLGN
TC neurons
Here, we show that IKCa in dLGN TC neurons is modulated by
the cyclic AMP/PKA signalling pathway. In addition, STREX
mRNA is expressed in the rodent thalamus at all postnatal
ages [32] and was detected in dLGN in the present study (see
Fig. 3). Inhibition of BKCa channels requires the phosphorylation of only one α-subunit at a STREX-specific PKA consensus site [11, 32, 54], and previous data from our lab
revealed a cyclic AMP-mediated inhibition of BKCa channels
in TC neurons of the VB [1]. The STREX variant is labelled
by a 174-bp insertion into the C-terminus of the pore-forming
subunit that comprises an additional PKA consensus sequence
[55]. Furthermore, distinct stoichiometry of BKCa channel
tetramer phosphorylation specifies channel activation or inhibition. Phosphorylation of serine 899 (S899) by PKA in all
four α-subunits of the BKCa channel is required to increase
channel activity, but PKA phosphorylation within the
STREX-insert of a single α-subunit is sufficient for channel
inhibition [11, 32, 54]. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that
channel phosphorylation leads to current reduction in dLGN
TC neurons. What are the functional consequences of this
current decrease for the tonic firing behaviour? During the
time course of the whole-cell current-clamp experiments presented here, spike frequency adaptation occurred at recording
times exceeding 15–20 min while applying repeated depolarising current steps. This build-up of adaptation was sensitive
to application of selective BKCa channel blockers (IbTx;
ChTx/Pax), blockade of intracellular phosphatases and pharmacological β2-adrenergic (not β1-adrenergic) receptor stimulation. The results were confirmed in perforated patch
recordings, suggesting a physiological mechanism, rather than
a matter of cell viability. Inhibition of endogenous phosphatases even induces a stronger effect than the activation of the
cAMP/PKA pathway after salmeterol application. This is

Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol (2013) 465:469–480

most probably due to the fact that phosphorylation-induced
inhibition of BKCa channel activity cannot only be ascribed to
PKA, but also to protein kinase C activity [50]. In sum, these
findings suggest that there is a highly regulated kinase–
phosphatase balance and that basal and/or stimulus-induced
activity of endogenous protein phosphatases causes a slow
increase in BKCa channel availability (see Fig. 1a and
Supplementary Fig. 2 [23]), so that spike frequency adaptation
appears. In silico, a simulation of a slowly increasing IKCa
induced spike frequency adaptation in TC neurons (see
Supplementary Fig. 3). Dephosphorylation of PKA consensus
sites on STREX-containing BKCa channels is a possible basis
for this change in channel function [23, 54]. Stimulation of
BKCa channel phosphorylation by salmeterol may abolish this
phenomenon during the recordings presented here.
Besides BKCa channels, HVA Ca2+ channels which are
thought to contribute to tonic firing in TC neurons are
sensitive to cAMP-dependent modulation [40, 42]. Furthermore, a member of the two pore domain (K2P) channel
family, termed TREK-1, is known to be inhibited by cyclic
AMP and expressed in TC neurons [2, 39]. Indeed, a cyclic
AMP-inhibited leak conductance has been described in TC
neurons of rat dLGN [7]. Therefore, several ion channels are
expected to contribute to the cyclic AMP-dependent modulation of the tonic firing mode of thalamic neurons.
Within a train of APs, BKCa channels only became activated at late phases of the depolarising pulse, when intracellular Ca 2+ levels had slowly built up [10], thereby
allowing the voltage-induced channel activation. This conclusion is confirmed by the finding that BKCa channel
blockers had no effect on the ISIs of the first few APs (data
not shown). This scenario is supported by addressing the
functional significance of BKCa channel activation for tonic
AP firing in computer simulations. During long depolarising
current steps, intermittent AP firing, a deviation from regular tonic firing, was previously modelled by the interaction
of inward Ca2+ currents and a Ca2+-activated K+ current
(resembling current through BKCa channels) via an intracellular increase of Ca2+ [56]. When BKCa channels were
removed from the computer model, only full tonic firing
without any intermittence was obtained thereby corroborating the results presented here. As ion channel kinetics and
intracellular Ca2+ dynamics are known to be temperature
dependent, we additionally used this approach to verify that
the results obtained from slice experiments at room temperature were comparable to the results obtained at body
temperature.
BKCa channels as a fine adjustment mechanism
of thalamocortical activity
The findings of the present study demonstrate that BKCa
channel-mediated membrane current contributes to the

Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol (2013) 465:469–480

major firing patterns of dLGN TC neurons, burst and tonic.
In the burst mode, BKCa channels affect parameters (number
of APs) that may support an anti-oscillatory effect on network activity. Importantly, this influence is reduced in neurons of epileptic WAG/Rij. In tonic firing, β2-adrenergic
modulation of IKCa will affect the information relay to the
cortex. Although the cyclic AMP-dependent increase in Ltype and N-type Ca2+ channels [40] and the release of Ca2+
from intracellular stores, occurring during tonic firing [10],
are generally able to strongly activate BKCa channels during
membrane depolarisation, the cyclic AMP-dependent inhibition of STREX-containing channel heteromers seems to
outbalance this effect. In terms of information processing, this effect makes perfect sense, since spike frequency adaptation gets prevented and information from the
periphery is faithfully transmitted for cortical processing. It is concluded that BKCa channels exert a precisely
tuneable influence on thalamic activity modes and, in
particular, modulate the 1:1 relay of sensory information
through the thalamus.

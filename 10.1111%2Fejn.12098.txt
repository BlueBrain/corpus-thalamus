Abstract
Traditionally, neurotransmitters are associated with a fast, or phasic, type of action on neurons in the central nervous system
(CNS). However, accumulating evidence indicates that c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate can also have a continual, or
tonic, influence on these cells. Here, in voltage- and current-clamp recordings in rat brain slices, we identify three types of tonically active receptors in a single CNS structure, the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Thus, TRN contains constitutively active
GABAA receptors (GABAARs), which are located on TRN neurons and generate a persistent outward ClÀ current. When TRN
neurons are depolarized, blockade of this current increases their action potential output in response to current injection. Furthermore, TRN contains tonically active GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). These are located on reticuloreticular GABAergic terminals in TRN and generate a persistent facilitation of vesicular GABA release from these terminals. In
addition, TRN contains tonically active metabotropic glutamate type 2 receptors (mGlu2Rs). These are located on glutamatergic
cortical terminals in TRN and generate a persistent reduction of vesicular glutamate release from these terminals. Although tonically active GABAARs, NMDARs and mGlu2Rs operate through different mechanisms, we propose that the continual and combined activity of these three receptor types ultimately serves to hyperpolarize TRN neurons, which will differentially affect the
output of these cells depending upon the current state of their membrane potential. Thus, when TRN cells are relatively depolarized, their firing in single-spike tonic mode will be reduced, whereas when these cells are relatively hyperpolarized, their ability to
fire in multispike burst mode will be facilitated.

Introduction
Neurotransmitters are usually associated with a fast (phasic) type of
action on neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), but mounting evidence indicates that c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate can also have a persistent (tonic) inﬂuence on these cells
(Semyanov et al., 2004; Cavelier et al., 2005; Farrant & Nusser,
2005; Glykys & Mody, 2007; Featherstone & Shippy, 2008; Brickley
& Mody, 2012). Unlike receptors located at the synapse that
respond phasically to relatively high concentrations of synaptically
released neurotransmitter, tonically active receptors are located at
perisynaptic or extrasynaptic sites and continually respond to relatively low concentrations of ambient GABA and glutamate in the
extracellular space. Postsynaptically, tonically active receptors will
affect neuronal excitability by continually generating a membrane
conductance. Presynaptically, tonically active receptors will affect
this excitability by continually modulating the inhibitory or excitatory ‘tone’ that results from vesicular release of GABA or glutamate, respectively. In the thalamus, control of neuronal excitability

is thought to depend on the interactions among intrinsic membrane
conductances and relatively long-lasting changes in membrane
potentials due to activation of postsynaptic receptors (Sherman &
Guillery, 2001). However, this view should be broadened to take
into account the effects of tonically active receptors in the thalamus
(Belelli et al., 2005; Cope et al., 2005; Jia et al., 2005; Bright
et al., 2007; Bright & Brickley, 2008).
The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a sheet of GABAergic
neurons (Houser et al., 1980) that surrounds much of the lateral
and rostral margins of the main body of thalamic relay nuclei.
TRN neurons receive glutamatergic inputs from collaterals of
axons arising from thalamocortical (TC) neurons (Jones, 1975) and
layer VI corticothalamic (CT) neurons (Bourassa et al., 1995). The
main targets of TRN GABAergic outputs are TC neurons (Jones,
1975). Thus, TRN neurons provide a strong inhibitory innervation
of TC neurons (Cox et al., 1997; Kim & McCormick, 1998),
which will strongly inﬂuence their transfer of sensory information
to cortex (Salt, 1989; Lee et al., 1994a,b; Warren & Jones, 1994;
Hartings & Simons, 2000; Cotillon-Williams et al., 2008). Therefore, mechanisms regulating the excitability of TRN neurons will
make important contributions to the control of information ﬂow
through the thalamus.

Tonic receptors in the thalamic reticular nucleus 851
Several mechanisms intrinsic to TRN have been identiﬁed that
regulate the excitability of its neurons, including chemical (SanchezVives et al., 1997; Deleuze & Huguenard, 2006; Lam et al., 2006;
Mistry et al., 2008) and electrical (Landisman et al., 2002; Long
et al., 2004) synapses, depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (Sun et al., 2011) and short-term depression at glutamatergic
synapses (Mistry et al., 2008). However, demonstration of additional
regulatory mechanisms in TRN that are mediated by tonically active
receptors has been inconclusive (Belelli et al., 2005; Cope et al.,
2005; Jia et al., 2005; Alexander & Godwin, 2006). Here we show
that TRN contains three types of tonically active receptors, postsynaptic GABAA receptors (GABAARs), presynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and presynaptic metabotropic glutamate
type 2 receptors (mGlu2Rs). Although operating through different
mechanisms, the combined and continual activity of these three
types of receptors will be to hyperpolarize TRN neurons.

Materials and methods
Thalamic slice preparation
All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the
UK Animals (Scientiﬁc Procedures) Act 1986 and were ethically
approved by the University of Bristol. Young (14–21 days old)
Wistar rats of either sex were killed by cervical dislocation. The
brain was rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold oxygenated (95%
O2, 5% CO2) artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (ACSF). Horizontal slices
(500 lm thick) were cut through the thalamus on a vibratome and
were allowed to recover in oxygenated ACSF for at least 1 h at
room temperature (19–22 °C). Slices were then transferred to a
recording chamber and submerged beneath continuously perfusing
oxygenated ACSF. The ACSF contained (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5
KCl, 1.0 NaH2PO4, 26.2 NaHCO3, 11.0 glucose, 2.5 CaCl2 and 1.3
MgSO4.
Electrophysiology
Using 3–5 MΩ glass electrodes, whole-cell voltage- or currentclamp recordings were made from neurons in a centroventral sector
of TRN (Crabtree & Isaac, 2002). Transilluminating a slice created
contrast interference patterns that allowed visualization of TRN and
adjacent thalamic nuclei (Crabtree & Isaac, 2002; Mistry et al.,
2008).
During experiments a recording electrode was advanced ‘blind’
through a slice and only one neuron per slice was recorded. For
voltage-clamp recordings, the whole-cell solution contained (in mM):
135 Cs methane sulphonate, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 3.0 NaCl, 5.0
QX-314, 4.0 Mg-ATP and 0.3 Na-GTP, pH 7.2 using CsOH (275–
280 mOsm). For current-clamp recordings, the whole-cell solution
contained (in mM): 130 K methane sulphonate, 5.0 HEPES, 0.2
EGTA, 8.5 NaCl, 4.0 Mg-ATP and 0.5 Na-GTP, pH 7.2 using
KOH (275–280 mOsm). During voltage-clamp recordings, different
combinations of 6-imino-3(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(6H)-pyridazinebutanoic acid hydrobromide (gabazine; 50 or 100 lM) or picrotoxin
(50 lM), 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-,1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7sulfonamide (NBQX; 2 lM), D-(À)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic
acid (D-AP5; 50 lM) and tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 lM) were bath
applied in the ACSF to block synaptic currents mediated by
GABAARs, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid
receptors (AMPARs), NMDARs and action potentials presynaptic to
a recorded cell, respectively, as speciﬁed for the various experimental procedures. During voltage-clamp recordings, caesium ions and

QX-314 in the whole-cell solution blocked postsynaptic currents
mediated by GABAB receptors (GABABRs). In some of these
recordings, (5R, 10S)-(–)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]
cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801; 3 mM) was included in
the whole-cell solution (iMK-801) to block postsynaptic NMDARmediated currents. To ensure blockade of these currents, neurons
were depolarized to –10 mV for 10 s once every min for 10 min
after whole-cell access (Woodhall et al., 2001). In other voltageclamp recordings, guanosine 5′-[b-thio]diphosphate trilithium salt
(GDPbS; 1 mM) was included in the whole-cell solution to block
postsynaptic mGluR-mediated currents (Lee & McCormick, 1997;
Cox & Sherman, 1999; Alexander & Godwin, 2006) and data acquisition began 20 min after whole-cell access. All drugs were obtained
from Ascent Scientiﬁc (Avonmouth, UK) except for Ro 25-6981,
which was obtained from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK), and picrotoxin and GDPbS, which were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (St
Louis, MO, USA). During voltage-clamp recordings, cells were held
at 0 mV or À60 mV as speciﬁed for the various experimental procedures. During current-clamp recordings, the membrane potential
was close to À55 mV. Using an in-line heater (Scientiﬁca, Uckﬁeld,
UK), all recordings were made at close to physiological temperature
(32–35 °C).
Data acquisition and analysis
Recordings were made using an Axopatch 200B ampliﬁer (Axon
Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA). Data were ﬁltered at 5 kHz,
digitized at 10 kHz, and stored on computer. Holding current (DC),
series resistance (Rs), input resistance (Rm), inhibitory postsynaptic
currents (IPSCs), miniature inhibitory (or excitatory) postsynaptic
currents [mI(E)PSCs] and action potentials were displayed on-line
using WinLTP (Anderson & Collingridge, 2007). Data were acceptable from neurons with a stable whole-cell access (on average about
25 MΩ) or were discarded if the Rs changed by > 20%. DC was
measured at the beginning of 2-s periods sampled every 4 s. DC
measurements were discarded if they fell on IPSCs. Rm was measured at the beginning of 5-s periods sampled every 20 s or at the
beginning of each of six 5-s periods sampled every 2 min. Rm measurements were discarded if they fell on mIPSCs or mEPSCs. During a 5-min baseline period, 100–120 IPSCs were sampled and
averaged for each neuron using Clampﬁt (Axon Instruments). The
total IPSC current, or IPSC charge transfer (integral of the average
IPSC) multiplied by IPSC frequency, was then determined for each
cell. mIPSCs were recorded over 5-s periods sampled every 20 s
and 18–24 trials were given before and after a 10-min wash-in of an
agonist or antagonist. mEPSCs were recorded over 5-s periods for
six trials sampled every 2 min. Amplitudes and frequencies of mI
(E)PSCs were analysed using Mini-Analysis (Synaptosoft, Decatur,
GA, USA). Detection threshold for mI(E)PSCs was 10 pA. Action
potentials were recorded over 200-ms current-pulse periods sampled
every 10 s and 72 trials were given before and after a 10-min washin of picrotoxin (50 lM). Pooled data are expressed as cumulative
probabilities or as means Æ SEM. Statistical signiﬁcance was
assessed using the Wilcoxon matched-pair test or Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test. Differences were considered signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.

852 J. W. Crabtree et al.
et al., 2008). During such blockade, we observed that the amplitudes of the ﬁrst evoked EPSPs in response trains increased compared with baseline amplitudes. This suggested that, in addition to
intra-TRN inhibition, another source of inhibition was present in
TRN because, under control conditions, the ﬁrst evoked EPSP in a
response train will occur much earlier than any inﬂuence that intraTRN inhibition will have on neuronal responses. Tonically active
GABAARs were a likely candidate to account for this other source
of inhibition (Semyanov et al., 2004; Cavelier et al., 2005; Farrant
& Nusser, 2005; Glykys & Mody, 2007; Belelli et al., 2009; Brickley & Mody, 2012). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that tonically active GABAARs are present on TRN neurons.
TRN neurons were recorded in voltage-clamp mode and held at
0 mV in the presence of NBQX (2 lM) and D-AP5 (50 lM). Bathapplied gabazine (50 lM, n = 11; 100 lM, n = 3) abolished phasic
IPSCs and had no affect on the holding current (Fig. 1A). However,
bath-applied picrotoxin (50 lM) not only abolished phasic IPSCs but
also caused a reduction in an outward holding current (Fig. 1B); in
15 of 18 TRN neurons (83.3%), there was a signiﬁcant shift in holding current averaged over the last 5 min compared with the holding
current averaged over the ﬁrst 5 min of each experiment (Fig. 1C).
The amplitude of this current shift was 21.1 Æ 8.9 pA. These ﬁndings are consistent with the blockade of constitutively active postsynaptic GABAARs that mediate a tonic ClÀ current. Because of
this persistent current, constitutively active postsynaptic GABAARs
would provide a mechanism for reducing the excitability of TRN
neurons.
The proportions of the total intra-TRN GABAAR inhibition mediated by phasic and tonic currents were estimated. For the 15 TRN
neurons in which a tonic current was observed, IPSCs contributed
5.1 Æ 4.7% (1.0 Æ 0.5 of 22.1 Æ 9.4 pA) of the total GABAARmediated current, whereas the tonic component contributed
94.9 Æ 4.7% (21.1 Æ 8.9 of 22.1 Æ 9.4 pA) of this total current.
Thus, most (> 90%) of the intra-TRN GABAAR-mediated inhibition
is carried by tonically active GABAARs.

Tonic receptors in the thalamic reticular nucleus 853
geniculate nucleus (Cope et al., 2005), tonically active GABAARs
reduce action potential output of neurons. Therefore, we tested the
effect of tonic postsynaptic GABAARs on the excitability of TRN
neurons. TRN neurons (n = 10) were recorded in current-clamp
mode and held close to –55 mV before and during the presence of
bath-applied picrotoxin (50 lM). Under control conditions, these
cells ﬁred action potentials (spikes) in response to current injections
(200-ms pulses) and the spike frequency increased with increasing
levels of current injection (Fig. 1D). Compared with control, the
spike frequency signiﬁcantly increased at all levels of current injection used, except the lowest level, in the presence of picrotoxin
(Fig. 1D). Thus, removal of the tonic GABAAR-mediated current by
picrotoxin increases the excitability of TRN neurons.
TRN contains tonically active NMDARs
Axon terminals in neocortex (Berretta & Jones, 1996; Corlew
et al., 2007; Brasier & Feldman, 2008), hippocampus (Breukel
et al., 1998) and cerebellum (Glitsch & Marty, 1999) exhibit
tonically active NMDARs. These receptors continually facilitate the
vesicular release of GABA or glutamate onto a neuron depending
on whether the recipient neuron is GABAergic or glutamatergic,
respectively. Thus, an additional mechanism possibly involved in
affecting the excitability of TRN neurons is the tonic activation of
NMDARs on GABAergic terminals. Therefore, we next investigated whether such receptors are also present on GABAergic terminals
in TRN.
TRN neurons were recorded in voltage-clamp mode and held at
0 mV. By electrically stimulating TC and CT axons (see Mistry
et al., 2008), we initially recorded EPSCs evoked in TRN neurons
(n = 3) in the presence of bath-applied NBQX (2 lM) and conﬁrmed that intracellularly applied MK-801 (iMK-801; 3 mM) was
effective in blocking postsynaptic NMDARs (Fig. 2A, inset). In
control conditions, outward mIPSCs (Fig. 2A–C) were recorded in
the presence of TTX (1 lM), NBQX (2 lM) and iMK-801 (3 mM).
The presence of tonically active presynaptic NMDARs was then
tested by recording mIPSCs under two conditions: during bath
application of an NMDAR agonist (NMDA) or an NMDAR antagonist (D-AP5) In six of six TRN neurons, there was no change in
the amplitudes of mIPSCs (Fig. 2A left and D left) but the frequency of mIPSCs signiﬁcantly increased (Fig. 2A right and D
right) following wash-in of NMDA (40 lM). This increase in
mIPSC frequency was 22.0 Æ 3.6%. In eight of eight TRN neurons,
there was again no change in the amplitudes of mIPSCs (Fig. 2B
left and D left) but the frequency of mIPSCs now signiﬁcantly
decreased (Fig. 2B right and D right) following wash-in of D-AP5
(50 lM). This decrease in mIPSC frequency was 39.5 Æ 1.4%.
Additional wash-in of picrotoxin (50 lM) abolished the mIPSCs,
indicating that they were mediated by GABAARs (Fig. 2B insert).
That there were changes only in the frequencies of mIPSCs in the
presence of NMDA or D-AP5 is indicative of the presence of presynaptic NMDARs. That the frequency of mIPSCs decreased below
the baseline level in the presence of D-AP5 indicates that these presynaptic NMDARs are tonically active and facilitate the release of
GABA from terminals in TRN. Tonically active NMDARs are
reported to contain a GluN2B subunit (Woodhall et al., 2001;
Brasier & Feldman, 2008; Larsen et al., 2011). We then tested
whether the tonic NMDARs in TRN contained this subunit by
recording mIPSCs during bath application of a GluN2B antagonist
Ro 25-6981 ((aR,bS)-a-(4-hydroxyphenyl)- b-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinepropanol maleate). In six of six TRN neurons,
there was no change in the amplitudes of mIPSCs (Fig. 2C left and

D left) but the frequency of mIPSCs signiﬁcantly decreased
(Fig. 2C right and D right) following wash-in of Ro 25-6981
(3 lM). This decrease in mIPSC frequency was only 28.1 Æ 2.2%,
suggesting that tonically active NMDARs on GABAergic terminals
in TRN may contain a subunit other than GluN2B. For the neurons
in the above experiments, there was no change in Rm following
wash-in of NMDA (40 lM; baseline, 101.6 Æ 9.7 MΩ; NMDA,
98.4 Æ 8.4 MΩ; P > 0.05; Wilcoxon matched-pair test), D-AP5
(50 lM; baseline, 125.1 Æ 7.0 MΩ; D-AP5, 128.7 Æ 6.9 MΩ;
P > 0.05; Wilcoxon matched-pair test) or Ro 25-6981 (3 lM; baseline, 123.7 Æ 8.0 MΩ; Ro 25-6981, 126.4 Æ 8.3 MΩ; P > 0.05;
Wilcoxon matched-pair test).
For the baseline periods, the cumulative probability plots for
inter-mIPSC intervals for the NMDA (Fig. 2A right), D-AP5
(Fig. 2B right) and Ro 25-6981 (Fig. 2C right) conditions indicate
substantial between-cell variability in mIPSC frequency. Although
this variability was evident when the inter-mIPSC interval data were
plotted for each neuron in the NMDA (Fig. 3A), D-AP5 (Fig. 3B)
and Ro 25-6981 (Fig. 3C) conditions, all the cells in each condition
showed the same downward or upward shift in mean inter-mIPSC
interval following agonist or antagonist application, respectively.
Furthermore, there was no indication that these applications had
stronger or weaker effects on cells with substantially different basal
mIPSC frequencies.
TRN contains tonically active mGlu2Rs
Axon terminals in hippocampus (Losonczy et al., 2003; Lauri
et al., 2006) and hypothalamus (Boudaba et al., 2003; AcunaGoycolea et al., 2004) exhibit tonically active mGluRs. These
receptors continually reduce the vesicular release of glutamate onto
a neuron. Thus, another possible mechanism involved in affecting
the excitability of TRN neurons is the tonic activation of mGluRs
on glutamatergic terminals. Although presynaptic Group II
mGluRs (mGlu2R and mGlu3R) do not appear to be present at
thalamoreticular synapses (Ohishi et al., 1993a,b), such presynaptic
mGluRs are present at corticoreticular synapses and are presumably mGlu2Rs (Alexander & Godwin, 2006). Therefore, we next
investigated whether these presumptive mGlu2Rs are tonically
active.
TRN neurons were recorded in voltage-clamp mode and held
at À60 mV. In control conditions, inward mEPSCs (Fig. 4A and C)
were recorded in the presence of TTX (1 lM), D-AP5 (50 lM) and
picrotoxin (50 lM). In addition, GDPbS (1 mM) was included in the
intracellular recording solution to block any postsynaptic effects of
mGluRs (Lee & McCormick, 1997; Cox & Sherman, 1999; Alexander & Godwin, 2006). The presence of tonically active presynaptic
mGlu2Rs was then tested by recording mEPSCs under two conditions: during bath application of a selective mGlu2R agonist,
(1SR,2SR,4RS,5RS,6SR)-2-amino-4-methylbicyclo[3.1.0]-hexane2,6dicarboxylic acid (LY395756; Dominguez et al., 2005; Ceolin
et al., 2011), or a selective Group II mGluR antagonist, (2S,1′S,2′S)2-(9-xanthylmethyl)-2-(2′-carboxycyclopropylglycine
(LY341495;
Kingston et al., 1998). Bath application of LY395756 (3 lM) caused
a reversible decrease in the frequency of mEPSCs (Fig. 4A). In
three of three TRN neurons, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in mEPSC frequency averaged over the points at 18–24 min compared
with the mEPSC frequency averaged over the points at 2–10 min
(Fig. 4B). This decrease was 36.3 Æ 3.4%. In comparing these two
time periods, there was no change in the amplitudes of mEPSCs
(baseline, 16.4 Æ 0.6 pA; LY395756, 16.1 Æ 1.1 pA; P > 0.05;
Wilcoxon matched-pair test). In contrast, bath application of

percentages of the average baseline response before NMDA, D-AP5 or Ro
25-6981 application. Compared with baseline, the mIPSC amplitudes did not
signiﬁcantly differ after the various agonist or antagonist wash-ins (P > 0.05;
Wilcoxon matched-pair tests) but the mIPSC frequency signiﬁcantly
increased after NMDA wash-in (*P < 0.05; Wilcoxon matched-pair test) or
decreased after D-AP5 or Ro 25-6981 wash-in (*P < 0.05; Wilcoxon
matched-pair tests).

18–24 min compared with the mEPSC frequency averaged over the
points at 2–10 min (Fig. 4D). This increase was 52.9 Æ 4.9%. In
comparing these two time periods, there was no change in the
amplitudes of mEPSCs (Fig. 4E left) but the frequency of mEPSCs
signiﬁcantly increased (Fig. 4E right). Additional wash-in of NBQX
(2 lM) abolished the mEPSCs, indicating that they were mediated
by AMPARs (Fig. 4E insert). That there were changes only in
the frequency of mEPSCs in the presence of LY341495 is indicative
of the presence of presynaptic mGlu2Rs. That the frequency of
mEPSCs increased above the baseline level in the presence of
LY341495 indicates that these presynaptic mGlu2Rs are tonically
active and reduce the release of glutamate from terminals in TRN.
During bath application of LY395756 (3 lM) or LY341495
(300 nM) there was no change in Rm averaged over the points at
18–24 min compared with the baseline Rm averaged over the
points at 2–10 min (baseline, 162.8 Æ 16.6 MΩ; LY395756,
163.8 Æ 16.1 MΩ; P > 0.05; Wilcoxon matched-pair test; baseline,

LY341495 (300 nM) caused a reversible increase in the frequency of
mEPSCs (Fig. 4C). In eight of eight TRN neurons, there was a signiﬁcant increase in mEPSC frequency averaged over the points at

synaptic GABAARs, which generate in TRN neurons a persistent
outward ClÀ current approximately 21 pA in amplitude. Furthermore, TRN exhibits tonically active GluN2B-containing NMDARs
on reticuloreticular GABAergic terminals, which generate a continual facilitation of GABA release as indicated by an approximately
40 or 28% decrease in the frequency of mIPSCs when these
NMDARs are blocked by D-AP5 or Ro 25-6981, respectively.
Moreover, TRN contains tonically active mGlu2Rs on corticoreticular glutamatergic terminals, which generate a continual reduction of
glutamate release as indicated by an approximately 53% increase in
the frequency of mEPSCs when these mGlu2Rs are blocked by
LY341495. Therefore, each of these receptor types serves to hyperpolarize TRN neurons. It remains to be determined whether individual TRN neurons are inﬂuenced by all three of these tonically active
receptor types.
The presence of tonically active GABAARs appears ubiquitous in
the CNS. Neurons containing these receptors are found in the neocortex (Salin & Prince, 1996; Krook-Magnuson et al., 2008), dentate gyrus (Nusser & Mody, 2002; Stell & Mody, 2002),
hippocampus (Bai et al., 2001; Semyanov et al., 2003), dorsal striatum (Ade et al., 2008), amygdala (Marowsky et al., 2012), thalamic

relay nuclei (Porcello et al., 2003; Belelli et al., 2005; Cope et al.,
2005; Jia et al., 2005), cerebellum (Kaneda et al., 1995; Brickley
et al., 1996; Wall & Usowicz, 1997) and spinal cord (Wang et al.,
2008). However, in contrast to previous studies in rodents (Belelli
et al., 2005; Cope et al., 2005; Jia et al., 2005), we now ﬁnd tonically active GABAARs in TRN. The discrepancy between our ﬁndings and these previous studies is most likely due to the types of
GABAAR antagonists used. Whereas the earlier studies used only
competitive GABAAR antagonists (bicuculline or gabazine), we
used both a competitive (gabazine) and a non-competitive (picrotoxin) antagonist. But it is only when picrotoxin is used that a
reduction in holding current in TRN neurons occurs. This different
result when using a non-competitive antagonist is entirely consistent
with the presence of constitutively active GABAARs in TRN. Such
receptors do not require the endogenous ligand (GABA) to open the
channel and therefore are not sensitive to orthosteric antagonists but
are sensitive to the open channel blocker picrotoxin (Sigel et al.,
1989; Krishek et al., 1996; Bouairi et al., 2006; McCartney et al.,
2007).
In rodents, functional GABAARs are pentameric structures that
are usually composed of combinations of at least one of six a
subunits, one of three b subunits, and one of three c subunits,
although a d subunit can replace a c subunit (Pirker et al., 2000).
Different combinations of subunits will impart distinct pharmacological and electrophysiological properties onto GABAARs (Sieghart
et al., 1999; Mody & Pearce, 2004; Semyanov et al., 2004; Farrant
& Nusser, 2005; Glykys & Mody, 2007; Belelli et al., 2009; Eyre
et al., 2012). GABAARs in TRN express the a3, b3 and c2 subunits
but not the a1, a4, b2 or d subunits (Pirker et al., 2000; Eyre et al.,
2012). The combinations of subunits that make up phasic (synaptic)
and tonic (constitutively active) GABAARs in TRN are currently
unknown.
GABAARs containing b1 subunits are also expressed in the
rodent TRN (Pirker et al., 2000; Huntsman & Huguenard, 2006).
These subunits impart a much greater heterogeneity in the electrophysiological properties of GABAARs (Huntsman & Huguenard,
2006). Homomeric b1 subunit-containing GABAARs form functional ClÀ selective channels (Sigel et al., 1989; Krishek et al.,
1996). These receptors exhibit channel opening in the absence of
GABA, are insensitive to GABA and orthosteric antagonists, and
are blocked by picrotoxin. Therefore, homomeric b1 GABAARs
would be ideally suited to fulﬁl the role of constitutively active
receptors that generate a persistent outward ClÀ current in TRN neurons. If these receptors are present in TRN, they could be regulated
intracellularly by postsynaptic activation of G-protein-coupled
receptors.
Picrotoxin (50 lM) can act as a partial antagonist at homomeric
a subunit-containing glycine receptors (GlyRs; Chattipakorn &
McMahon, 2002). Therefore, the presence of these receptors in TRN
could account for the persistent outward ClÀ current that we attribute to tonically active GABAARs. GlyR a2 and b subunits are
expressed early in development in the rat TRN (Malosio et al.,
1991). Although non-ligand-binding b subunits are still expressed
here in the adult, there is no expression of ligand-binding a2 subunits in TRN on postnatal day 15 or thereafter. Because our data
investigating tonic ClÀ currents are from 2- to 3-week-old rats, it is
unlikely that blockade of GlyRs explains the picrotoxin-induced
reduction in holding current of TRN neurons.
Our data showing changes in postsynaptic miniature event frequency indicate that TRN contains tonically active presynaptic
NMDARs that continually facilitate GABA release from reticuloreticular terminals. Such presynaptic facilitation of transmitter release

Fig. 5. Summary of postsynaptic and presynaptic receptors in TRN. The
schematic shows a GABAergic neuron in TRN (R). For clarity, only a single
unbranched dendrite is shown. The receptors are those that we took into
account in this study. Receptors indicated by an asterisk, either on the dendrite, the GABAergic (GABA) axon terminal or the glutamatergic (GLUT)
axon terminal, summarize our ﬁndings regarding the presence of three types
of tonically active receptors in TRN. Receptor and terminal locations are
only approximate.

agrees with previous ﬁndings in the neocortex (Berretta & Jones,
1996; Corlew et al., 2007; Brasier & Feldman, 2008), hippocampus
(Breukel et al., 1998) and cerebellum (Glitsch & Marty, 1999). Pos-

sible presynaptic NMDARs in the somatodendritic compartment
appear to play only a small role in changing the frequency of postsynaptic miniature events (Glitsch & Marty, 1999). Thus, the presynaptic NMDARs responsible for these changes would be mostly
located in the axonal domain. These receptors contain a GluN2B
subunit that is selectively antagonized by Ro 25-6981. However,
this compound is only a partial antagonist of such subunits (Bartlett

Tonic receptors in the thalamic reticular nucleus 857
et al., 2007; Paoletti & Neyton, 2007) so that, in our experiments,
the reduction in frequency of mIPSCs by Ro 25-6981 is only about
70% of that produced by D-AP5. Therefore, the possibility remains
that not all tonically active NMDARs in TRN necessarily contain
GluN2B subunits.
Our data showing changes in postsynaptic miniature event frequency further indicate that TRN contains tonically active presynaptic mGlu2Rs that continually reduce glutamate release from
corticoreticular terminals. Such presynaptic mGluR-mediated reduction of transmitter release agrees with previous ﬁndings in the hippocampus (Losonczy et al., 2003; Lauri et al., 2006) and
hypothalamus (Boudaba et al., 2003; Acuna-Goycolea et al., 2004).
However, 3 lM LY395756 not only acts as an agonist at mGlu2Rs
but can also act as an antagonist at mGlu3Rs (Dominguez et al.,
2005; Ceolin et al., 2011). Thus, in TRN, the mGlu2R-mediated
decrease in mEPSC frequency of approximately 36% may be an
underestimation due to an opposing effect mediated by mGlu3Rs.
Furthermore, 300 nM LY341495 is not only a Group II mGluR
antagonist but can also act as an antagonist at Group III mGlu8Rs
(Kingston et al., 1998). Because TRN does not appear to express
mGlu8Rs (Saugstad et al., 1997), the increase in mEPSC frequency
of approximately 53% that we see during LY341495 application
may accurately reﬂect the antagonist effect of this compound on
mGlu2/3Rs regulating glutamate release from corticoreticular
terminals.
Presynaptic Group II mGluRs do not appear to be present at reticuloreticular synapses (Alexander & Godwin, 2006). However, the
tonically active presynaptic NMDARs that we have identiﬁed in
TRN may be expressed at other locations in this structure or TRN
may express other types of tonically active presynaptic receptors.
Thus, adenosine A1 receptors are present on GABAergic and glutamatergic terminals (Ulrich & Huguenard, 1995), GABABRs are
present on GABAergic (Ulrich & Huguenard, 1996) and thalamoreticular (Sanchez-Vives et al., 1997) terminals, Group III mGlu4Rs
are present on thalamoreticular terminals (Snead et al., 2000) and
kainate receptors are present on corticoreticular terminals (Miyata &
Imoto, 2009). All of these receptors modulate the release of neurotransmitter in TRN. Although not yet demonstrated, all of the abovementioned receptors could be tonically active. Whether TRN contains
tonically active NMDARs on glutamatergic axons/terminals was not
tested in the present study and remains to be determined.
Like the types of tonically active receptors that are present
throughout the CNS (Mody & Pearce, 2004; Semyanov et al.,
2004; Cavelier et al., 2005; Farrant & Nusser, 2005; Glykys &
Mody, 2007; Corlew et al., 2008; Featherstone & Shippy, 2008;
Belelli et al., 2009; Brickley & Mody, 2012), those in TRN are
presumably located at perisynaptic or extrasynaptic sites. Furthermore, tonically active NMDARs and mGlu2Rs on terminals in
TRN are presumably activated by relatively low concentrations of
ambient glutamate in the extracellular space. Possible sources of
this endogenous agonist, with estimated basal ambient concentrations in the low micromolar range (Cavelier et al., 2005; Featherstone & Shippy, 2008), include activity-dependent homo- and
heterosynaptic release and ‘spillover’ of neurotransmitter, activityindependent synaptic release of neurotransmitter, observed as
mEPSCs, exocytosis of neurotransmitter from axons, dendrites and
glial cells, and the cystine–glutamate transmembrane exchange system. Whatever the sources, the basal ambient concentration of glutamate, and hence the strength of tonically active NMDARs and
mGlu2Rs, is most likely under the control of glutamate transport
systems (Danbolt, 2001; Cavelier et al., 2005; Featherstone &
Shippy, 2008). High-frequency synaptic activity could temporarily

increase the strength of these tonically active receptors by momentarily increasing the ambient concentration of glutamate.
Functional implications of tonically active receptors in TRN
Our ﬁndings suggest that the three types of tonically active receptors
we have identiﬁed in TRN will act together harmoniously to hyperpolarize the membrane potential of TRN neurons. Thus, the ClÀ current
continually generated by constitutively active postsynaptic GABAARs
in TRN neurons will directly hyperpolarize the membrane potential of
these cells. Furthermore, the persistent increase in frequency of mIPSCs
generated by tonically active presynaptic NMDARs will increase the
inhibitory tone impinging on TRN neurons by increasing the amount of
GABA that is available to bind at postsynaptic GABAARs and
GABABRs. In addition, the persistent decrease in frequency of
mEPSCs generated by tonically active presynaptic mGlu2Rs will
decrease the excitatory tone impinging on TRN neurons by decreasing
the amount of glutamate that is available to bind at postsynaptic AMPARs
and NMDARs. However, because TRN neurons exhibit tonic and
burst ﬁring modes (Steriade et al., 1986; Avanzini et al., 1989; Hartings et al., 2003), which occur at relatively depolarized or hyperpolarized membrane potentials, respectively, the hyperpolarizing effects
of the tonically active receptors will differentially affect the action
potential output of these cells depending on the moment-to-moment
state of their membrane potential. Thus, when TRN neurons are depolarized, the tonically active receptors will act to reduce ﬁring in singlespike tonic mode. Indeed, we show that blockade of the persistent ClÀ
current, which accounts for more than 90% of the intra-TRN inhibition, increases the action potential output of TRN neurons (cf. Brickley et al., 1996; Hamann et al., 2002; Semyanov et al., 2003; Cope
et al., 2005). Furthermore, when TRN neurons are hyperpolarized, the
tonically active receptors will act to increase the tendency to ﬁre in
multispike burst mode through depolarizing intra-TRN GABAergic
inputs and activation of T-type Ca2+ channels (Sun et al., 2012).
Therefore, the presence of tonically active GABAARs, NMDARs and
mGlu2Rs in TRN will affect its constituent neurons by decreasing
their inhibitory output when they are relatively depolarized or increasing their inhibitory output when they are relatively hyperpolarized.

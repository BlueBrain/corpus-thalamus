GABAergic neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) form powerful inhibitory connections with several dorsal thalamic nuclei,
thereby controlling attention, sensory processing, and synchronous oscillations in the thalamocortical system. TRN neurons are interconnected by a network of GABAergic synapses, but their properties and their role in shaping TRN neuronal activity are not well
understood. Using recording techniques aimed to minimize changes in the intracellular milieu, we show that synaptic GABAA receptor
activation triggers postsynaptic depolarizations in mouse TRN neurons. Immunohistochemical data indicate that TRN neurons express
very low levels of the Cl Ϫ transporter KCC2. In agreement, perforated-patch recordings show that intracellular Cl Ϫ levels are high in TRN
neurons, resulting in a Cl Ϫ reversal potential (ECl ) significantly depolarized from rest. Additionally, we find that GABAA receptor-evoked
depolarizations are amplified by the activation of postsynaptic T-type Ca 2ϩ channels, leading to dendritic Ca 2ϩ increases and the
generation of burst firing in TRN neurons. In turn, GABA-evoked burst firing results in delayed and long-lasting feedforward inhibition
in thalamic relay cells. Our results show that GABA-evoked depolarizations can interact with T-type Ca 2ϩ channels to powerfully control
spike generation in TRN neurons.

Introduction
Located strategically between neocortex and thalamus, the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is critically involved in a number
of diverse computational tasks (Jones, 2007). It controls distinct
aspects of sensory processing such as receptive field properties
(Hartings et al., 2003) and relay cell excitability (Kim et al., 1997),
mediates selective attention (Crick, 1984; McAlonan et al., 2006),
and, in addition, generates rhythmic synchronous activity in the
thalamocortical system (McCormick and Bal, 1997). Therefore,
understanding how intrinsic and afferent synaptic connections
control TRN neuronal activity is essential to reveal the various
roles of TRN under both physiological and pathological conditions (Beenhakker and Huguenard, 2009).
Neurons in the TRN are exclusively GABAergic and form local
networks of electrical (Landisman et al., 2002; Deleuze and Huguenard, 2006) and chemical synapses (Sanchez-Vives et al.,

1997; Deleuze and Huguenard, 2006). While electrical synapses
are thought to mediate synchronous firing among small clusters
of TRN neurons (Long et al., 2004), local GABAergic connections
are assumed to have an opposing role. TRN plays a key role in
generating certain types of synchronous oscillations in the
thalamocortical system, most notably sleep spindles (Beenhakker
and Huguenard, 2009). Intra-TRN chemical synapses are
thought to be critical for limiting the number of TRN neurons
that participate in rhythmic oscillatory activity (Sohal and Huguenard, 2003). Accordingly, when intra-TRN synaptic activity is
reduced, thalamic circuits that normally mediate sparse synchronous activity can switch into a hypersynchronous state, leading to
the generation of seizure-like activity (Huntsman et al., 1999). A
role of intra-TRN GABAergic synapses in desynchronizing activity in the thalamocortical system appears to be consistent with
studies showing that activation of GABAergic inputs leads to hyperpolarizing or shunting inhibition in TRN neurons (Ahlse´n
and Lindstro¨m, 1982; Sanchez-Vives et al., 1997; Ulrich and Huguenard, 1997; Shu and McCormick, 2002). However, experimental support has mostly relied on recording techniques that
perturb [Cl Ϫ]i. Thus, our knowledge of GABAergic signaling in
the TRN remains incomplete.
By using noninvasive recording techniques and immunohistochemistry, we find that GABAergic synapses in the TRN are
depolarizing, in part mediated by an extremely low abundance of
the Cl Ϫ transporter KCC2. Furthermore, we show that GABAergic synaptic inputs can activate postsynaptic T-type Ca 2ϩ channels, leading to the generation of bursts of action potentials in
TRN neurons and the generation of powerful inhibitory inputs in
thalamic relay neurons. Thus, rather than acting solely as a shunt,

local GABAergic synaptic connections could form an important
substrate for the generation of network activity in the TRN.

Materials and Methods
Slice preparation. Thalamocortical slices (400 ␮m) were prepared from
both male and female C57BL/6J mice, P13–P35, as described previously
(Agmon and Connors, 1991). Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane
and decapitated, following procedures in accordance with NIH guidelines and approved by the University of Texas Health Science Center at
Houston animal welfare committee. Slices were cut in ice-cold solution
containing the following (in mM): 111 choline Cl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25
NaH2PO4, 10 MgSO4, 26 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, and 0.5 CaCl2, saturated
with 95% O2–5% CO2, using a vibratome (Leica VT1200S) at slicing
speeds of 0.2 mm/s and a blade vibration amplitude of 0.8 mm. Slices
were transferred to a holding chamber and incubated at 34°C for 40 min,
in saline solution containing the following (in mM): 126 NaCl, 26
NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, 2 CaCl2, and 2 MgCl2, and
then kept at room temperature before recordings.
Electrophysiology. Slices were placed on glass coverslips coated with
poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) and submerged in a recording chamber
(Warner Instruments). All experiments were performed at nearphysiological temperatures (32–34°C) using an in-line heater (Warner
Instruments) while perfusing the recording chamber with solution at
3– 4 ml/min using a Minipulse 3 pump (Gilson). Unless noted, experiments were performed in the presence of NBQX (10 ␮M), 3-(( R)-2carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (R-CPP) (5 ␮M),
(2S)-3-([(1S)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]amino-2-hydroxypropyl)
(phenylmethyl)phosphinic acid (CGP 55845) (5 ␮M), and hexamethonium (100 ␮M) to block AMPA, NMDA, GABAB, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, respectively. Recordings were obtained under
infrared– differential interference contrast visualization using an Olympus BX51WI microscope (Olympus Optical) and a CCD camera
(Hamamatsu).
Cell-attached recordings were obtained with pipettes (2–3 M⍀) filled
with ACSF, following established procedures (Perkins, 2006). For loosepatch recordings in voltage clamp, the seal resistance was 20 –100 M⍀.
For tight-seal recordings, the seal resistance was 1– 4 G⍀. In voltage
clamp, holding potential was continually monitored and adjusted to
keep the holding current near 0 pA, to minimize any influence on the
membrane potential of the recorded cell (Perkins, 2006). Cell-attached
current-clamp recordings were performed in tight-seal configuration after the measured resting membrane potential reached a steady state,
which typically occurred 5–10 min following initial seal formation.
Perforated-patch recordings were performed as described previously
(Ulrich and Huguenard, 1997), using a voltage-clamp internal solution
containing the following (in mM): 132 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 2
MgCl2, 0.16 CaCl2, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, and 5 QX-314, adjusted to
295 mOsm and pH 7.3. Gramicidin (dissolved in DMSO) was added to
the patch-clamp internal solution to obtain a final concentration of 60
␮g/ml. Perforated-patch access resistance was monitored by applying 20
mV hyperpolarizing voltage steps following seal formation. Recordings
with final access resistances ϳ50 –100 M⍀ were obtained after 15–30
min. The access resistance was calculated by analyzing the transient responses to voltage-clamp steps, following previously established procedures (Ulrich and Huguenard, 1997). Membrane potentials shown are
corrected for the voltage drop across the series resistance.
Whole-cell current-clamp recordings from TRN neurons (see Fig. 5)
were obtained with an internal solution containing the following (in
mM): 108 K-gluconate, 26 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 0.16
CaCl2, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.4 Na-GTP, adjusted to 295 mOsm and pH 7.3.
For whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of IPSCs in neurons of the ventrobasal (VB) thalamus (see Fig. 6), the internal solution contained the
following (in mM): 120 CsMeSO3, 10 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 11 EGTA, 1
MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 1 QX-314, adjusted to 295
mOsm and pH 7.3. Cells were held at 0 mV. Whole-cell voltage-clamp
recordings from TRN neurons (see Fig. 4 E, F ) were obtained with patch
pipettes (2–3 M⍀) containing the following (in mM): 93 CsMeSO3, 40
CsCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 0.16 CaCl2, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-

GTP, and 2 QX-314, adjusted to 295 mOsm and pH 7.3. Cells were held
at Ϫ70 mV.
Extracellular stimuli were evoked every 12 s with patch pipettes filled
with ACSF, placed in the TRN. Stimulation intensities ranged from 10 to
30 ␮A (200 ␮s stimulus duration). In some experiments, GABAA receptor agonists were locally applied by pressure ejection (100 –300 ms duration) via a puffer pipette (6 –10 ␮m tip diameter) controlled by a
Picrospritzer II (General Valve) and placed above the slice near the recorded neuron.
Fluorescent imaging of TRN neurons. TRN neurons were recorded in
current clamp with the K-based internal solution (30 mM Cl Ϫ) supplemented with Fluo-4 (125 ␮M) and Alexa 594 (50 ␮M). Fluo-4 was excited
at 480 nm with a monochromator (Polychrome IV; TILL Photonics).
The filter set used was 510 nm and 535 LP for emission (Omega Optical).
Images were acquired with 25 ms exposures at 20 Hz using a SensiCam
CCD camera (PCO Computer Optics).
Data acquisition and analysis. Data were acquired using pClamp software (Molecular Devices). Recordings were filtered at 2–10 kHz and
digitized at 20 kHz with a 16 bit analog-to digital converter (Digidata
1440A; Molecular Devices). Data analysis was performed with custom
macros written in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics). Statistical test were performed with the unpaired or paired Student t test. Differences are considered to be significant at p Ͻ 0.05. Data are presented as mean Ϯ SEM.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical staining was performed as described previously (Wu et al., 2010). Wild-type C57BL/6
mice at postnatal day 26 were deeply anesthetized and transcardially
perfused with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS, pH 7.4. The brains were postfixed with the same fixative overnight
at 4°C. Brains were sectioned into 50-␮m-thick sections with a vibrating
microtome (Leica VT1000S) in the coronal plane. Free-floating sections
were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS
at room temperature for 5 min. Sections were then washed with PBS,
blocked for 1 h with 3% normal goat serum in PBS at room temperature,
and then incubated with a mixture of two primary antibodies: mouse
anti-KCC2 (1:200; University of California at Davis/NIH Neuromab Facility) and rabbit anti-GAD67 (1:1000; Invitrogen) in PBS with 2 mg/ml
BSA and 1% normal goat serum at 4°C overnight. Sections were then
washed with PBS and incubated with the following fluorescent secondary
antibodies: goat anti-mouse IgG-Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; 1:500); goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa 488 (Invitrogen; 1:500) in
PBS at room temperature for 2 h. Following this incubation, sections
were counterstained with DAPI (1:10,000; Invitrogen), washed with PBS
four times for 10 min each, and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss 710 system.

Results
Activation of GABAergic synapses triggers burst firing in
TRN neurons
We examined the properties of intra-TRN synapses by recording
from TRN neurons in thalamocortical slices of 2- to 5-week-old
mice. To isolate GABAergic synaptic inputs, we blocked excitatory synaptic transmission pharmacologically. We first recorded
from TRN cells using loose-patch recordings (Perkins, 2006) to
avoid perturbing [Cl Ϫ]i. Under these conditions, we found that
activation of intra-TRN GABAergic synapses with single stimuli
reliably triggered bursts of action potentials in TRN cells (latency,
14.1 Ϯ 1.3 ms; duration of burst, 21.3 Ϯ 1.6 ms; 5.7 Ϯ 0.4 spikes
per burst; n ϭ 12). Synaptically evoked burst firing was completely blocked by bath application of the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine (10 ␮M) in all cells examined (5.2 Ϯ 0.3 spikes in
control; 0 spikes in gabazine; n ϭ 6; p Ͻ 0.001; Fig. 1 A, B). We
have previously shown that endocannabinoids can reduce GABA
release from intra-TRN synapses, while having no effect on the postsynaptic membrane properties (Sun et al., 2011). Consistent with an
essential role of GABAergic synaptic transmission in triggering burst
firing in TRN neurons, synaptically evoked action potentials were
eliminated by bath application of the cannabinoid receptor agonist

vation of intra-TRN synapses led to short-latency depolarizations
from the resting membrane potential, followed by the generation
of action potentials (Fig. 1 E), independent of animal age (P13–
P35). Both the depolarization and action potentials were blocked
by bath application of the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine
(10 ␮M) (Fig. 1 F). Thus, activation of GABAergic synapses
evokes postsynaptic depolarizations that lead to bursts of action
potentials.
The experiments outlined above were conducted in the presence of CGP 55845 to block GABAB receptors. TRN neurons
express GABAB receptors in their dendrites (Ulrich and Huguenard, 1996), so it is possible that their activation attenuates
GABAA-induced depolarizations under physiological conditions.
However, we found that GABAergic synaptic inputs triggered
spikes even in the absence of GABAB receptor blockers (data not
shown), consistent with previous work demonstrating that in
TRN GABAB receptors only make a minor contribution to the
composite GABAergic PSP (Ulrich and Huguenard, 1996).

1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-napthalenylmethanone (WIN55,
212) (Fig. 1C,D). Together, these results suggest that activation of
postsynaptic GABAA receptors by release of GABA from intra-TRN
synapses can reliably trigger action potentials in TRN neurons.
Activation of GABAergic synaptic inputs can evoke postsynaptic hyperpolarizations, which for a number of cell types is followed by a rebound depolarization and the generation of bursts
of action potentials (Steriade et al., 1993; Aizenman et al., 1998),
a mechanism that could in principle explain our findings. To
determine the polarity of the GABA-induced postsynaptic membrane potential (PSP) changes in TRN neurons without influencing the intracellular milieu, we used tight-seal cell-attached
current-clamp recordings (Perkins, 2006). While the amplitude
of the GABA-evoked PSP is likely attenuated in this recording
configuration, accurate estimates of both resting membrane potential and polarity of membrane potential changes can be obtained. We found that the average resting membrane potential of
TRN neurons was Ϫ75.1 Ϯ 1.3 mV (n ϭ 12). Importantly, acti-

Activation of TRN somatodendritic GABAA receptors evokes
postsynaptic depolarizations
While GABAA receptor-mediated depolarizations have been observed for a number of neuronal types throughout the mature
brain, they are often confined to axonal compartments (Jang et
al., 2001; Szabadics et al., 2006; Pugh and Jahr, 2011). By contrast,
activation of dendritic GABAA receptors typically results in hyperpolarizing or shunting inhibition (Szabadics et al., 2006;
Glickfeld et al., 2009), indicating that neurons can maintain different levels of [Cl Ϫ]i in distinct subcellular compartments.
While the existence of functional intra-TRN GABAergic synaptic
connections is well established (Deleuze and Huguenard, 2006;
Lam et al., 2006), their ultrastructure and location on the somatodendritic membrane are not well understood (Pinault, 2004).
To determine whether a widespread activation of GABAA receptors expressed in TRN neurons mirrors the effect of synaptic
activation, we recorded from TRN neurons in loose-patch configuration and applied GABA via brief puffs (300 ␮M; 100 ms),
using a glass pipette placed near the recorded cell. GABAB receptors were blocked pharmacologically. Under these conditions,
activation of GABAA receptors led to the generation of action
potentials, which could be reversibly blocked by bath application
of gabazine (control, 5.1 Ϯ 0.3 spikes; gabazine, 0 spikes; washout, 5.1 Ϯ 1.2 spikes; n ϭ 5; p Ͻ 0.001, paired t test; Fig. 2 A, C,E).
To confirm that action potentials were triggered by a GABAA
receptor-mediated depolarization, we recorded from TRN neurons in cell-attached current-clamp recording configuration. In
the presence of TTX (500 nM), brief applications of the GABAA
receptor agonist muscimol (100 ␮M; 200 ms duration) induced
depolarizing responses in all TRN neurons tested. An example is
shown in Figure 2, B and D. Depolarizing responses were reversibly blocked by bath application of gabazine (control, 12.2 Ϯ 1.8
mV; gabazine, 1.1 Ϯ 0.3 mV; washout, 11.7 Ϯ 1.6 mV; n ϭ 5; p Ͻ
0.001, paired t test; Fig. 2 F). Thus, TRN neurons appear to maintain uniformly high levels of [Cl Ϫ]i, suggesting that activation of
GABAergic synapses located throughout the somatodendritic region will evoke GABAA receptor-mediated depolarizations. To
directly determine the reversal potential of the GABAA receptormediated current without perturbing [Cl Ϫ]i, we used perforatedpatch recordings by including gramicidin in the recording
solution (Ulrich and Huguenard, 1997). These experiments were
performed in the presence of TTX (500 nM) to avoid contamination of the postsynaptic current by action potential activity. We
found that currents evoked by brief applications of the GABAA

Blaesse et al., 2009). NKCC1 accumulates Cl Ϫ ions via the
cotransport of Cl Ϫ into cells using the Na ϩ concentration gradient; KCC2, however, extrudes Cl Ϫ from neurons using the K ϩ
concentration gradient. Thus, the high levels of [Cl Ϫ]i in TRN
neurons could be determined by a low expression of KCC2. To
test this hypothesis, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of KCC2 expression in thalamic nuclei of P26 mice. We found
that KCC2 was virtually nonexistent in the TRN (Fig. 3 A, B),
while the neighboring ventrobasal complex [ventral posterolateral nucleus of thalamus (VPL) and ventral posteromedial nucleus of thalamus (VPM)] showed strong expression (Fig. 3 A, C),
in agreement with the KCC2 expression pattern in rat thalamus
(Bartho´ et al., 2004). Thus, the high levels of [Cl Ϫ]i maintained in
TRN neurons are at least in part due to a low expression of the
chloride transporter KCC2.

receptor agonist muscimol (100 ␮M; 200 ms duration) had a
reversal potential of Ϫ45.0 mV (range, Ϫ46.1 to Ϫ39.5 mV; n ϭ
5). An example is shown in Figure 2G. Collectively, our data
suggest that TRN neurons maintain a uniformly high [Cl Ϫ]i
(20 –30 mM), causing ECl to be positive to resting membrane
potential and GABAA receptor activation to generate depolarizing synaptic responses.
Low expression of KCC2 in the TRN
For many types of neurons, [Cl Ϫ]i is primarily determined by the
two Cl Ϫ transporters NKCC1 and KCC2 (Rivera et al., 1999;

GABA-triggered action potentials in the TRN require
activation of T-type Ca 2؉ channels
If ECl is more positive than spike threshold, GABA-induced depolarizations should be sufficient to trigger the generation of Na ϩ spikes
in the axon of TRN neurons. Alternatively, postsynaptic lowthreshold conductances such as T-type Ca 2ϩ channels might be critically involved in amplifying postsynaptic GABAergic responses. In
TRN neurons, T-type Ca 2ϩ channels composed of Cav3.2 and
Cav3.3. subunits (Talley et al., 1999) are expressed in high densities
throughout the dendritic tree (Destexhe et al., 1996; Crandall et al.,
2010) and are critically involved in rhythmic burst firing typical for
certain stages of sleep (Cueni et al., 2008). Studies on a number of
neuronal types have suggested that T-type Ca 2ϩ channels expressed
in dendrites might serve to amplify glutamatergic synaptic inputs
(Magee et al., 1995; Gillessen and Alzheimer, 1997; Urban et al.,
1998; Crandall et al., 2010). However, the lack of a selective antagonist has complicated efforts to isolate the effects of T-type Ca 2ϩ
channel activation in a given cell type. Here, we tested the role of
T-type Ca 2ϩ channels in GABA-evoked spike generation, by using the selective antagonist 3,5-dichloro-N-[1-(2,2-dimethyltetrahydro-pyran-4-ylmethyl)-4-fluoro-piperidin-4-ylmethyl]benzamide(TTA-P2) (Dreyfus et al., 2010). In all TRN cells
examined, bath application of TTA-P2 (1 ␮M) completely eliminated synaptically evoked bursting (4.8 Ϯ 0.4 spikes in control; 0
spikes in TTA-P2; n ϭ 5; p Ͻ 0.001, paired t test; Fig. 4 A, B),
indicating that the activation of T-type Ca 2ϩ channels is an essential requirement for GABA-evoked action potentials in the
TRN. For neurons held in cell-attached current clamp, TTA-P2
eliminated fast events reflecting Na ϩ-dependent action potentials, revealing a depolarizing postsynaptic response (Fig. 4C).
This remaining component was blocked by bath application of
gabazine (10 ␮M) (Fig. 4C,D), indicating that it likely reflected an
isolated GABAA receptor-mediated depolarization. TTA-P2 had
no effect on the properties of Na ϩ-dependent action potentials
or on the frequency of tonic firing evoked by current steps from a
depolarized membrane potential (data not shown), at which Ttype Ca 2ϩ channels are inactivated, indicating that TTA-P2 did
not influence Na ϩ channel kinetics, consistent with a previous
report (Dreyfus et al., 2010). It is possible that T-type Ca 2ϩ channels are involved in the release of GABA, which in principle could
explain the observed block of synaptically evoked spike bursts by
TTA-P2. To examine this possibility directly, we recorded
GABAergic postsynaptic currents (PSCs) from TRN neurons under whole-cell voltage clamp. As shown in Figure 4, E and F, bath
application of TTA-P2 (1 ␮M) did not influence PSC amplitude
(347.0 Ϯ 155.3 pA in control; 342.4 Ϯ 146.1 pA in TTA-P2;

control; 0.80 Ϯ 0.06 in TTA-P2; n ϭ 5; p ϭ 0.72, paired t test),
indicating that T-type Ca 2ϩ channels are not involved in regulating GABA release from intra-TRN synapses. Thus, T-type Ca 2ϩ
channels expressed in TRN dendrites are required for GABAinduced burst firing in the TRN.
Activation of T-type Ca 2؉ channels is responsible for Ca 2؉
influx induced by GABA
To confirm the essential role of T-type Ca 2ϩ channels in amplifying GABAergic responses, we performed whole-cell currentclamp recordings from TRN neurons, using an internal solution
with 30 mM Cl Ϫ aimed to set ECl to values determined by our
perforated-patch recordings outlined above. When neurons were
held between Ϫ75 and Ϫ70 mV, synaptic stimulation triggered
bursts of action potentials with properties similar to the results
obtained with cell-attached recordings (Fig. 5 A, B). The threshold for action potential generation, measured at the time corresponding to the initial peak of the third derivative of the voltage
trace, was Ϫ35.3 Ϯ 2.3 mV (n ϭ 5). When neurons were depolarized to Ϫ60 mV to inactivate Ca 2ϩ channels, GABAergic responses no longer elicited action potentials in most neurons (Fig.
5 A, B). For the same neurons held between Ϫ75 and Ϫ70 mV,
pharmacological block of T-type Ca 2ϩ channels with TTA-P2
also eliminated action potential firing (control, 3.8 Ϯ 0.1 spikes;
TTA-P2, 0 spikes; p Ͻ 0.001, paired t test; Fig. 5 A, B). These data
confirm that GABA-evoked depolarizations alone are not sufficient to reach the threshold for spike generation. Rather, GABAinduced burst firing is strongly state dependent and relies on the
activation of low-threshold Ca 2ϩ channels from a hyperpolarized membrane potential.

To determine the contribution of T-type Ca 2ϩ channels to
GABA-evoked Ca 2ϩ influx, we loaded TRN neurons with the
Ca 2ϩ indicator Fluo-4 (125 ␮M) and recorded dendritic Ca 2ϩ
transients using a CCD camera. The GABAA receptor agonist
muscimol was applied using a puff electrode placed near the recorded neuron, in the presence of TTX to block action potential
activity. Brief puffs of muscimol reliably evoked Ca 2ϩ responses
in TRN neuron dendrites (Fig. 5C). Bath application of TTA-P2
(1 ␮M) largely eliminated muscimol-evoked Ca 2ϩ transients
(Fig. 5C,D) while having only a modest influence on the
muscimol-evoked depolarization. Thus, Ca 2ϩ influx evoked by
GABAA receptor activation is primarily mediated by activation of
T-type Ca 2ϩ channels.
Feedforward inhibition induced by excitatory GABAergic
intra-TRN synapses
Neurons of the TRN provide powerful inhibitory connections to
thalamic relay cells (Jones, 2007). We examined the impact of
GABA-evoked burst firing in TRN neurons on the dynamics of
inhibitory inputs received by relay neurons in the ventrobasal
nucleus of the thalamus (VB). We recorded from VB neurons in
whole-cell voltage clamp (0 mV holding potential), with excitatory neurotransmission blocked pharmacologically. Single
stimuli applied to TRN led to two distinct types of inhibitory
responses in VB neurons: short-latency monophasic IPSCs with
little latency jitter from trial to trial, and long-latency multiphasic
IPSCs with pronounced latency jitter between trials (Fig.
6 A, C,E). Both responses were blocked by the GABAA receptor
antagonist gabazine (10 ␮M) (Fig. 6G). As VB does not contain
local GABAergic interneurons and receives inhibitory input exclusively from the TRN, both types of responses must have orig-

inated in the TRN. Based on the findings described above, we
hypothesized that long-latency responses are disynaptic, mediated by stimulus-evoked bursts of action potentials in TRN neurons, which then generate feedforward inhibition in relay
neurons. By contrast, short-latency responses are evoked by direct activation of axons formed by TRN neurons targeting VB
cells (Fig. 6 H). To test this idea, we applied low concentrations of
the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine (0.2 ␮M), which on average reduced the amplitude of the short-latency response by
53.5 Ϯ 1.7% (n ϭ 5) (Fig. 6 A, B,G). By contrast, long-latency
responses were completely eliminated, consistent with the idea
that attenuated GABAA receptor-mediated depolarizations no
longer triggered action potentials in TRN neurons. Similarly, reducing release probability at TRN GABAergic terminals should
have similar effects on the short- and long-latency responses.
Indeed, we found that reducing transmitter release by bath application of the CB1 receptor agonist WIN55,212 (5 ␮M) led to a
differential reduction of short- and long-latency amplitude (Fig.
6C, D, G), consistent with a block of GABA-induced bursting in
the TRN (Fig. 1C,D) and a more moderate reduction in transmitter release at GABAergic synapses in VB (Sun et al., 2011).

postsynaptic membrane depolarization is not significantly reduced by TTA-P2. Error bars indicate SEM.

As demonstrated above (Fig. 4), GABA-triggered burst firing
in TRN neurons is dependent on activation of dendritic T-type
Ca 2ϩ channels. If long-latency multiphasic IPSCs in VB neurons
are evoked by GABA-triggered bursts of action potentials in TRN
neurons, they should be eliminated by the T-type Ca 2ϩ channel
blocker TTA-P2. Indeed, bath application of TTA-P2 (1 ␮M)
completely eliminated long-latency responses (Fig. 6 E–G), confirming that T-type Ca 2ϩ channels are critical for GABA-evoked
TRN burst firing and the generation of disynaptic inhibition in
VB neurons, By contrast, short-latency IPSCs were unaffected by
TTA-P2 (Fig. 6 E–G), confirming that T-type Ca 2ϩ channels are
not involved in regulating transmitter release at GABAergic terminals in either TRN (Fig. 4 E, F ) or VB. Thus, depolarizing intraTRN GABAergic synapses can generate long-latency multiphasic
IPSCs in the VB neurons by recruiting local TRN neurons.

Discussion
Here, we have shown that intra-TRN GABAergic synapses, acting
via GABAA receptors, depolarize postsynaptic TRN neurons. We
found that TRN neurons maintain high [Cl Ϫ]i, resulting in a ECl
of approximately Ϫ45 mV. High [Cl Ϫ]i is generally associated
with low KCC2 expression in the plasma membrane (Rivera et al.,
1999). In agreement, we found that KCC2 is only weakly expressed in the TRN, whereas relay neurons in the adjacent somatosensory thalamus showed strong expression. Intra-TRN
synaptic activity was sufficient to trigger action potentials when
TRN neurons were in burst mode, mediated by the activation of
T-type Ca 2ϩ channels.

chrony (Beenhakker and Huguenard, 2009) or mediating
attentional processes (Crick, 1984), important questions remain
about their anatomical and physiological properties. Previous
work examining the impact of intra-TRN GABAergic synapses
on their postsynaptic target has led to conflicting results. Bath
application of GABAA receptor agonists can depolarize TRN neurons (Spreafico et al., 1988). Similarly, in vivo work in anesthe-

Sun et al. • GABA-Triggered Activity

tized cats has shown burst firing in TRN neurons, evoked by
depolarizing GABAergic inputs (Bazhenov et al., 1999). In contrast, many studies have concluded that intra-TRN synapses are
either shunting or hyperpolarizing from rest (Ahlse´n and Lindstro¨m, 1982; Sanchez-Vives et al., 1997; Ulrich and Huguenard,
1997; Shu and McCormick, 2002). However, almost all experimental evidence has relied on intracellular recording techniques,
which alter the intracellular milieu and introduce unknown measurement errors of the membrane potential (Verheugen et al.,
1999).
By using both cell-attached and perforated-patch recording
techniques at near-physiological temperatures, we conclude that
GABAA receptor-mediated postsynaptic responses are depolarizing from rest. Furthermore, our immunohistochemical data indicate that TRN neurons express extremely low levels of KCC2, in
contrast to the strong expression found in relay neurons of the
adjacent thalamic nuclei. Similar nucleus-specific expression of
KCC2 was previously shown in adult rats (Bartho´ et al., 2004).
These data provide independent evidence for a high [Cl Ϫ]i in
TRN neurons, suggesting that our electrophysiological data are
not the result of a slicing-induced change in Cl Ϫ regulation.
Our experimentally determined value for ECl in TRN neurons
(Ϫ45 mV) is significantly more depolarized compared with the
value of Ϫ70 mV reported in a previous study (Ulrich and Huguenard, 1997). While using similar techniques, Ulrich and Huguenard (1997) performed their study at room temperature,
whereas our experiments were performed at near-physiological
temperatures. It is possible that intracellular chloride levels in
TRN neurons are strongly temperature dependent, particularly
since increases in temperature appear to reduce KCC2 activity,
while NKCC1 and -2 activity is increased (Hartmann and Nothwang, 2011). While repeated agonist applications could have influenced ECl as measured under our experimental conditions
(Huguenard and Alger, 1986), we want to emphasize that GABAA
receptor-evoked depolarizations and spikes were observed following single GABAergic synaptic inputs, which are unlikely to
lead to increases in [Cl Ϫ]i.
An excitatory role of GABA in TRN neurons is consistent with
a growing list of studies suggesting that GABA, by activating
ionotropic GABAA receptors, can depolarize distinct neuronal
compartments in neurons of the mature or near-mature brain.
GABA-induced depolarizations and Ca 2ϩ increases can facilitate
transmitter release and increase cell excitability (Price and Trussell, 2006; Stell et al., 2007; Pugh and Jahr, 2011) or facilitate
action potential generation under certain conditions (Wagner et
al., 1997; Chavas and Marty, 2003; Gulledge and Stuart, 2003;
Chiang et al., 2012; Haam et al., 2012). Only a small number of
studies have demonstrated that GABA release from interneurons
alone can trigger action potentials from resting membrane potential levels (Szabadics et al., 2006; Woodruff et al., 2006), and
the evidence is indirect and controversial (Glickfeld et al., 2009).
Our study provides direct evidence that single GABAergic synaptic inputs are sufficient to trigger action potentials.
Amplification of excitatory GABAergic synaptic transmission
by T-type Ca 2؉ channels
Our electrophysiological and imaging data show that activation
of GABAA receptors leads to the opening of dendritic T-type
Ca 2ϩ channels in TRN neurons, thereby amplifying GABAevoked postsynaptic depolarizations. This extends previous work
suggesting that subthreshold glutamatergic EPSPs can be enhanced by the activation of T-type Ca 2ϩ channels (Magee et al.,
1995; Gillessen and Alzheimer, 1997; Urban et al., 1998; Crandall

Sun et al. • GABA-Triggered Activity

et al., 2010). Importantly, we find that the activation of T-type
Ca 2ϩ channels is essential for GABA-triggered spike generation.
When T-type Ca 2ϩ channels were either blocked pharmacologically or inactivated following depolarization of the postsynaptic
membrane, GABAergic synaptic inputs no longer triggered action potentials, indicating that ECl is below the threshold for
Na ϩ-dependent action potentials.
The lack of selective antagonists has long made it challenging
to assign computational roles to specific types of voltage-gated
Ca 2ϩ channels. A case in point is the role of T-type conductances
in TRN neurons. Previous work has suggested that these conductances allow for rhythmic bursting typical for non-rapid eye
movement sleep (Contreras, 2006; Cueni et al., 2008). However,
supporting evidence was often based on pharmacological block
of T-type Ca 2ϩ channels using mibefradil, a drug that also interacts with Na ϩ channels and, in addition, blocks R-type (Cav2.3)
Ca 2ϩ channels (Randall and Tsien, 1997), which are expressed in
TRN neurons (Zaman et al., 2011). In fact, recent studies in mice
lacking Cav2.3 have demonstrated that R-type Ca 2ϩ channels are
critical for oscillatory burst discharges (Zaman et al., 2011), further questioning an exclusive role of T-type conductances in mediating rhythmic burst firing. Using the selective antagonist TTA-P2
(Dreyfus et al., 2010), which has only negligible effects on R-type
conductances at the concentration used in our study (Choe et al.,
2011), we directly demonstrate that the amplification of GABAtriggered postsynaptic responses is mediated by dendritic T-type
Ca 2ϩ channels. Interestingly, T-type Ca 2ϩ channels are tightly associated with Ca 2ϩ-dependent small-conductance (SK)-type K ϩ
channels in TRN dendrites (Cueni et al., 2008). Therefore, the dendritic amplification of subthreshold glutamatergic and GABAergic
synaptic inputs is likely controlled by a dynamic interplay of voltageand Ca 2ϩ-gated conductances.
Functional role of intra-TRN GABAergic synapses
TRN is crucially involved in the generation of rhythmic activity in
the thalamocortical system (McCormick and Bal, 1997). Neurons
in the TRN send powerful inhibitory inputs to excitatory thalamic relay cells, which in turn form excitatory inputs onto TRN
neurons. This reciprocally connected TRN–relay cell circuit mediates synchronous oscillations (e.g., during sleep spindles). Importantly, individual pairs of TRN and relay neurons do not form
reciprocal connections (Pinault, 2004) and connectivity between
relay neurons is virtually nonexistent. Thus, it is possible that
depolarizing GABAergic synapses, along with electrical synapses
(Landisman et al., 2002), form a critical substrate for the initiation of synchronous oscillations in the thalamus. This is consistent with modeling (Bazhenov et al., 1999) and experimental
(Steriade et al., 1987) studies suggesting that the isolated TRN
nucleus can generate rhythmic oscillations.
However, the functional impact of intra-TRN GABAergic
synapses is likely to be complex and strongly dependent on the
context of their activation (Marty and Llano, 2005). Since ECl is
depolarized compared with the resting membrane potential but
more hyperpolarized compared with spike threshold, subthreshold GABAergic inputs will likely act as a shunt for glutamatergic
inputs that coincide with the opening of the GABAA receptormediated chloride conductance, while being excitatory following
the closing of the chloride conductance, similar to what was observed for GABAergic inputs in neocortical pyramidal neurons
(Gulledge and Stuart, 2003). More sustained activation of
GABAergic synapses will tend to clamp the membrane potential
near the equilibrium potential for Cl Ϫ, shunting excitatory synaptic inputs and in addition, leading to inactivation of T-type

J. Neurosci., June 6, 2012 • 32(23):7782–7790 • 7789

Ca 2ϩ channels. Thus, intra-TRN GABAergic synapses are most
likely inhibitory during more sustained levels of synaptic and
neuronal activity, consistent with a role of preventing pathological forms of hypersynchrony in thalamic circuits (Huntsman et
al., 1999).
GABAergic synapses between TRN neurons could also form
an important substrate for the rapid interaction between distinct
thalamic nuclei. TRN is composed of multiple sectors, each of
which primarily serves an individual sensory, motor, or limbic
modality (Pinault, 2004). Work in vitro has shown that activity in
one thalamic nucleus can lead to inhibition in a functionally
distinct thalamic nucleus (Crabtree et al., 1998; Crabtree and
Isaac, 2002). As thalamic nuclei do not form functional connections with each other, such cross-modal actions are likely mediated by a synaptic pathway passing through the TRN. Therefore,
local circuits of synaptically connected TRN neurons might allow
TRN to select appropriate intrathalamic pathways for distinct
sensory, motor, and cognitive tasks and could mediate crossmodal modulation of TRN neurons during attentional processes
(Yu et al., 2009).

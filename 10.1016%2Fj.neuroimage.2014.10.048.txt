In humans, the knowledge of intracranial correlates of spindles is mainly gathered from noninvasive neurophysiologic and functional imaging studies which provide an indirect estimate of neuronal intracranial activity. This
potential limitation can be overcome by intracranial electroencephalography used in presurgical epilepsy evaluation. We investigated the intracranial correlates of scalp spindles using combined scalp and intracerebral depth
electrodes covering the frontal, parietal and temporal neocortex, and the scalp and intracranial correlates of hippocampal and insula spindles in 35 pre-surgical epilepsy patients. Spindles in the scalp were accompanied by
widespread cortical increases in sigma band energy (10–16 Hz): the highest percentages were observed in the
frontoparietal lateral and mesial cortex, whereas in temporal lateral and mesial structures only a low or no simultaneous increase was present. This intracranial involvement during scalp spindles showed no consistent pattern,
and exhibited unexpectedly low synchrony across brain regions. Hippocampal spindles were shorter and spatially restricted with a low synchrony even within the temporal lobe. Similar results were found for the insula. We
suggest that the generation of spindles is under a high local cortical inﬂuence contributing to the concept of sleep
as a local phenomenon and challenging the notion of spindles as widespread synchronous oscillations.

Introduction
Spindles are distinct electroencephalographic (EEG) events which
are the hallmark of non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 2. They are
characterized by waxing and waning oscillations with a frequency
between 10 and 16 Hz and duration between 0.5 and 2 s (Loomis
et al., 1935; Gibbs and Gibbs, 1950; Jankel and Niedermeyer, 1985).
Recent research points to the importance of spindles for memory consolidation, cortical development, and sleep stability (Khazipov et al., 2004;
Schabus et al., 2004; Dang-Vu et al., 2010a; Fogel and Smith, 2011).
The “classical” thalamic model of spindle generation suggests that
spindles are generated in the reticular thalamic nucleus, triggered by
the depolarizing phase of the cortical slow oscillation via corticothalamic
pathways. After being transferred to the dorsal thalamus, they project
back to the cortex following thalamo-cortical circuits (Fuentealba and
Steriade, 2005; Steriade, 2006). In humans, knowledge on spindles and
their source localization is gathered from EEG (Anderer et al., 2001;
Kurth et al., 2010; del Felice et al., 2013), magnetoencephalography
(MEG) (Nakasato et al., 1990; Manshanden et al., 2002; Ishii et al.,

and functional imaging studies with positron emission tomography
and functional magnetic resonance imaging (Hoﬂe et al., 1997; Laufs
et al., 2007; Schabus et al., 2007; Tyvaert et al., 2008; Andrade et al.,
2011; Caporro et al., 2012). These studies demonstrate that there are at
least two different cortical spindle generators with a maximal source activity in the frontal and parietal neocortex (Anderer et al., 2001;
Gumenyuk et al., 2009). In addition, functional imaging studies revealed
that at the time of scalp spindles, a signal change is present in the frontal
and parietal cortex, and in the thalamus, limbic regions, precuneus and
cingulate gyrus, which would be compatible with the suggested gating
sensory function of spindles and their involvement in memory and
learning (Dang-Vu et al., 2010b). The results of source localization with
EEG and MEG are highly dependent on the algorithms used for solving
the inverse problem, whereas functional imaging studies provide an indirect estimate of neuronal activity with a poor time resolution as they
primarily target hemodynamic changes.
These limitations can be overcome by intracranial EEG used in the
setting of the presurgical investigation of therapy-refractory epilepsy.
Only two studies looked at characteristics of spindles in a small number
of subjects and over different brain regions using intracerebral depth
electrodes (Andrillon et al., 2011; Peter-Derex et al., 2012). Their
major ﬁndings were that spindles occur across multiple brain regions,
that spindle frequencies change along a caudo-rostral axis with faster

spindles found in the centroparietal areas and slower spindles in the
frontal regions and that 55% of spindles are more local than generalized
when looking at overlapping activity in the spindle frequency band in
different intracranial EEG channels (Andrillon et al., 2011; Peter-Derex
et al., 2012). Because scalp EEG was not simultaneously analyzed during
these intracerebral EEG studies, they do not inform us about what
happens in different brain regions when a spindle is recorded on the
scalp. This is of great interest as it provides us with direct information
of intracerebral correlates of scalp spindles, and allows us to investigate
synchronization between scalp spindle events and intracerebral spindles. Recent studies using simultaneous EEG/MEG revealed that MEG
spindles have low spatial coherence and exhibit low correlation with
EEG spindles (Dehghani et al., 2011). The authors speculated that multiple asynchronous sources as revealed by MEG may overlap sufﬁciently
to appear synchronously in the EEG (Dehghani et al., 2011). This is still
an object of controversy and can be addressed with combined scalp and
intracranial EEG. We therefore investigated the intracranial correlates of
scalp spindles using combined scalp–intracranial EEG. Special attention
was paid to the analysis of synchrony of intracranial spindles at the time
of scalp spindles. In addition, we were interested to examine the scalp
correlates of spindles in the hippocampus and insula as examples of
brain structures remote from the scalp.
Material and methods
Patient selection
Forty-nine consecutive patients with pharmacoresistant temporal or
extra-temporal lobe epilepsy underwent continuous intracranial EEG
recordings combined with scalp EEG at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital between January 2010 and February 2014 for seizure
foci identiﬁcation and potential surgical treatment.
We included patients for whom we had at least one continuous
whole night recording which was at least 72 h post-electrode implantation in order to avoid a potential inﬂuence of anesthesia on sleep as well
as the acute effect of electrode implantation. Also, to be as close as possible to the study of sleep in healthy subjects, we selected brain regions
and periods of recording that were as little as possible affected by the epileptic activity always recorded in these patients. Hence, a second inclusion criterion was that patients' recordings had at least one intracranial
EEG channel with no or very rare epileptic discharges and no other abnormalities, and that these channels were not within lesional tissue as
assessed with MRI (see “Selection of suitable intracranial EEG channels”
section). Thirdly, we only included subjects in whom epileptic activity
did not interfere with spindle scoring and who had at least 5 unambiguous spindles in the scalp EEG during the ﬁrst sleep cycle. Choosing a different cut-off of for instance 10 spindles would have resulted in the same
number of eligible EEG recordings. In fact, only 3 patients had fewer than
50 spindles in the ﬁrst sleep cycle with a minimum number of 31 spindles (see Supplementary Table 1). The spindle events were marked during the ﬁrst sleep cycle in order to follow the same methodology in all
subjects, as density of slow wave activity changes across the different
sleep cycles, and there is evidence (Andrillon et al., 2011) that spindle
density and frequency are inﬂuenced by this change in slow wave activity. Exclusion criteria were the presence of a secondarily generalized seizure during the 12 h, or the presence of a partial seizure or asymptomatic
EEG seizure during the 6 h prior to the evaluated night of the sleep.
Thirty-ﬁve of the 49 patients met these selection criteria. Demographic and clinical data are provided in Supplementary Table 1.
Reasons for exclusion were: recordings having no channels with no or
rare epileptic discharges (n = 4), no channels located outside lesional
tissue (n = 2), lack of at least ﬁve unambiguous spindle events in the
ﬁrst sleep cycle (n = 2), presence of partial or asymptomatic EEG seizures within 6 h or generalized seizures within 12 h of sleep recordings
(n = 4), absence of a sleep recording 72 h post-implantation (n = 1), or
the presence of epileptic discharges in the scalp EEG channels

interfering with the scoring of sleep spindles (n = 1). In patients with
several full-night recordings, the ﬁrst night after 72 h post-implantation
was evaluated.
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the
Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital. All patients signed a
Research Ethics Board approved written informed consent.
Intracranial and scalp EEG recording
An average of seven multicontact depth electrodes (range, 4–12)
was implanted stereotactically through an orthogonal or oblique approach using an image-guided system (ROSA robotic neuronavigation
system or Medtronic Stealth neuronavigation system). In 21 patients,
implantations consisted of electrodes manufactured on site (9 contacts,
0.5 to 1 mm in length and 5 mm apart); and in 14 patients, commercially available electrodes (DIXI Medical, France: 10 to 18 contacts, 2 mm in
length and 1.5 mm apart) were used. The deepest contacts were
targeting the mesial aspect of the lobe explored, and the most superﬁcial ones were targeting the neocortex. The depth electrode montages
were bipolar, from one contact to the neighboring contact. Epidural
electrodes were additionally placed in eight patients. Electrode locations were determined by either post-implantation CT co-registered
with a pre-implantation MRI using SPM 8 software (n = 15), postimplantation MRI (n = 14), or the information from the reconstructed
planned position of the electrodes from the Neuronavigation System
(n = 6). Subdermal thin wire electrodes (Ives, 2005; Young et al.,
2006) were placed at the time of implantation at positions F3, F4, Fz,
C3, C4, Cz, P3, P4, Pz (33 patients) or Fz, C3, C4, Cz, Pz (2 patients)
allowing for sleep staging and spindle marking. Intracerebral electrode
positions were tailored for each patient and depended on the clinical
hypothesis on the location of the seizure generator and propagation of
ictal discharge. Fig. 1 provides an overview of the number of channels
investigated in the different cortical regions. Information on the localization of the electrode contacts of each patient is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. The EEG signal was low-pass ﬁltered at 500 Hz, and
sampled at 2000 Hz. EEGs were recorded using the Harmonie EEG system (Stellate, Montreal, Canada).
Selection of suitable intracranial EEG channels
Only bipolar intracranial channels showing no or very rare epileptic
discharges as well as no other background abnormalities and artifacts
were evaluated. Suitable channels were selected based on the ﬁrst
sleep cycle independently by two electrophysiologists. For channels for
which the selection differed between the two raters, a consensus was
found in a common scoring session. Ambiguous channels were discarded
as we aimed to investigate physiological sleep patterns. Moreover, depth
electrodes placed in lesions as revealed by MRI were excluded irrespective
of whether they showed interictal epileptic discharges.
Assessment of spindles in scalp EEG recordings
Sleep was scored manually in 30 s epochs (Berry et al., 2012). The
identiﬁcation of spindles was done visually by a sleep expert, as it presents the generally accepted approach to reliably mark scalp spindles,
and the number of needed events is still reasonable for a visual
approach (Warby et al., 2014). Spindles were identiﬁed during the
ﬁrst NREM sleep cycle by using a time scale of 30 mm/s in all scalp
EEG channels (F3–C3, C3–P3, Fz–Cz, Cz–Pz, F4–C4, C4–P4). We did not
use a traditional mastoid referential montage for the scoring of sleep,
as this was not feasible for all patients due to the localization of the implanted depth electrodes and the risk of infection. Conventional sleep
recording with the same electrodes using a bipolar and mastoid reference montage revealed in line with the existing literature (Werth
et al., 1997) that most spindles seen in the bipolar montage can be

area of the circles is proportional to the number of investigated channels in each brain structure, and the color indicates the percentage of channels in which a statistically signiﬁcant increase in sigma band energy (10–16 Hz) was observed during the scalp spindle intervals compared to the control intervals (with Holm–Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons).

also seen in a mastoid referential montage, usually with a 0.5 or 1 cycle
difference in the onset of the spindle.
Spindle identiﬁcation stopped after 50 spindles were marked, or
after all available spindles were marked in the ﬁrst sleep cycle in case
there were fewer than 50. Spindles were deﬁned according to their
typical waxing and waning morphology, their frequency between 10
and 16 Hz and duration of at least 0.5 s. No ﬁlters were set for spindle
detection and gain was adapted as best suitable. For each spindle, the
peak of the ﬁrst well-deﬁned negative wave was marked using a
band-pass ﬁlter between 5 and 20 Hz. In case of simultaneous spindles
over different channels, the spindle with the highest amplitude was
marked. For statistical analysis, for each spindle a non-spindle control
segment lasting 1 s was selected automatically and manually checked
in the same channel at a random interval of 5 to 6 s after the onset of
the corresponding spindle. If the control segment overlapped another
spindle, it was displaced to the closest spindle-free section.
Assessment of spindles in hippocampus and insula
We also investigated the presence of sleep spindles in the hippocampus and insula as examples of brain regions remote from the scalp. The
same methodology concerning spindle identiﬁcation and choice of a
non-spindle control interval was applied as for the scalp. The channels
assessed for spindle analysis were selected based on their location and
deﬁned by post-implantation imaging. All channels in the hippocampus
were analyzed as one group, and as for the scalp the onset of the spindle
with the highest amplitude was marked. The same procedure was
applied to the insula channels. The target number of spindles was, as
for the scalp, either 50 or all available spindles in the ﬁrst sleep cycle if
there were fewer than 50.
Data processing
For the analysis, we selected only the most medial and the most lateral
bipolar channels of each electrode which were in the cerebral cortex as
assessed via post-implantation imaging or reconstructed planned position
of the electrodes (e.g. in case of an electrode with 9 contacts, contacts 1–2
and contacts 8–9 were evaluated if they were in the gray matter and showed
no abnormal activity or artifacts). The recordings were made with a 2 kHz
sampling rate, and the ﬁrst data processing step was a down-sampling to
100 Hz (antialiasing zero phase FIR ﬁlter of order 160, cutoff frequency
25 Hz). All data processing was performed with Matlab R 2007b.
To decide which channels presented a change in the sigma band
activity (10–16 Hz) at the same time as the marked scalp spindles, we
tested whether the energy in the sigma band was the same in the spindle and control segments for each channel. First, the signal component
in the sigma band was obtained, using a zero-phase FIR ﬁlter (order
160, 2 Hz transition bands, 70 dB attenuation on the low frequency
stop-band and 50 dB on the high frequency stop band, 0.4% ripple in

the pass band). From the ﬁltered signal we computed the energy in
the sigma band in each one second interval starting at the onset of the
spindles and control epochs. The choice of the length of the epochs is
somewhat arbitrary since spindle durations can vary. However,
attempts to determine the duration of the spindles, visually or automatically, would also include arbitrary thresholds for the power or amplitude of the signal. A ﬁxed duration has the advantage of easy
reproducibility and this was the reason for our choice. The energy values
from the epochs were log-transformed and a paired t-test was carried
out for each channel. We adopted a signiﬁcance level of p = 0.05,
with a Holm–Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons, considering the number of comparisons equal to the total number
of channels. We also report the results with Holm–Bonferroni correction
per region (i.e. considering the number of comparisons equal to the
number of channels per region), and the uncorrected test results to
illustrate the robustness of the data.
To determine the frequency of the spindles, we estimated their
power spectral density (PSD). We deﬁned the spindle frequency as
the frequency at which the PSD attains a maximum in the sigma band.
The spectrum of the spindle segments was computed in every channel.
The squared magnitude of the Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DFT)
was computed for segments of 1 s starting at the onset of each marked
scalp spindle. Then, the DFT was averaged among all the spindles of
each channel, to obtain the PSD.
The variation in time of the energy in the sigma band during spindles
was analyzed in the different brain regions of interest. The time course
of the energy content was computed in each channel with a zerophase moving average FIR ﬁlter (length 0.25 s) applied to the squared
amplitude of the signal in the sigma band. The averaged energy signal
was obtained for the spindle intervals, and divided by the average signal
in the control intervals. A single energy signal was obtained for each
brain region by averaging the channels from the different patients.
To analyze the degree of synchrony between the scalp and intracranial EEG signals, we computed the cross-correlation. For each scalp
spindle and control segment, we computed the normalized crosscorrelation of the sigma band component of the signal in the scalp channel in which the event was marked and of all analyzed intracranial
channels. The normalized cross correlation function was computed for
a segment of 0.5 s starting at the onset of the marked events. The normalized cross-correlation at zero delay, i.e. the correlation coefﬁcient,
and the maximum of the cross-correlation function were recorded for
each event. The allowed delay was chosen to maximize the separability between the spindle and control segments, computed as the proportion of
correctly classiﬁed segments by a threshold in the correlation values. The
threshold was varied to ﬁnd an optimum value for each maximum delay.
The maximum of the normalized cross-correlation function depends
on the shape of the envelope of the signals, but there could be a phase
synchrony between the signals independently of their envelope. Therefore, the synchrony was also studied by analyzing the distribution of the

4

local minima in the signals in an interval of ±50 ms around the spindle
onset. This onset was marked at a negative peak of the scalp signal.
Then, channels in which a local minimum (negative peak) of the
sigma band component is consistently found at a given delay with
respect to the spindle onset will show a peak in the distribution of the
delays. If the delay is not consistent among the different spindles, the
distribution of the delays will be uniform, with no clear peak. We compare the distribution of the local minima in each channel to a uniform
distribution with a non-parametric Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodnessof-ﬁt hypothesis test, with a 5% signiﬁcance level.
The same analysis was carried out for the spindles marked on intracranial channels in the hippocampus and insula.
The temporal coupling between neocortical spindles and hippocampal
ripples has been hypothesized to serve a hippocampo-neocortical
dialogue underlying memory consolidation during sleep (Siapas and
Wilson, 1998; Clemens et al., 2007, 2011). To study the connection between scalp spindles and physiological ripples in the hippocampus, we
looked for differences in the ripple band (80–250 Hz) energy in hippocampal channels during scalp spindles. The ripple band component of
hippocampal channels was obtained with a zero-phase band-pass FIR ﬁlter (80–250 Hz, transition bands of width 10 Hz, 60 dB attenuation in the
low frequency stop-band and 40 dB attenuation in the high frequency
stop-band). Then, a paired t-test comparing the ripple band energy during
scalp spindle and control intervals was performed. The same analysis was
repeated including only fast scalp spindles with a frequency higher than
13 Hz, as fast centroparietal spindles are thought to be related to memory
formation in contrast to more unspeciﬁc slow frontal spindles (Schabus
et al., 2007). This analysis was repeated for hippocampal spindles.

Results
Distribution of evaluated intracranial EEG channels
In the 35 patients, we retained 280 intracranial EEG channels following the exclusion criteria indicated above. A median of 50 spindles
(range, 31–50) in the scalp was analyzed. The median spindle rate
was 4.0/min (range, 0.6–10). The frontal, parietal and temporal lobes
were well sampled with ≥10 EEG channels per region. For detailed information on the sampled anatomical localizations see Fig. 1, Table 1,
and Supplementary Fig. 1.

Intracranial sigma energy at time of scalp spindles
Table 1 provides the percentages of channels with signiﬁcant increase in sigma band energy at the time of scalp spindles compared to
control intervals over the investigated brain regions. For this dataset,
the Holm–Bonferroni correction for the 280 channel comparisons indicated an uncorrected p-value of 2.7 × 10−4 for 5% signiﬁcance. Sigma
energy increased not only in the frontal and parietal neocortical lateral
convexities, but also in remote areas such as the mesial frontal and parietal structures. The percentage of channels with a signiﬁcant increase
in sigma energy ranged between 25.0 and 80.8%. The sigma energy difference was between 1.6 and 4.6 dB. In contrast in the temporal neocortex only a low percentage of channels with a signiﬁcant sigma energy
increase was found (maximum 12.5%, maximum sigma energy difference of 0.8 dB), and there was no signiﬁcant increase in the temporal
limbic structures. The percentage of signiﬁcant increase in sigma band
energy in the insula channels showed an intermediate level of 25.0%
with a sigma energy difference of 2.0 dB. We found no signiﬁcant difference (unpaired t-test, p = 0.56) in the average sigma energy increase
between the intracranial channels in the left (161 channels) and right
(119 channels) hemispheres. A grouping of the scalp spindles in
fronto-central, centro-parietal, and widespread spindles was performed
(widespread if increase in sigma energy during the spindle was at least
6 dB in both regions, otherwise the region is determined by the largest
increase in sigma energy when comparing fronto-central and centroparietal channels). The mean intracranial sigma energy increase for
the 570 (33.7%) widespread spindles was 3.6 dB, 1.3 dB for the 773
(45.7%) fronto-central spindles, and 1.1 dB for the 348 (20.6%) centroparietal spindles.
The frequencies of peak sigma energy in the intracranial EEG at the
time of scalp spindles followed a caudo-rostral gradient, with faster frequencies in the centro-parietal regions and slower frequencies in the
frontal regions (Table 1).
Fig. 2 shows the changes over time of the sigma energy compared to
the control intervals. Time zero corresponds to the onset of the spindles
in the scalp. The maximum energy in the marked spindles was on average 9.5 dB (9 times) higher than in the control intervals, and occurred
0.30 s after onset. As expected, the brain regions with higher percentages of channels showing signiﬁcant increases in sigma energy in
Table 1 also expressed higher energy in Fig. 2. The energy in most of
the regions peaked at approximately the same time as the scalp energy,

except that the prefrontal region (Fig. 2b) and the anterior cingulate

To determine if the described average behavior corresponds to a
consistent pattern for individual spindles, in Fig. 3 we show the increase
in sigma energy of every individual spindle for each of the 280 intracranial channels. Each row in the matrix depicted in Fig. 3 corresponds to a
channel and each column to a scalp spindle. The color level indicates the
change in sigma energy of each spindle interval of 1 s compared to the
corresponding control intervals. These are the values used for the

channel and each column to a single scalp spindle. The channels are sorted according to
the p-value in a paired t-test comparing the sigma band energy in the spindle and control
intervals. The white spaces correspond to channels of subjects with fewer than 50 marked
scalp spindles. Channels show a large variability in sigma band energy increase at the time
of different scalp spindles. More signiﬁcant channels are more likely to exhibit an increase
in the sigma band energy, but such increases are also seen occasionally on non-signiﬁcant
channels.

hypothesis test reported in Table 1, and the channels are sorted according to p-value. In any single channel there was a large variability among
the different spindle intervals: channels with lower p-values correspond to a higher probability of sigma energy increase, but there is no
clear stable pattern. In some intervals we found a decrease in sigma energy, which can be explained by the presence of spindles in intracranial
channels during the spindle-free control intervals in the scalp EEG (4%
of the total number of intervals showed a decrease of sigma band energy
below −6 dB, and these intervals had on average a 6 dB increase in the
energy during the control interval, compared to the rest of the control
intervals). We conclude that the spatial distribution of increases in
sigma energy is highly variable from spindle to spindle.
We also studied the degree of synchrony between the scalp spindles
and the intracranial sigma activity. Fig. 4a shows a histogram of the correlation coefﬁcient between scalp spindles and intracranial sigma
activity. The proportion of cross-correlation coefﬁcients in different
range bins is shown for the control intervals and for the time of scalp
spindles; the latter is divided into the intracranial channels not showing
a signiﬁcant increase in sigma energy at the time of scalp spindles
(p N 0.05) and the ones showing a signiﬁcant increase (p b 0.05). The
cross-correlation coefﬁcients for the control intervals and the nonsigniﬁcant channels had an almost equal distribution, while the channels with a signiﬁcant energy increase had slightly higher correlation
coefﬁcients. However, the proportion of cases with high correlation
coefﬁcients was low in the channels with signiﬁcant sigma power
increases, the channels with no signiﬁcant sigma power increases, and
the control intervals, indicating a poor synchrony between intracranial
sites and scalp EEG. If a delay was allowed between scalp and intracranial signals, the maximum values of the cross-correlations were higher
as seen in Fig. 4b, but the differences between the signiﬁcant channels
and the control intervals or the non-signiﬁcant channels were still
low, even when choosing a maximum delay of 28 ms, which maximized
the separability of the spindle and control segments.
A high maximum absolute value of the normalized correlation function indicates that the signals in the intracranial and scalp channels are
similar except for a delay. However, the cross-correlation results do not

indicate if the delay is always the same for different spindles in any
given intracranial channel. To determine if there is a consistent delay,
we looked for local minima in the sigma band component of the signals.
For each channel we counted the number of local minima in 2 ms intervals, accumulated for all spindle intervals. The results are shown in
Fig. 5. Each row in the matrix corresponds to a channel and each column
to a time bin relative to the marked spindle onset. The color level indicates the number of local minima in each bin. The results for the marked

for all the spindle intervals (50 spindle intervals in most cases). The top 35 rows correspond to the marked spindles, the middle rows to other scalp channels, and the bottom
half to the intracranial channels, sorted by p-value in the paired t-test comparing the
sigma band energy in the spindle and control intervals. Synchrony is consistently observed
in the scalp channels but not in the intracranial channels, indicating that for every spindle
the delay between scalp and intracranial channels is different.

was marked at the ﬁrst clear negative peak of the signal using a ﬁlter
with a pass band between 5 and 20 Hz, and as expected a very good synchrony is observed for the marked spindles. In most cases there is a local
minimum one wave length before the marked onset, although not a
clear one. As time passes, the synchrony decreases due to differences
in spindle frequencies and occurrence of spurious local minima. In the
middle section of the ﬁgure we see that the remaining scalp channels
also show a high degree of synchrony with the marked spindles. The
lower half corresponds to the 280 intracranial channels, again sorted according to the p-value in the sigma band energy test. No clear pattern is
seen in these channels, indicating that there was no consistent delay for
different spindles in any channel, and no clear similarities among channels. We performed a statistical test comparing the distribution of the
minima in a ±50 ms interval around the marked onsets to a uniform
distribution. At a 5% signiﬁcance level, we found evidence for rejecting
the hypothesis of uniformly distributed minima in 33 of the 35 (94%)
on the marked spindle sequences. In the 206 scalp channels, the distribution of the minima was signiﬁcantly different from a random distribution in 151 (73%) of the cases, but only in 10 of the 280 intracranial
channels (3.6%). In 6 of these 10 channels there was also signiﬁcant increase in sigma band energy in the spindle intervals (4 neocortical, 2 in
the cingulate gyrus). This means that even though in some channels
there was a frequent increase of sigma band energy at the same time
as the scalp spindles, the channels showing this increase and underlying
synchrony were not consistent. This is illustrated by four typical examples of individual scalp spindles of one patient in Fig. 6. We conclude
that there is very low synchrony between the scalp spindle and the
intracranial events, even if one introduces a delay; in addition, the
synchrony is highly variable from event to event.
To study the connection between scalp spindles and physiological
ripples in the hippocampus, we looked for differences in the ripple
band (80–250 Hz) energy in hippocampal channels during scalp spindles and the corresponding control non-spindle segments. The t-test
comparing ripple band energy in the hippocampal channels revealed
no evidence to reject the null hypothesis of equal energy (p = 0.09).
The same lack of evidence (p = 0.14) was obtained when only taking
into account the fast scalp spindles (spindles with a frequency N13 Hz).
In summary, we found an increase of the sigma activity in intracranial channels during scalp spindles. On average this increase was more
likely in some brain regions, but the involved channels varied in each

simultaneous, the phase synchronization of the waves was very poor,
and highly variable in each spindle.
Scalp and intracranial sigma energy at the time of hippocampal and insula
spindles
In this part of the project, we investigated the subgroups of the 35
patients who had normal hippocampal (n = 7) or insula (n = 8)
intracranial EEG channels.
Hippocampal spindles & sigma energy in scalp and intracranial EEG
At least 5 unambiguous spindles were found in six of the 7 patients
without abnormal hippocampal EEG activity (median, 31.5; range,
7–50). The median hippocampal spindle rate was 0.6/min (range,
0.1–6.7). A total of 70 intracranial EEG channels and 38 scalp EEG

channels were investigated for simultaneous sigma energy increase at
time of hippocampal spindles. The regions sampled with ≥5 channels
were the frontal lobe [prefrontal area, frontal neocortex (ﬁrst, second
and third frontal gyri), and anterior and midcingulate gyrus], the temporal lobe (temporal neocortex) and scalp (fronto-central, centroparietal). For this dataset an uncorrected p-value of 5.8 × 10−4
corresponded to 5% signiﬁcance according to the Holm–Bonferroni
correction for the 108 comparisons.
Table 2 shows the percentages of a simultaneous increase in sigma
energy in the non-hippocampal intracranial and scalp channels. At the
time of hippocampal spindles, 66.7% of temporo-mesial structures
showed an increase in sigma energy with a difference of 3 dB between
spindle and control segments. Further regions with moderate levels of
sigma energy increase between 25.0 and 42.9% were the temporal
neocortex, the frontolateral neocortex and precentral/central
regions, followed by the scalp between 18.8 and 22.7%. For all other

extratemporal channels the percentages of channels with an increase in
sigma energy at time of hippocampal spindles were comparatively low
(Table 2).
The time evolution of the average energy in the sigma band is shown
in Fig. 7. The maximum of the increase in sigma energy compared to
control intervals was similar to that in the scalp spindles, 10.5 dB or
11 times, but the hippocampal spindles were on average of much
shorter duration. The peak in sigma power occurred 130 ms after
onset, and the energy decreased rapidly. Given the lower number of
channels, the energy signals had more noise and usually showed several
peaks, but no brain region showed a change earlier than the hippocampus, and the energy increase in the parietal regions seemed delayed
with respect to the hippocampus. No synchrony was observed between
hippocampal spindles and sigma energy in other channels. A signiﬁcant
difference from a random distribution of the minima around the
marked onset was found only in one of the 38 (2.6%) scalp channels,
and in two of the 64 (3%) intracranial channels, but these channels did
not show a signiﬁcant increase in sigma energy during the spindle

intervals, suggesting that they may be false positives (compatible with
the 5% signiﬁcance level).
To study the connection between hippocampal spindles and physiological ripples in the hippocampus, we looked for differences in the
ripple band (80–250 Hz) energy in hippocampal channels during
hippocampal spindles and the corresponding control non-spindle segments. The t-test comparing ripple band energy in the hippocampal
channels revealed no evidence to reject the null hypothesis of equal
energy (p = 0.11). However, an increase of ripple band energy was
observed in 4 out of 6 patients. This increase was not enough to reach
statistical signiﬁcance given the low statistical power associated with
the limited number of healthy hippocampal channels in our dataset.
Insula spindles & sigma energy in scalp and intracranial EEG
At least 5 unambiguous spindles were found in seven of the 8
patients without abnormal insula EEG activity (median, 50; range,
26–50). The median insula spindle rate was 0.8/min (range, 0.5–4.5).
A total of 82 intracranial EEG channels and 42 scalp EEG channels

were investigated for a simultaneous increase in sigma energy at time of
insula spindles. The regions sampled with ≥5 channels were located in
the frontal lobe [frontal neocortex (ﬁrst, second and third frontal gyri),
precentral/central region, anterior and midcingulate gyrus and supplementary motor area], parietal lobe (superior and inferior parietal lobules), temporal lobe (temporal neocortex and temporo-mesial limbic
structures) and scalp (fronto-central, centro-parietal). Table 3 shows
the percentages of a simultaneous increase in sigma energy in the
non-insula intracranial and scalp EEG channels. For this dataset an uncorrected p-value of 7.1 × 10− 4 corresponded to 5% signiﬁcance
according to the Holm–Bonferroni correction for the 124 comparisons.
The highest percentages of channels with signiﬁcant increase in
sigma energy between 60.0 and 66.7% were found in the frontal lobe
(maximum sigma energy difference 4.7 dB) followed by the scalp (maximum 52.2%, maximum sigma energy difference 3.0 dB) and the parietal
lobules (maximum 33.3%, maximum sigma energy difference 2.0 dB).
Increases in sigma energy in the temporal lobe were scarce with a maximum of 20% in the temporo-lateral structures (sigma energy difference
1.0 dB).
We show the time evolution of the sigma energy in Fig. 8. The insula
spindles were of similar duration as the scalp spindles, with the peak in
energy 320 ms after onset, with a similar average energy increase compared to the control intervals, around 9.0 dB (8 times). The number of
channels was comparatively low and the resulting signals were noisy,
but the impression is that the increase in sigma energy occurs slightly
earlier in the parietal lobe channels, and slightly later in the prefrontal
region. The highest response in the supplementary motor area peaks
at approximately the same time.
Only one of 42 (2.4%) scalp channels showed evidence of a nonuniform distribution of the minima around the marked insula spindle
onset. More evidence of synchrony was found between insula spindles
and other intracranial channels, with evidence of non-uniform distribution of the minima in 12 of 64 channels, all of them also showing a
signiﬁcant increase of sigma energy. Eight of these channels were neocortical (6 frontal, 1 parietal, 1 temporal), and four were mesial frontal
(2 in the supplementary motor area, 1 prefrontal, and 1 in the cingulate
gyrus). This suggests some degree of synchrony between the insula and
other brain structures, although the statistical test only hints to some
degree of consistency in the delay between the spindle onset and the
closest minima in other channels. This does not imply that the actual
delay and spindle frequencies are the same between channels.
In summary, as in the case of scalp spindles, the most striking
characteristic of the correlates of hippocampal and insula spindles is
its lack of consistency among the individual events, showing variable
involvement and low synchrony of channels in other brain regions.
Discussion
This is the ﬁrst study to directly investigate intracranial correlates of
spindles in the surface EEG with combined scalp and intracranial EEG,

9

and the scalp correlates of spindles in the hippocampus and the insula
as examples of brain structures remote from the scalp. Major ﬁndings
are that spindles in the scalp are accompanied by widespread cortical
increases in sigma band energy (10–16 Hz) with highest percentages
of this increase in the frontoparietal lateral and mesial neocortex. The
intracranial involvement during scalp spindles showed no consistent
pattern, and exhibited unexpectedly low synchrony across brain
regions. In contrast to scalp spindles, hippocampal spindles were
shorter and more spatially restricted with low synchrony, even within
the temporal lobe. Similar results were found for the insula.
Widespread increase in intracranial sigma energy with scalp spindles
We found a widespread increase in intracranial sigma band energy
at the time of scalp spindles. This ﬁnding was not only evident over
the fronto-centro-parietal lateral neocortex, but also in more remote
brain areas such as the orbitofrontal region, the supplementary motor
area, the cingulate gyrus, and the pre-cuneus region. This widespread
distribution of energy in the sigma band at time of scalp spindles is
best explained by the widespread extent of thalamo-cortical projections
(Steriade, 2006). In contrast, the neocortical and mesiolimbic temporal
structures showed low or no signiﬁcant increase in sigma band energy
at the time of scalp spindles. This ﬁnding might follow the notion that
connections between the dorsal thalamic nuclei which project to the
mesiotemporal structures are not reciprocally connected with the reticular nucleus responsible for spindle generation, in contrast to thalamic
nuclei projecting to the frontal and parietal lobe structures. In addition,
the amygdala is sparsely connected to the thalamus (Jones, 2007). A low
increase of sigma activity in the temporal neocortex is more difﬁcult to
explain, as at least in the cat and rat, it is well connected with the
pulvinar nucleus which is reciprocally connected with the reticular
nucleus (Jones, 2007).
Several studies in humans demonstrated that spindles are widely
spread over different cortical areas with the lowest spindle rates seen
in the mesiolimbic temporal structures (Nakabayashi et al., 2001;
Nakamura et al., 2003; Andrillon et al., 2011; Peter-Derex et al., 2012).
Two groups found no neocortical temporal spindles (Nakabayashi
et al., 2001; Peter-Derex et al., 2012) but one group showed similar
spindle rates in the temporal as in the frontal and parietal neocortex
(Andrillon et al., 2011). Following a different approach, the present
study also demonstrated sigma activity increase in the temporal
neocortex, but only in a maximum of 12.5% of channels. Although
epochs with interictal epileptic discharges were discarded in the
previous studies, the evaluation of epileptic channels and the presence of a lesion may explain the difference observed in the results.
In the present study, we excluded all channels which had more
than very rare epileptiform activity, non-epileptiform anomalies, or
which were located in brain lesions.
The peak of intracranial sigma energy was usually at the time of
the peak of scalp spindles, except in the anterior cingulate gyrus and

prefrontal region where it was delayed. This is in line with previous
works (Andrillon et al., 2011; Peter-Derex et al., 2012) showing that
centroparietal spindles occurred on average 200 ms earlier than frontal
spindles. In addition, we conﬁrmed the presence of a caudo-rostral gradient of intracranial sigma energy at the time of scalp spindles: sigma
frequencies in frontal structures are lower than sigma frequencies in
centroparietal structures. This result also conﬁrms that of previous
authors who investigated spindle rates and frequencies over different
intracranial regions (Andrillon et al., 2011; Peter-Derex et al., 2012),
and is in line with scalp quantitative EEG studies demonstrating fast
parietal spindles and slow frontal spindles (Anderer et al., 2001).
Do spindles have a consistent intracranial correlate?
We found that individual sleep spindles are highly variable
concerning the increases in sigma band energy in intracranial structures. One explanation comes from the recent concept of human sleep
as a local phenomenon (Krueger et al., 2008): the reticular nucleus in
the thalamus generates sleep spindles (Fuentealba and Steriade,
2005), but the expression of the thalamic input is modulated by the activation state of the individual cortical columns. This hypothesis is in
line with the studies of Steriade (2006) demonstrating in the cat
model that sleep spindles occur predominantly during the “up” or
depolarizing state of the slow waves. Moreover, intracranial spindles
were recently shown to be more local than generalized during human
sleep (Andrillon et al., 2011).
Synchrony of spindles
We studied synchrony of spindles by calculating the crosscorrelation function and the distribution of the local minima in the signals in an interval of ±50 ms around the spindle onset. Interestingly, we
found a low synchrony of intracranial sigma activity in contrast to synchronous spindles in the scalp EEG channels. Multiple asynchronous
spindles were described with MEG, which is in contrast to scalp EEG
ﬁndings (Dehghani et al., 2011). Moreover, during cat experiments,

cortical barbiturate spindles were shown to appear either as local spindles in restricted cortical areas or as generalized spindles over several
areas. However, even generalized spindles were clearly different with
regard to intra-spindle wave frequency, duration, and the time of start
and stop of the spindles among different lobes, and more pronounced
between both hemispheres (Andersen et al., 1967).
A local cortical inﬂuence on spindle generation presents one potential explanation for the low synchrony of intracranial spindles (Krueger
et al., 2008). The role of laminar-dependent cortico-thalamic projections or thalamo-cortical projections via the core or matrix cells of the
dorsal thalamus could represent alternative or additional explanations
to our ﬁndings (Jones, 2009). Also, the presence of relatively simultaneous but not synchronized spindles generated in many brain regions
may result in a scalp spindle, due to the summation effect of the skull.
In line with this a recent study in monkeys demonstrated that the
scalp EEG power was explained by both synchrony (spectral coherence)
and amplitude of the intracranial activity, with synchrony contributing
40% and amplitude 60% (Musall et al., 2014). Hence, the observed widespread increase in amplitude of asynchronous sigma band activity could
be sufﬁcient to explain the presence of synchronous scalp spindles.
Further studies should be pursued to conﬁrm this hypothesized
mechanism of scalp spindle generation.
Association of scalp spindles, hippocampal spindles & hippocampal ripple
band energy
The role of fast centroparietal spindles for memory consolidation
and learning has been demonstrated by different groups (Moelle and
Born, 2011; Fogel and Smith, 2011; Ferrara et al., 2012). A temporal
coupling between slow oscillations, spindles and ripples may serve
hippocampo-neocortical communication resulting in memory consolidation during sleep. This temporal coupling was only recently demonstrated in humans who underwent EEG recording with foramen ovale
electrodes in the setting of preoperative epilepsy evaluations
(Clemens et al., 2007, 2011). The authors found that ripple activity
was increased before spindle peaks and distinctly decreased after the

B. Frauscher et al. / NeuroImage 105 (2015) 1–12

peak. We investigated a different perspective by comparing the amount
of ripple band activity during scalp spindles as well as hippocampal
spindles, and ripple band activity during non-spindle control segments.
We found no signiﬁcant difference in the hippocampal ripple band energy at time of scalp or hippocampal spindles and control intervals.
This makes it unlikely that the relationship between spindles and limbic
function is mediated by spindle-facilitated ripples. It does not exclude,
however, another form of functional relationship between spindles
and limbic function for memory consolidation during sleep.

be also seen in a mastoid referential montage. The study may have
suffered from a poor resolution due to limited sampling. We have
adequately sampled the frontal, parietal and temporal neocortices, but
less adequately the mesial temporal structures, the insula and the occipital cortex. However, the present study reports data on 35 patients
which represents the largest group reported for intracranial sleep
analysis. Another limitation is that the scalp EEG was limited to nine
electrodes placed at frontal, central and parietal positions.
Conclusions

Scalp and intracranial sigma energy at the time of hippocampal or insula
spindles
In contrast to the usually widespread increase in sigma activity at the
time of scalp spindles, no simultaneous sigma energy increase was
observed in the mesiolimbic structures. This ﬁnding can either be explained by a general lack of spindles in the hippocampus, or hippocampal spindles that are not time-locked to the scalp spindles. We found
that hippocampal spindles are largely independent of scalp spindles.
They are shorter and less frequent. Since we only investigated channels
of normal hippocampi (as based on patients' history, MRI results, and
interictal and ictal ﬁndings), we are conﬁdent that these spindles are a
physiological and not an epileptic phenomenon (Montplaisir et al.,
1981; Malow et al., 1999). The issue of whether hippocampal spindles
are also present in the epileptic hippocampus awaits further investigation, and cannot be answered by the present data.
Hippocampal spindles were more spatially restricted compared to a
widespread sigma energy distribution at the time of scalp spindles. Increases in sigma band energy with hippocampal spindles were mostly
found within the temporal lobe and to a small extent in the frontal
areas and the scalp. In line with our ﬁndings, Sarasso et al. (2014)
demonstrated that hippocampal spindles are already present minutes
before the ﬁrst spindle seen in the scalp. The fact that we did not ﬁnd
a simultaneous increase of sigma band energy in the parietal lobe
should be interpreted with caution, as data derive from only seven
parietal intracranial bipolar channels.
Spindles in the insula were investigated to assess another remote
brain structure. We found that spindles were present in the insula
with spindle rates between those of the hippocampus and the scalp
EEG. At time of insula spindles a widespread increase in sigma energy
was found in all evaluated areas with lowest increases in the temporal
lobe.
Limitations
Intracranial EEG recording in the setting of pre-surgical epilepsy
evaluation is a unique opportunity to study directly intracerebral neuronal activity, acknowledging that these recordings are limited to epilepsy
patients with all or part of their usual antiepileptic medication. To partially overcome the problem of studying potentially abnormal brain,
two electrophysiologists selected only channels with no or rare epilepsy
potentials as well as no non-epileptic anomalies, and located in normal
looking MRI regions. Also, the fact that scalp spindle rates corresponded
to that of healthy persons (Nicolas et al., 2001) makes us conﬁdent that
our ﬁndings reﬂect normal sleep physiology. Moreover, due to the
special setting of invasive EEG recording, scalp spindles were detected
in a bipolar montage along the antero-posterior axis, as done by other
authors working with depth electrode recordings (e.g. Sarasso et al.,
2014), and not in a referential montage to the mastoid as recommended
for sleep recordings. Even if a mastoid electrode was available, it could
cause problems in temporal lobe epilepsy as the mastoid records epileptic activity from the temporal lobe. To account for the reference issue,
we checked prior to this study whether conventional sleep recordings
with the same electrodes using a bipolar and mastoid reference montage would reveal the same spindle events. In line with Werth et al.
(1997) we found that most spindles seen in the bipolar montage can

This study demonstrated widespread intracranial sigma activity at
the time of spindles in the scalp. This intracranial sigma activity showed
a high variability across individual spindles, and a low synchrony compared to the synchronized spindles seen in scalp EEG. Hippocampal
spindles were, on the other hand, more locally restricted. Our ﬁndings
suggest that the generation of spindles is under a higher than expected
focal cortical inﬂuence contributing to the concept of sleep as a local
phenomenon and challenging the notion of spindles as a widespread
synchronous discharge.

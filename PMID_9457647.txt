The morphological (n = 66) and electrophysiological (n = 41) properties of eighty-six
thalamocortical (TC) neurones and those of one interneurone in the cat ventrobasal (VB)
thalamus were examined using an in vitro slice preparation. The resting membrane potential
for thirty-seven TC neurones was -61P9 + 0 7 mV, with thirteen neurones exhibiting delta
oscillation with and without DC injection.
The voltage-current relationships of TC neurones were highly non-linear, with a mean peak
input resistance of 254-4 MQ and a mean steady-state input resistance of 80-6 MQ. between
-60 and -75 mV. At potentials more positive than -60 mV, outward rectification led to a
mean steady-state input resistance of 13-3 MQ. At potentials more negative than -75 mV,
there was inward rectification, consisting of a fast component leading to a mean peak input
resistance of 14-5 MQ, and a slow time-dependent component leading to a mean steadystate input resistance of 10-6 MQ2.
Above -60 mV, three types of firing were exhibited by TC neurones. The first was an
accelerating pattern associated with little spike broadening and a late component in the
spike after-hyperpolarization. The second was an accommodating or intermittent pattern
associated with spike broadening, while the third was a burst-suppressed pattern of firing
also associated with spike broadening, but with broader spikes of a smaller amplitude. All
TC neurones evoked high frequency (310-520 Hz) burst firing mediated by a low threshold

Ca2+ potential.
4. Morphologically TC neurones were divided into two groups: Type I (n = 31 neurones) which
had larger soma, dendritic arbors that occupied more space, thicker primary dendrites and
daughter dendrites that followed a more direct course than Type II (n = 35). The only
electrophysiological differences were that Type I neurones (n = 16) had smaller peak input
and outward rectification resistance and spike after-hyperpolarization, but greater peak
inward rectification resistance, and exhibited delta oscillation less often than Type II

(n= 13).

The morphologically identified interneurone exhibited no outward rectification, only
moderate inward rectification, and no high frequency firing associated with the offset of
negative current steps below -55 mV. This interneurone had a regular accommodating firing
pattern, but the spike after-hyperpolarization had a late component, unlike the
accommodating firing in TC neurones.
Therefore, the differentiation of TC neuronal types in the cat VB thalamus based on their
morphology was reflected by differences in peak input resistance, outward rectification and
spike after-hyperpolarization, which could be accounted for by their difference in soma size.
More importantly, the firing pattern of the majority of TC neurones in the cat VB thalamus
were different from those of TC neurones in other sensory thalamic nuclei.
Thalamocortical neurones in the cat VB thalamus were also clearly distinguishable from the
interneurone based on the presence of their prominent outward rectification, peak inward
rectification and robust low threshold Ca2' potentials.

The ventrobasal (VB) thalamus, the primary somatosensory
region of the thalamus, consists of the ventral posterior
medial (VPM) and ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nuclei,
and contains small and large thalamocortical (TC) neurones
projecting to layers 1 and 2 and layers 4 and 5 of the
somatosensory cortex, respectively (Penny, Itoh & Diamond,
1982; Rausell & Avendanjo, 1985), and local circuit
interneurones (Spreafico, Schmechel, Ellis & Rustioni,
1983a; Yen, Conley & Jones, 1985). A large number of in

vivo and in vitro studies has also investigated the electrical
behaviour of VB neurones with respect to its role in
somatosensory processing (Salt, 1986; Gottshalt, VahleHinz & Hicks, 1989), sleep rhythms (Steriade, Jones &
Llinas, 1990) and absence epilepsy (Prince & Farrell, 1969;
Huguenard & Prince, 1994), and, in particular, this nuclear
complex is one of the main thalamic sites to record activity
associated with delta waves during slow wave sleep
(Steriade & Contreras, 1995) and with the spike and wave
discharge of absence epilepsy (Avoli & Gloor, 1982; Vergnes,
Marescaux & Depaulis, 1990). However, no systematic
analysis of the subthreshold membrane properties and firing
patterns of TC neurones and interneurones in the VB has
been carried out so far, and, in view of recent findings, it
would be inappropriate to deduce this information by a
simple process of analogy from similar neuronal types in
other thalamic nuclear groups. In fact, although the original
electrophysiological studies on the membrane properties of
TC neurones had indicated a large degree of similarity
across nuclei and species (Jahnsen & Llina's, 1984a,b;
Deschenes, Paradis, Roy & Steriade, 1984; Jones, 1985),
clear differences have also been highlighted by recent
investigations. In particular, intracellular recording in vivo
has indicated that there are differences between intralaminar and sensory thalamic nuclear groups (Steriade,
Curro-Dossi & Contreras, 1993), and the inward rectifying
current 'h has been shown to be absent from TC neurones of
the dorsal medial geniculate nucleus (Hu, 1995), unlike the
ventral medial geniculate nucleus and other thalamic nuclei
(McCormick & Pape, 1990; Hu, 1995). In addition, within
each thalamic nucleus, electrophysiological analysis using
intracellular current clamp recordings in vitro has shown
that TC neurones and interneurones are distinguishable on
the basis of their membrane properties (Jahnsen & Llina's,
1984a; Deschenes et al. 1984; Pape & McCormick, 1995;
Williams, Turner, Anderson & Crunelli, 1996), although in
the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) this distinction
between TC neurones and interneurones is less clear under
voltage clamp conditions, since it merely reflects the
differences in the size and/or the voltage dependence of
some of their intrinsic ionic conductances (Pape, Budde,
Alager & Kisvarday, 1994).
The aim of the present study, therefore, was to examine the
membrane and firing properties of neurones in the cat VB
thalamus and, by ascertaining their morphology, to
compare these properties for small and large TC neurones.
The findings presented here, and in the accompanying

J Physiol. 505.3

papers (Williams, T6th, Turner, Hughes & Crunelli, 1997 a;
Williams, Turner, Hughes & Crunelli, 1997 b), clearly
indicate the presence of important differences and similarities
with other thalamic nuclei and between large and small TC
neurones within the VB. Some of these results have been
published in preliminary form (Turner, Anderson &
Crunelli, 1994).

METHODS
Preparation of cat VB thalamic slices
Young adult male and female cats (1-1P5 kg) were deeply
anaesthetized with a mixture of 02 and NO2 (2: 1) and 1 %
halothane. The top of the skull was exposed, a wide craniotomy
performed and the meninges were removed. The animals were
killed by a coronal cut at the level of the inferior colliculus, and,
following transection of the optic tracts, the brain was removed and
submerged in ice-cold (1-4 0C) oxygenated (95% 02-5% C02)
modified Krebs medium containing (mM): KCl, 5; KH2P04, 1 25;
MgSO4, 5; CaC12, 1; NaHCO3, 16; glucose, 10; sucrose, 250. The
brain was bisected along the mid-line and each half was trimmed
dorsally, laterally and rostrally to generate a block of tissue
containing the whole thalamus. Each block was then affixed,
ventral surface uppermost, to the cutting stage of a Vibroslice
(Campden Instruments) with cyanoacrylate adhesive and trimmed
until the ventral surface of the VB was visible, at the level of the
anterior commisure (see plate 148 of Berman & Jones, 1982).
Horizontal sections 500 /um thick were then cut and slices of VB
thalamus prepared by excising the more lateral regions of the main
thalamic field corresponding to the VPL and VPM thalamic nuclei
plus the adjacent nucleus reticularis thalami and internal capsule
(see plates 144-148 of Berman & Jones, 1982; see also pp. 292-293
of Spreafico, Whitsel, Rustioni & McKenna, 1983 b). The
preparation of slices was stopped once the ventral surface of the
dLGN was reached (see plate 143 of Berman & Jones, 1982), as the
presence of the VB thalamus was no longer certain. These slices
were then placed in a storage chamber containing a continuously
oxygenated (95% 02-5% C02) Krebs medium, in which 134 mm
NaCl replaced the sucrose, and maintained at room temperature
(20-22 0C).
Recording procedures
Slices were left in the storage chamber for at least 1 h before being
transferred to a recording chamber where they were perfused with
a continuously oxygenated (95% 02-5% C02) medium of similar
composition, but with 1 mm MgSO4 plus 2 mm CaC12 replacing the
5 mM MgSO4 plus 1 mm CaCl2, respectively. This medium also
contained the excitatory amino acid antagonists D,L-2-amino-5phosphonovaleric acid (APV, 100 /,M), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline2,3-dione (CNQX, 20 ,UM), 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466, 100 ,uM)
and (5R,10S)4+)-5-methyl-10,1 1 -dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen malate (MK 801, 10 uM), and the
inhibitory amino acid antagonists bicuculline methiodide (50 UM)
and 3-aminopropyl-(diethoxymethyl)-phosphonic acid (CGP 35348,
500 /M) so that synaptic transmission mediated by ionotropic
L-glutamate, GABAA and GABAB receptors would not influence the
properties of recorded neurones. Slices were maintained at a
temperature of 35 + 1 0C, and left for a further 1 h before
recording commenced.
In order to obtain full voltage-current plots and firing patterns
using the current clamp technique, thin-walled glass micro-

J Physiol. 505.3

electrodes (GC 120TF; Clark Electromedical Instruments) filled
xwith 1 M potassium acetate (30-60 MQ2) were used. Biocytin (2%)
wras included in the intracellular recording solution, so that impaled
neurones could be subsequently identified. Preliminary intracellular
recordings made with standard walled glass (GC 120F, Clark
Electromedical Instruments) filled with 1 M potassium acetate
(70-100 MQ) were excluded on the grounds that the pronounced
inward and outward rectification of the recorded VB TC neurones
may, in part, have been the result of electrode artifacts in some
cases. Note, however, that the interneurone was recorded using a
standard walled glass microelectrode. Upon amplification with the
Axoclamp-2A, voltage and current records were stored on a
Biologic DAT recorder and later analysed with pCLAMIP software,
having been digitized at 1-100 kHz via a DigiData 1200 interface.

Identification of neuronal types
The criteria for the identification of TC and interneurones were
similar to those described previously for the dLGN (Crunelli, Kelly,
Leresche & Pirchio, 1987 a; Crunelli, Leresche & Parnavelas, 1987 b;
Pape & McCormick, 1995; Williams et al. 1996). Thus, the TC
neurones were characterized using two features of their membrane
properties. The first was a robust low threshold CaP+ potential
(LTCP) which could be evoked by the injection of either positive or
negative current steps, when the membrane potential was held
more negative than -65 mV. The second was the biphasic inward
rectification of the voltage-current relationship at membrane
potentials more negative than -75 mV, with a characteristic timedependent depolarizing 'sag' of the membrane potential, and the
outward rectification at inembrane potentials more positive than
-55 mV. The validity of this method was confirmed following the
recovery of these neurones for histological analysis, since they all
had morphologies similar to those identified in previous anatomical
studies (Spreafico et al. 1983a; Yen et al. 1985; Nomura, Nishikawa
&Yokota, 1992).
Analysis of membrane properties
The parameters of the voltage-current relationship used in this
study were determined from voltage responses to current steps over
the range -90 to -40 mV. In order to avoid the generation of a
LTCP by positive current steps during the determination of the
voltage-current relationship or the appearance of delta oscillation,
the membrane potential of most neurones was depolarized by DC
injection until the LTCP was no longer evoked by positive current
steps. The voltage responses were then measured at their peak

709

deflection during, and at the apparent steady-state 10 ms before
the offset of, the current steps. Once the two curves for the peak
(Fig. 1, open circles) and steady-state (Fig. 1, filled circles)
voltage-current relationship had been constructed, the slope
resistance was measured by fitting regression lines to the regions of
interest (Fig. 1). The voltage limits (Fig. 1, points 3 and 4) for the
steep region of peak input resistance were determined from the
points at which the peak voltage-current relationship deviated
from the regression line (Fig. 1, line 1) fitted to the steep region.
Biocytin injection and anatomical procedures
The injection of biocytin into neurones was accomplished without
using an ejection protocol (Williams et al. 1996). The location of
each filled neurone was recorded on outline drawings of the brain
slice. Two neurones per slice were routinely filled, separated by
sufficient space to allow subsequent unequivocal identification of
their dendritic field and appendages during morphological analysis.
The histological processing was performed as described previously
(Williams et al. 1996). The morphology of the stained neurones was
examined using light microscopy and measurements of somal and
dendritic area were made from camera lucida reconstructions made
at x 1300 and x 200, respectively. Somal and dendritic areas were
calculated according to the methods described by Spreafico et al.
(1983a) where the area (A) is calculated from A = nab, where a and
b are the minimum and maximum radii, respectively. Dendritic
field density analysis was performed by counting the number of
dendritic branches every 20 ,m, using the method of Sholl (1953).
Illustrated TC neurone reconstructions were made at a magnification
of x 625 and the interneurone reconstruction at x 1300.
Statistics and drug sources
Quantitative results are expressed in the text and figures as
means + S.E.M. or means with the range in parentheses, depending
on whether the data were normally distributed or not
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, SigmaStat). Significance was tested
using either Student's t test or the paired t test, depending on the
experimental design, if the data were normally distributed, or the
MIann-XVhitney U test if they were not. CNQX and APV were
purchased from Tocris Cookson; MK 801 was from RBI and
bicuculline methiodide from Sigma. CGP 35348 was a kind gift
from Dr W. Froestl (Ciba-Geigy, Switzerland) and GYKI 52466 a
kind gift from Dr I. Tarnawa (Institute for Drug Research,
Budapest).

RESULTS
Intracellular recordings were obtained from a total of
eighty-seven neurones in the cat VB thalamus. From these
recordings, forty-one neurones were selected since only
these contained all the electrophysiological data sufficient to
construct the database for the TC neurones in this study. Of
these forty-one neurones, twenty-nine could be visualized
sufficiently well following histological processing and,
without exception, these neurones were identified as being
TC neurones. These twenty-nine neurones therefore
represent the database of neurones for which we had
complete electrophysiological and morphological data. A
further thirty-seven TC neurones were sufficiently well-

filled for morphological analysis to be performed, although
their electrophysiological data were incomplete. Only for
one recovered neurone with properties similar to VB
interneurones was the complete set of electrophysiological
data available. The locations of all the recorded neurones
were within the boundaries of the VB thalamus (Fig. 2). No
attempt was made to distinguish the shell (nociceptive and
wide dynamic range units) and core (low threshold
mechanoreceptive) regions, since a previous study had
indicated no difference in the morphology of the neuronal
types found in these regions (Spreafico et al. 1983a; Yen et
al. 1985; Nomura et al. 1992).

luxuriant and extensive dendritic arborization, as described
by Spreafico et al. (1983a).

Three types of neurone were identified qualitatively in this
study using criteria developed from previous descriptions of
their dendritic morphology (Spreafico et al. 1983a; Yen et al.
1985): two classes of TC neurones, and a local circuit
interneurone. The TC neurones were divided into two
groups since the dendritic fields of Type I (n = 31),
compared with those of Type II (n = 35), were typically
less spatially compact, had a less tortuous course, the
terminal dendritic branch points occurred further from the
soma, and the diameter of the primary dendrites was
greater, than for Type II (n = 35). No other primary
dendritic characteristics were used, including the previously
described 'tufting' and 'bifurcating' patterns of primary
dendritic division (Yen et al. 1985), since tufting was rarely
observed. The interneurone had a small round soma with a

Somatic and primary dendritic features of TC neurones.
The soma of Type I TC neurones were generally polygonal
in shape, and occasionally were 'hairy' in appearance, while
those of Type II were smaller (Table 1), more spherical and
had a smooth appearance (Fig. 3Aa and Ba), as described
previously (Spreafico et al. 1983; Yen et al. 1985). This
second group was split into two subtypes based on the
length of the proximal dendrites (Table 1): Type IIa and
Type II b. Type II a (n = 7) possessed at least four large
primary dendrites (Fig. 3Ab), usually arising from opposing
quadrants, which branched profusely and matched the
previous description of 'small round' neurones (Spreafico et
al. 1983), while Type IIb (n = 28) had shorter primary
dendrites (Table 1) which branched much less profusely

(Fig. 3Ac). The primary dendrites of Type I TC neurones
were of similar length to Type IIb but shorter than
Type II a, and of larger diameter than both Type II
subtypes. The secondary dendrites of Type I TC neurones
showed little change in calibre compared with those of
Type II, which were finer than their primaries (Table 1).
Distal dendritic features of TC neurones. The dendritic
fields of Type I TC neurones were larger than that of
Type II (Table 1), and the distal dendritric morphology of

Type I neurones (Fig. 3A) was characterized by being less
spatially compact with dendritic calibre being maintained,
following bifurcation, over a larger part of the dendritic field
compared with that of Type II. In addition, the terminal
branch point of Type I TC neurones occurred more distally
than Type II, so that the distal dendrites made up a smaller
proportion of total dendritic length, and so Type I neurones
had a larger number of dendritic branches per dendritic
arbor at 160-180 jum from the soma (Fig. 4).

The dendritic paths of Type I TC neurones varied from
those which were tortuous yet quite direct (Fig. 3Aa and b),
to a completely straight course (Fig. 5D), coincident with a
finer dendritic calibre and smooth appearance. In contrast,
Type II were typified by a sinuous path with tortuous
twists, providing the appearance of a 'knot' of dendrites

(Fig. 3Ba, Bb, Ca and Cb) as daughters emerged at oblique
angles.
For both Type I and II TC neurones with tortuous dendritic
paths, stud-like appendages were observed singly or in
clusters, proximal to primary, secondary or tertiary branch
points (Fig. 5A-C and E). Those Type I TC neurones with
tortuous dendritic paths also had short hair-like protrusions,
which increased in density towards the periphery of the
dendritic field, and which, in a few cases, were also present
on the soma, lending these neurones their hairy appearance
(Fig. 3Aa). In contrast, Type I TC neurones with smooth
straight dendrites had no appendages at all (Fig. 5D).

The morphology of an interneurone
The putative interneurones had a small round soma (area,
2348 #Mm2), and four identifiable principle dendrites (Fig. 6).
At each primary dendritic branch point, there was a

profusion of secondary dendritic processes, forming an
extensive dendritic field (area, 0-254 mm2), whose total
volume was probably truncated by the brain slicing
procedure. Along the length of each dendrite there were
many stud-like protrusions with thin thread-like appendages
arising at regular intervals. These appendages bifurcated
repeatedly forming a dense network (Fig. 6B), with each
fibre exhibiting varicosities along their entire length

(Fig. 6C).
The membrane properties of TC neurones
Resting membrane potential and delta oscillation. A
mean stable resting membrane potential of -61-9 + 0 7 mV
was measured for thirty-seven of the forty-one TC neurones
studied (Table 2). The four remaining TC neurones had nonstable membrane potentials in the absence of injected DC,
owing to the-presence of delta (or pacemaker) oscillation
(frequency range, 1-4 Hz), as demonstrated in other thalamic
nuclei both in vitro and in vivo (McCormick & Pape, 1990;
Leresche, Lightowler, Soltesz, Jassik-Gerschenfeld &
Crunelli, 1991; Nunez, Amzica & Steriade 1992). Nine of
the thirty-seven TC neurones with stable resting membrane
potentials also exhibited delta oscillation when either
positive or negative DC was injected (Fig. 7A), so that 32 %

J P Turner, C. M. Anderson, S. R. Williams and V Crunelli

716

of all TC neurones exhibited delta oscillation (Table 2). In
addition, TC neurones exhibiting delta oscillation had
significantly greater mean peak input resistance than those
that did not show oscillation (Table 2), suggesting that the
TC neurones with larger peak input resistances are more
likely to exhibit delta oscillation.

Voltage-current relationship. The voltage-current
relationship (determined at a membrane potential of
-57-4 + 04 mV) was highly non-linear for all TC neurones
(Fig. 8), and characterized by a steep region with the
highest peak input resistance between -59-8 + 0 4 and
-75*4 + 1-3 mV (Table 2). The mean peak input resistance
over this region was 254-3 MQ, (48-9-995-3 MQl) and the

distribution of these values was skewed towards the higher
values (Fig. 7B). These peak input resistance values were
not correlated to resting membrane potential (r = 0 14,
P > 0 1,
n = 37),
suggesting that the subthreshold
conductances responsible for the peak input resistance are
not involved in determining resting membrane potential.
The examination of voltage responses to negative current
steps in this membrane potential range has been used to
establish the passive membrane properties of TC neurones
(Bloomfield, Hamos & Sherman, 1987; Crunelli et al. 1987 b;
Williams et al. 1996). In this membrane potential range
there was also a clear depolarizing sag of the voltage
response to negative current steps for all TC neurones, even
for those with lower input resistance (as the one shown in

activity occurs. The uppermost and lowermost records are at the stable membrane potentials below and
above which, respectively, changes in injected DC elicit the types of voltage fluctuations illustrated by the
intermediate traces. The second trace down illustrates how membrane potential moves in and out of the
oscillation envelope at its uppermost extreme. The frequency of the delta oscillations in the third and fourth

Properties of ventrobasal thalamic neurones

Fig. 8Aa), so that the mean steady-state input resistance
was 80-6 MQ2 (n = 40) (Table 2). Therefore, none of these
neurones had membrane properties that could be considered
passive in the -60 to -75 mV range, and analysis of the
electrotonic structure of these TC neurones was not
performed. For TC neurones with higher input resistance,
voltage responses in this range were characterized either by
non-monoexponential change of the membrane potential
(Fig. 8Ab, inset) or by a multiphasic response (Fig. 8Ac,
inset). Thus, there was a more dynamic voltage response to
injected current, characterized by the peak of the voltage
response, and hence the peak input resistance, being time
dependent over a period of several hundred milliseconds
(Fig. 8Ac and d). In addition, this behaviour resulted in an
increased non-linearity in the voltage-current relationship
for TC neurones of the cat VB thalamus (Fig. 8Ba-d), in
comparison to those previously reported for other thalamic
nuclei (Bloomfield et al. 1987; Crunelli et al. 1987a,b;
Williams et al. 1996), such that one neurone exhibited
apparent membrane bistability (Fig. 8Bd), where two
voltage responses of differing amplitude could be evoked by
a current step of the same amplitude (Fig. 8Ad). A detailed
investigation of these phenomena is presented in the
accompanying paper (Williams et al. 1997 a).

Inward rectification. The inward rectification consisted of
two distinct phases. The initial phase occurred within the
first 100-500 ms of current injection, and was characterized
by a non-linear increase in the voltage response with respect
to injected current (Fig. 8), so that over the rectified range
below -80 mV the mean peak input resistance was 14 5 MQ2
(8f2-37'8 MQ) (Table 2). This peak inward rectification
resistance was found to be inversely correlated to the peak
input resistance of the steep region of the voltage-current
relationship (r = 0-387, P < 0 05, n = 40), indicating that
TC neurones with the more dynamic voltage responses in
the steep region of the voltage-current relationship exhibit
more peak inward rectification. Subsequent to this, there
was a slow time-dependent rectification apparent as a
depolarizing sag of the membrane potential between
500-2000 ms, which led to a mean steady-state input
resistance of 10-6 MQ2 (4-1-24-2 MQL) (Table 2). This steadystate inward rectification resistance was not correlated to
the peak input resistance (r = 0 075, P > 0-1, n = 40).
There was, however, a positive correlation between the size
of the depolarizing sag and the peak of the voltage response
for each of the non-oscillating neurones (P < 0-05-0-01,
n = 28) (Table 2). A detailed analysis of the properties of
inward rectification in TC neurones of the cat VB thalamus
is presented in the accompanying paper (Williams et al.

1997 b).
Outward rectification and action potential threshold.
The voltage responses to positive current steps peaked
either within the first 100 ms followed by a hyperpolarizing
sag of the membrane potential (Fig. 8Ab), or at the end of
the step following a slow depolarizing ramp (Fig. 8Ad), or
reflected a combination of the two (Fig. 8Aa and c). These

717

responses showed a pronounced outward rectification in the
voltage-current relationship, with an input resistance of
13-3 + 1 1 MQ2. As the membrane potential approached
action potential threshold, there was an increase in small
amplitude voltage perturbations, indicative of the interaction
of voltage-dependent conductances in the range of voltage
just subthreshold. The threshold for action potential firing
was -42 4 + 0 4 mV for all forty-one TC neurones, with the
individual values being positively correlated to the peak
input resistance (r = 0-324, P < 005, n =41), but not to
the outward rectification resistance (r= 0169, P> 01,
n = 41), suggesting that the subthreshold conductances
responsible for the peak input resistance, but not outward
rectification, influence firing threshold.

LTCP and associated burst firing. Characteristically,
LTCPs were evoked in all forty-one TC neurones at the
offset of negative current steps during the determination of
the voltage-current relationships. The mean maximum
number of action potentials evoked by the LTCP in each TC
neurone was seven (3-12), with an interspike frequency for
the first interspike interval of 414 Hz (317-507 Hz). This
interspike frequency was correlated to the overall number
of spikes in the burst (r = 0f331, P < 0 05, n = 41)
(Fig. 9Ba-d), but not to the membrane potential prior to the
offset of the current step (r= 0'074, P> 01, n= 41). In
addition, the first spike in the burst was always the largest
in amplitude, with the second spike the smallest (see, for
example, the dramatic decrease in amplitude for the neurone
in Fig. 9Ab) and each subsequent spike showing some
recovery of spike amplitude towards that of the first
(Fig. 9Aa-d). Note also that, while the higher input
resistance of the neurone in Fig. 9Ab (compared with Aa)
could have been responsible for the larger number of action
potentials in the bursts, for the neurones in Fig. 9Ac and d
with the much higher input resistance there was a smaller
number of action potentials. The large number of action
potentials and their characteristic decrease in amplitude
could represent a peculiarity of the cat VB thalamus
compared with other thalamic nuclei.
Firing patterns. The pattern of action potential discharge
evoked in TC neurones of the cat VB thalamus by positive
current steps from a membrane potential of -60 mV was
highly variable, but could be classified into three categories
(Fig. 1OA and B). The first type, accelerating, was
characterized by a regular accelerating firing pattern (n = 4)
at a relatively low frequency between 20-70 Hz (Fig. IOA).
The second type was characterized by a marked decrease
in spike frequency (n = 24), with firing either being
accommodating (i.e. regular firing at an initial frequency
of 90-140 Hz, then decreasing to 20-60 Hz), or being
intermittent (i.e. an initial period of firing at a frequency of
80-200 Hz, followed by irregular periods of firing with a
frequency up to 80 Hz). The third group, burst-suppressed
firing, was characterized by an initial burst of action
potentials at 60-270 Hz, associated with an attenuation of
spike amplitude, followed by a period of quiescence or

negative current step from the same TC neurones as in Fig. 9Aa-d, respectively. In each case, the first spike in the burst is

amplitude towards that of the first. The membrane potential just prior to each current step offset is shown to the left of each

neurone in Aa has voltage responses of conventional electrotonic structure, and a -relatively linear relationship to the current
injection (see inset), those in Ab-d possess a highly non-linear relationship between injected current and the amplitude and time
to peak of the voltage response, particularly for the neurones illustrated in Ac and d (see insets). In Ad, the arrows mark the two
voltage responses that could be obtained by the same current step. Calibration bars in the insets represents 1 nA, 10 mV and

deviations from a smooth sigmoid voltage-current relationship measured in the steady state (apparent over the range of
membrane potential between -60 and -75 mV) result from the presence of a LTCP at the time of measurement (see voltage
records in Ab and c). The peak input resistance in the steep region of the voltage-current relationship is indicated in each plot.

intermittent attenuated action potentials (n = 13). The first
action potential of the burst evoked during this type of
firing was characteristically smaller in amplitude in
comparison to the second action potential (Figs lOAb and
l l D inset) (Table 3). In addition, the first action potential of
burst-suppressed firing had a slower rise time compared
with the second, but the decay was faster. All but the
accelerating type of firing were associated with marked
spike broadening (Fig. 10C). These different firing patterns
were observed in sequential recordings from the same slice.

Single action potential properties. There was a clear
division between accelerating and accommodating/intermittent firing (Fig. 10), for which single action potentials
could be evoked (Fig. 1 lA-C), and burst-suppressed firing,
for which action potentials always occurred in bursts
(Fig. 1 lD). For the accelerating and accommodating/intermittent firing patterns,' action potential amplitudes were
very similar, and were significantly larger than those of the

burst-suppressed firing. However, the action potentials of
all firing types had similar rise times, except the first
action potential of burst-suppressed firing (Table 3). In
addition, the action potentials associated with accelerating
firing patterns had a faster decay than those of the other
types, so that the mean half-width of the action potential of
the accelerating firing was smaller than that of the
accommodating/intermittent firing, which in turn was
smaller than that of the burst-suppressed pattern.
The after-hyperpolarizations of the action potentials for
accelerating and accommodating/intermittent firing types
were of similar amplitude, although those for the accelerating
type had a slower time to peak and decay, owing to the
presence of a late component (Fig. 1lA-C) (Table 3). The first
but not the second action potential for the burst-suppressed
firing had an after-hyperpolarization that was larger in
amplitude than that of the other types, but both had a time
to peak comparable to that of the accommodating type.

potentials more positive than -60 mV. Note that, unlike the burst firing evoked by the LTCP, the
amplitude of the second spike is always similar to, or greater than, that of the first, and that a LTCP can be
evoked at the offset of the positive current step (see trace accommodating, Aa). The initial membrane

J Physiol. 505.3

Properties of ventrobasal thalamic neurones

Since burst-suppressed action potentials occurred at a
frequency greater than 50 Hz, the after-hyperpolarization
decay was very short.

The correlation of membrane properties with
morphology
The somal area and the peak input resistance were inversely
correlated for all twenty-nine TC neurones (r = 362,
P < 0 05, n = 29), as would be predicted if the peak input
resistance were a passive membrane property, but while
Type I neurones showed this inverse correlation (r = 0-585,
P< 0 05, n= 16), Type II did not (r= 0O181, P> 0 1,
n = 13). This could be explained by the non-linear
behaviour of the voltage responses in the -60 to -75 mV
range over which peak input resistance was measured.
Therefore, as Type II TC neurones have higher peak input
resistances than Type I (Table 2) and exhibited more nonlinear behaviour over this range, the measured peak input
A

B

721

resistance probably deviates more from the passive
membrane input resistance.

All differences in the subthreshold properties of the
morphologically identified TC neurones were consistent with
an underlying difference in the peak input resistance.
Certainly, the larger outward rectification resistance for
Type II TC neurones, compared with Type I (Table 2), was
consistent with a higher peak input resistance, if the
underlying leakage resistance was also higher. However, the
reason for the smaller peak inward rectification resistance of
Type II TC neurones was less clear, but in view of the later
time to peak of the voltage responses of these neurones,
more of the slow time-dependent inward rectification
probably contributed to the peak of the voltage responses.
Indeed, the steady-state inward rectification resistance for
Type II TC neurones was slightly larger than that for
Type I (Table 2).

Action potential and after-hyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude were measured from threshold. Afterhyperpolarization time to peak was measured from action potential peak time, and decay time was
measured between 10 and 90% of after-hyperpolarization amplitude. For comparisons with
accommodating firing type ap < 0.05, bp < 0.01, cp < 0.005 and dp< 0.001 (Student's t test or
Mann-Whitney U test). For comparisons with accelerating firing type ep< 0.05, fP< 0 01, gP< 0 005
and hp< 0.001 (Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test). For comparison of the second spike with the
first spike for burst-suppressed firing type iP < 0.005 and JP < 0 001 (Student's paired t test or
Mann-Whitney U test).

With respect to action potential firing, the accommodating/
intermittent and burst-suppressed patterns were fairly
equally distributed between the morphological TC neurone
types, but the accelerating pattern was only associated with
Type I (Table 3). There were no differences in the single
action potential properties between morphological type,
apart from the amplitude of the action potential afterhyperpolarization, which was smaller for Type I (12-1 +
0 4 mV) than for Type II (15-1 ± 04 mV; P < 0 05, Students
t test), consistent with the lower outward rectification
resistance observed for Type I. Therefore, the only clear
distinguishing feature of the membrane properties of
morphologically identified TC neurones from the cat VB
thalamus was the higher peak input resistance of Type II
neurones, and this was reflected by the larger number of
these neurones exhibiting delta oscillation (Table 2).

The membrane properties of an interneurone

to -0 01 nA step. The voltage-current relationship for this
interneurone exhibited a lack of outward rectification above
-60 mV, and only moderate inward rectification below
-70 mV (Fig. 12B), so that the peak input resistance
between -47 to -57 mV was 205X8 MQ, and between -80
to -95 mV was 130-6 MQl. In addition, there was some
further time-dependent depolarizing sag of the voltage
response (Fig. 12A and C), so that the steady-state input
resistance was 56-7 Mfl between -75 and -85 mV (Fig. 12B).
Low frequency (3-6 Hz) burst firing was only observed at
the offset of negative current steps from holding potentials
more positive than -55 mV, while at more negative
potentials only a single action potential could be generated

(Fig. 12C).
In response to positive current steps, this interneurone was

between spike frequency and injected current was
approximately linear from 0 to 0-25 nA, for all interspike
interval frequencies. However, at injected currents of
0 3-0 5 nA, there was a non-linear increase in the interspike
frequency for the first to fifth interspike intervals (Fig. 1 2Eb).
The single action potentials of the interneurone were
narrower and greater in amplitude than those of TC neurones
(Table 3), and had a biphasic after-hyperpolarization
(Fig. 1 E), with comparable amplitudes to, but much greater
times to peak than, those of TC neurones.

DISCUSSION
The main conclusions of this investigation are as follows.
(1) The voltage-current relationship for TC neurones from
the cat VB thalamus was highly non-linear with a steep
region of peak input resistance between -60 and -75 mV,
with some neurones also exhibiting a time-dependent
increase in voltage response, which accentuated this nonlinearity. (2) The action potential characteristics and
discharge pattern of these TC neurones varied from an
accelerating to a highly accommodating/intermittent or
burst-suppressed firing, and were different from those
observed in other sensory thalamic nuclei above -60 mV.
However, all morphologically identified TC neurones evoked
burst firing mediated by a LTCP. (3) Morphologically
distinct TC neurones were identified, and differed in their
subthreshold membrane properties, with a greater number
of the smaller Type II neurones exhibiting delta oscillation,
probably due to their higher peak input resistances. (4) The
morphologically identified interneurone had a more linear
voltage-current relationship, with almost no outward
rectification and a smaller inward rectification, and lacked
the high frequency action potential firing associated with a
LTCP.

The morphology of TC neurones from the cat VB
thalamus
The division of TC neurones in the cat VB thalamus into
Type I and Type II was based on the qualitative differences
in dendritic morphology, and is reflected by the quantitative
analysis showing a small but significant difference in the
distal part of the dendritic arbor, 160-180 #sm from the
soma. Since this dendritic region receives the majority of
the corticothalamic input (Ralston, 1991; Liu, Honda &
Jones, 1995), this difference may be of relevance in thalamocortical processing. It has been suggested that the differences
in the dendritic architecture of TC neurones are due to
scaling (Kniffki, Pawlak & Vahle-Hinz, 1993), and that
there are no overall quantitative differences (Havton &
Ohara, 1994; Ohara, Ralston & Havton, 1995). However,
use of small samples and the intracellular filling of only low
threshold mechanoreceptor-activated units may have
introduced a bias in these studies. Indeed, while two types
of TC neurone have been identified in approximately equal
numbers following the retrograde transport of horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) injected into the cortex, only four of the

J: Phy8iol. 505.3

nineteen TC neurones filled following intracellular HRP
injection in vivo were Type II neurones (Yen et al. 1985).
Therefore, the approximately equal number of Type I and
Type II neurones and the presence of dendritic appendages
indicate that ours is a representative sample of the TC
neuronal population in the cat VB thalamus, consistent with
the observations of Spreafico et al. (1983a) and Yen et al.

(1985).
The subthreshold electrophysiology of TC neurones
from cat VB thalamus
In this study the clear defining feature of all the morphologically identified TC neurones, but not of the interneurone,
was the presence of the LTCP, which has been found to be a
characteristic of all TC neurones of the mammalian thalamus
studied so far (Jahnsen & Llinas, 1984a; Deschenes et al.
1984; Crunelli et al. 1987a,b; Hu, 1995; Pape & McCormick,
1995; Williams et al. 1996). The voltage-current relationship
of these TC neurones, however, are highly non-linear, and
the membrane properties in the -60 to -75 mV range of
this relationship are not passive, in contrast to previous
results in TC neurones of other thalamic nuclei (Bloomfield et
al. 1987; Crunelli et al. 1987a,b; Hu, 1995). It is probable
that the properties associated with this region in some TC
neurones, whereby the amplitude of voltage responses
increases in a time-dependent manner, further accentuates
this non-linearity. As demonstrated in the accompanying
paper (Williams et al. 1997a) the cause of this phenomenon
in TC neurones of the cat and rat VB thalamus and dLGN is
the expression of the 'window' component of IT.
The firing patterns of TC neurones from cat VB
thalamus
The majority of TC neurones from the cat VB thalamus has
markedly different firing properties to those of TC
neurones in other sensory thalamic nuclei. Perhaps only
those neurones with regular accelerating or moderately
accommodating firing patterns could be considered similar
to those recorded intracellularly in vitro in the cat and rat
dLGN (Crunelli et al. 1987a,b; McCormick, 1991; Williams
et al. 1996), and guinea-pig thalamus (Jahnsen & Llinas,
1984a), since these studies revealed remarkable regular
firing patterns. Indeed, in TC neurones of the rat VB
thalamus, tonic firing is delayed and is much more irregular
than that observed in the dLGN (see Fig. 1 in Huguenard &
Prince, 1991), indicating that this difference in the firing
patterns is a characteristic of the VB thalamus across
species. Since the outward rectification observed in TC
neurones of the VB thalamus is greater than that reported
for other sensory thalamic nuclei in vitro (Jahnsen & Llinas,
1984a,b; Cruneili et al. 1987a,b; McCormick, 1991;
Williams et al. 1996), the voltage-dependent conductances
active in the range around spike threshold could be
determining this difference in firing properties. The more
regular firing patterns observed in vivo in the cat VB
thalamus (Deschenes et al. 1984) may result from the
neuromodulators released by brainstem afferent activity,
since these substances reduce the spike-frequency accom-

modation of action potential firing observed in vitro (see
McCormick, 1992).

Morphology and electrophysiology: implications for
somatosensory physiology
The electrophysiological differences between the morphological types of TC neurone in the cat VB thalamus probably
all resulted from the greater peak input resistance of
Type II neurones, and led to a greater predisposition to
delta oscillation in Type II. During aroused or awake states,
when afferent input and membrane conductance are high
and membrane potential is depolarized, these differences
would have little overall impact on physiological function.
Indeed, it is more likely that the functional differences are
dependent upon dendritic and synaptic organization, since
the difference between transient and sustained responses of
TC neurones in the VB thalamus to sensory stimuli (Yen et
al. 1985) is the strong GABAergic inhibition controlling
transient responses (Gottschalt et al. 1989). However, during
states when afferent input and membrane conductance are
low and membrane potential is hyperpolarized such as slow
wave sleep (Hirsch, Fourment & Marc, 1982), and during
pathological states such as absence epilepsy and the central
pain syndromes where burst firing is observed (Jeanmonod,
Magnin & Morel 1996), the impact of these differences
would be greater. In addition, since the small TC neurones
in the VB thalamus project to the superficial layers of the
somatosensory cortex (Penny et al. 1982; Rausell &
Avendanio, 1985), the greater predisposition of the smaller
Type II TC neurones to exhibit delta oscillation could be
important in the synchronization of thalamocortical
networks via these connections either through their intrinsic
activity or that driven synaptically.

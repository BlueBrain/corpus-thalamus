Abstract Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of highvoltage activated (HVA) Ca2+ channels was investigated in acutely isolated and identiﬁed thalamocortical
relay neurons of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus
(dLGN) by combining electrophysiological and immunological techniques. The inﬂuence of Ca2+-binding
proteins, calmodulin and the cytoskeleton on CDI was
monitored using double-pulse protocols (a constant
post-pulse applied shortly after the end of conditioning
pre-pulses of increasing magnitude). Under control
conditions the degree of inactivation (34±9%) revealed
a U-shaped and a sigmoid dependency of the post-pulse
current amplitude on pre-pulse voltage and charge inﬂux, respectively. In contrast to a high concentration
(5.5 mM) of EGTA (31±3%), a low concentration
(3 lM) of parvalbumin (20±2%) and calbindinD28K
(24±4%) signiﬁcantly reduced CDI. Subtype-speciﬁc
Ca2+ channel blockers indicated that L-type, but not Ntype Ca2+ channels are governed by CDI and modulated by Ca2+-binding proteins. These results point to
the possibility that activity-dependent changes in the
intracellular Ca2+-binding capacity can inﬂuence CDI
substantially. Furthermore, calmodulin antagonists
(phenoxybenzamine, 22±2%; calmodulin binding domain, 17±1%) and cytoskeleton stabilizers (taxol,
23±5%; phalloidin, 15±3%) reduced CDI. Taken toS. G. Meuth (&) Æ T. Kanyshkova Æ P. Landgraf Æ H.-C. Pape

Introduction
Thalamocortical relay neurons display two typical
modes of action potential generation: burst ﬁring with
between two and six action potentials riding on a lowthreshold Ca2+ spike during periods of slow-wave sleep
and tonic, single-spike activity with trains of action
potentials during states of wakefulness [15, 61]. Whilst
the role of low-voltage activated (LVA) Ca2+ channels
in rhythmic burst activity is well understood, much less
is known about the function of high-voltage activated
(HVA) Ca2+ channels in tonic ﬁring. In general, Ca2+
in thalamic cells has been regarded traditionally as a
common charge carrier. Recent experiments, however,
have begun to unravel a complex Ca2+-signalling network with interacting extra- and intracellular Ca2+
sources [11, 50]. Tonic patterns of Na+/K+ spikes,
known to mediate the transfer of sensory information
from the periphery to the primary sensory cortex, is
supported by activation of HVA Ca2+ currents, Ca2+induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from intracellular stores
via ryanodine receptors (RyR) and a repolarizing
mechanism involving Ca2+-dependent K+ channels [7,
10, 43]. Furthermore, tonic activity is accompanied by
transient increases in the intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i)
[45, 64] and is coupled to Ca2+-dependent inactivation
(CDI), thereby limiting the amount of Ca2+ entering the
cell [42, 43]. These data indicate a ﬁne tuning of

112

Ca2+-dependent mechanisms that will help to control
intracellular Ca2+ transients and associated Ca2+-signaling processes. Inactivation of Ca2+ channels is an
important component of this complex signalling system.
However, the rate and extent of inactivation varies
dramatically between Ca2+ channel subtypes and neuronal cell types [31]. In general, Ca2+ channels can
inactivate by either voltage-dependent (VDI) or Ca2+dependent processes, where CDI represents a classical
feedback mechanism between Ca2+ entry and [Ca2+]i
[11, 19, 26, 62].
Experiments in various types of cells have revealed a
range of mechanisms mediating CDI. For instance,
involvement of the cytoskeleton has been found in cardiac myocytes [34], hippocampal cells [4, 30] and snail
neurons [23, 29] and calmodulin has been identiﬁed as
the Ca2+ sensor for CDI of L-type and P/Q-type Ca2+
channels in expression systems [35, 53, 55, 65], whereby
these channels are regulated by calmodulin in a lobespeciﬁc manner [39]. To fulﬁl this function Ca2+-free
calmodulin and L-type Ca2+ channels are preassociated
as has been shown by ﬂuorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) two-hybrid mapping [20]. Furthermore,
other Ca2+-binding proteins like NCS-1 (neuronal Ca2+
sensor protein 1) or CaBP1 (neuronal Ca2+-binding
protein 1) modulate HVA Ca2+ channels in a manner
that is markedly diﬀerent from modulation by calmodulin [37, 57].
In thalamocortical relay neurons CDI is modulated by
counterbalancing phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
processes involving diﬀerent kinases [protein kinase A
(PKA), calcium-calmodulin (CaM) kinase] and protein
phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, calcineurin) [43]. The present
study was undertaken to further gain our knowledge
of HVA Ca2+ channel function in the thalamus by
probing the inﬂuence of Ca2+-binding proteins and the
cytoskeleton on CDI in thalamocortical relay neurons.

Materials and methods
Preparation
Long Evans rats (12-to 20-day-old) were decapitated
under halothane anaesthesia, the brains removed
quickly and placed in cold, oxygenated artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (ACSF) containing (mM): sucrose, 210;
1,4-piperazinediethanesulphonic acid (PIPES), 20; KCl,
2.4; MgCl2, 10; CaCl2, 0.5; dextrose, 10; pH 7.25 with
NaOH. Thalamic slices (400–500 lm) were obtained
from coronal sections according to procedures similar to
those reported previously [9, 42, 43]. In brief, slices were
cut on a vibratome (Model 1000, Ted Pella, Redding,
Calif., USA), transferred to a spinner ﬂask and incubated for 25–30 min at 30 °C in an oxygenated solution
containing trypsin (0.5–1 mg/ml, Sigma, Taufkirchen,
Germany) and (mM): NaCl, 120; KCl, 5; MgCl2, 3;
CaCl2, 1; PIPES, 20; dextrose, 25; pH adjusted to 7.35
with NaOH.

Electrophysiology
Single neurons were obtained by trituration and placed
under an inverted microscope (Axiovert 135, Zeiss, Jena,
Germany) as described previously [42, 43]. Whole-cell
recordings were performed at room temperature (21–
23 °C) using borosilicate glass pipettes (GC150TF-10,
Clark Electromedical Instruments, Pangbourne, UK)
connected to an EPC-7 ampliﬁer (E.S.F. electronics,
Friedland, Germany). The typical electrode resistance
was 2–5 MW, while access resistance was 3–8 MW. Series
resistance compensation was routinely used (‡40%). With
a holding potential of À50 mV, voltage-clamp experiments were governed by pClamp software, operating via
an interface (Digidata 1200, Axon Instruments, Foster
City, Calif., USA). For all recordings the following solutions were used. (1) Extracellular solution (mM): NaCl,
112; CsCl, 4; KCl, 1; HEPES, 10; dextrose, 10, MgCl2, 1;
CaCl2, 5.0; tetrodotoxin (TTX), 0.001; tetraethylammonium (TEA-Cl), 20; 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), 6; pH 7.35
with NaOH. (2) Intracellular solution: Cs-gluconate, 85;
Cs3-citrate, 10; NaCl, 10; KCl, 1; EGTA. 1.1; CaCl2, 0.1;
MgCl2, 0.25; HEPES, 10; TEA-Cl, 15; Mg-ATP, 3; Na2GTP, 0.5; pH 7.25 with CsOH. In one set of experiments
EGTA and CaCl2 were set to 5.5 and 0.5 mM, respectively. In some experiments EGTA and CaCl2 were removed from the pipette solution.
In a subset of experiments, peptides and puriﬁed
proteins were added to the internal solution using the
back-ﬁlling technique. According to [54] the calculated
rates of diﬀusional exchange between small cells and a
measuring patch pipette were: calmodulin binding domain (2.3 kDa) 2.4 min; lysozyme (12 kDa) 4.0 min;
parvalbumin (13 kDa) 4.2 min; calbindin (28 kDa)
5.4 min; calretinin (30 kDa) 5.6 min (assuming an
average access resistance of 5 MW and an average cell
capacitance of 14 pF). Puriﬁed Ca2+-binding proteins
and lysozyme were obtained from Swant and Sigma,
respectively.
The time course of inactivation of Ca2+ inward
currents was described by approximating the current
wave form to the function:
I ¼ A0 þ A1 Á e

Àst

þ A2 Á e

where amplitude coeﬃcients and time constants of current decay are A0–An and s1–sn, respectively. The inactivation ratio (Rinact) was calculated using the equation:
Rinact ¼

B1
B0

where B1 represents the current amplitude at the end of
the pulse and B0 the peak current amplitude (Fig. 1B,
inset) [32]. The degree of inactivation (Dinact; in percent;
see Fig. 1C, lower panel) during double-pulse protocols
was determined by using the following equation:

(lower panel) included to the pipette solution. Current traces

and 0 mV with Ca2+ and Ba2+ as charge carriers,
respectively) and C0 the peak of the post-pulse current
when the pre-pulse elicited no current (i.e. À40 mV).
The current/charge (I/Q) relationship was determined
by integrating Ca2+ inwards currents elicited by prepulses with respect to time and plotting the calculated
charge as functions of the peak amplitude of the corresponding post-pulse. Results are presented as means±SEM. Substance eﬀects were tested for signiﬁcance
using a modiﬁed t-test for small samples [16]. Diﬀerences
were considered signiﬁcant if P<0.05.

to poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides or freely ﬂoating
thalamic slices (60 lm thick) were incubated in PBS (pH
7.4) containing 0.4% glutaraldehyde for 10 min. Preincubation with the appropriate normal serum (1 h, 10%
in PBS) was followed by the primary antiserum (18 h at
room temperature) against calmodulin (Calbiochm,
1:200), calbindin (Sigma, 1:1,000 for histochemistry,
1:2,000 for protein blots) calretinin (Swant, 1:3,000 for
histochemistry, 1:2,000 for protein blots), or parvalbumin (Swant, 1:1,000 for histochemistry, 1:750 for protein
blots). The primary antibodies were tagged by appropriate biotinylated secondary antisera (Vector Labs,
Burlingame, Calif., USA; BA-5000, 1.5 h, 1:200) followed by incubation with avidin-biotin-complexed
horseradish peroxidase (Vector Labs, PK 4000, 1:100,
1.5 h). Between steps, slides were rinsed 3 times in PBS.
Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 2% normal
serum, 0.3% Triton, 2% BSA. Peroxidase activity was

initiated by adding PBS containing 0.05% 3,3¢-diaminobenzidine, 0.01% H2O2, 0.02% (NH4)2Ni(SO4)2 and
0.025% CoCl2 resulting in an enhanced dark grey-toblack staining of positively labelled neurons. For slices
the intensifying step was not performed. After stopping
the reaction isolated cells and tissue were dehydrated
and cover-slipped in DePeX (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) mounting medium.
As a negative control, antibodies were preincubated
with the control antigen peptide supplied by the manufacturer. Under these conditions no positive immunological signal was detected. In addition, occlusion of the
primary antibody from the staining procedure revealed
no positive immunological signal. For each subtype
antibody reactions were repeated 4 times. One set of
sections was Nissl-stained and used to evaluate the
overall density of cells in dLGN tissue.
Western blotting procedures
Thalamic and skeletal muscle tissue extracted from Long
Evans rats at postnatal days (P)5, P10, P12, P13, P14,
P20 and P30 was homogenized in a buﬀer containing
1% 3-[(3-chloramidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-propansulphonate (CHAPS, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)
and a cocktail of protein inhibitors [calpain-I inhibitor,
calpain-II inhibitor, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulphonyl
ﬂuoride (PMSF) and aprotenin; Boehringer, Mannheim,
Germany]. Via centrifugation (10 min at 3,000 g) proteins were separated and determined according to
Bradford [8]. Protein samples of 50 or 100 lg were
lyophilized, dissolved in SDS-sample buﬀer and 50 mM
dithiothreitol added (calbindin, calretinin). For electrophoretic studies of parvalbumin, calbindin and calretinin
a 4–16% gradient tricine gel was used. After electrophoresis proteins were transferred for 14–16 h at
100 mA to nitrocellulose (0.45 lm, Schleicher and
Schuell; Dassel, Germany). Thereafter the transfer was
blocked with 0.2% Tween 20 and 1% BSA in TRISbuﬀered saline for 1 h.

(À40 to +60 mV, 10-mV increments) revealed the typical current/voltage (I/V) relationship for HVA Ca2+
currents in relay neurons (Fig. 1A, open circles).
Moreover, the peak amplitude of the analysing postpulse revealed an (inverted) U-shaped dependency on
the pre-pulse potential (Fig. 1A, closed circles), indicating CDI [42, 43]. The degree of inactivation (indicated by the double-headed arrow in Fig. 1C) averaged
34±9% (n=9; Fig. 2E). To obtain a more direct measure of the inﬂuence of Ca2+ inﬂux during the pre-pulse
on CDI, the I/Q curve was constructed and revealed a
sigmoidal dependency of the post-pulse amplitude on
Ca2+ inﬂux (Fig. 1D). With Ba2+ as main charge carrier
the HVA current activated rapidly and than inactivated
slowly (Fig. 1A inset). Long current traces (1.2 s) indicated a monoexponential decay with s1=832±46 ms
(data not shown) [42]. The inactivation ratio was
0.86±0.02 (n=18; Fig. 1B). Double-pulse protocols revealed a hyperpolarizing shift in the I/V relationship of
HVA current (Fig. 1A) and a reduction in the degree of
inactivation to 12±4% (n=6, Fig. 1A).
Since standard whole-cell patch-clamping is accompanied by altered Ca2+ binding conditions in the recorded neurons, we next tried to assess the basal degree
of CDI and the eﬀect of exogenous Ca2+ buﬀers. For
double-pulse protocols applied within the ﬁrst 90 s after
establishing the whole-cell conﬁguration, incomplete
equilibration between the pipette and the cytosol was
assumed [25], thereby giving a rough estimate of the
basal level of CDI. The mean degree of inactivation
under these conditions (39±6%, n=4; data not shown)
was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from recordings obtained
5–10 min after rupture of the cell membrane with zero
(38±2%, n=3; data not shown), 1.1 mM (34±4%,
n=8; Fig. 1C) or 5.5 mM (31±3, n=6; Fig. 1C) EGTA
added to the internal solution. For comparison, 11 mM
BAPTA as intracellular Ca2+ buﬀer signiﬁcantly reduced the degree of inactivation to 15±1% (n=8;
Fig. 1C). These data indicate that rather large changes
in the bulk intracellular Ca2+ binding capacity and kinetic are necessary to inﬂuence CDI under our experimental conditions.

Results
Inﬂuence of calmodulin on CDI
CDI of HVA currents
HVA Ca2+ currents were evoked in dLGN relay neurons by stepping the membrane potential for 200 ms
from À50 to +10 mV (Fig. 1B inset, black current
trace). The total HVA Ca2+ current activated rapidly
and then declined rapidly revealing an inactivation ratio
of 0.47±0.06 (n=22; Fig. 1B). Time constants of inactivation were derived from 1.2-s pulses and were characterized by a biexponential time course with s1=56±6
and s2=726±88 ms (n=7; data not shown) [42]. In
double-pulse experiments (see inset in Fig. 1A) performed under control conditions (Fig. 1C, 1.1 mM
EGTA) conditioning pre-pulses of increasing amplitude

Since calmodulin has been suggested as the sensor for
CDI [35, 53, 55, 65], the expression of calmodulin was
monitored in dLGN cells using an anti-calmodulin
antibody. A total of 238 cells comprising local interneurons and relay neurons were inspected. All cells were
identiﬁed through morphological criteria [49] and were
immunopositive for calmodulin (Fig. 2D).
To determine whether calmodulin is involved in CDI
in relay neurons, two well-known calmodulin inhibitors
were tested [14, 59]. Addition of the irreversible calmodulin antagonist phenoxybenzamine (20 lM) to the
bathing solution signiﬁcantly increased the peak amplitude of HVA Ca2+ current by 53±12% (n=10; Fig. 2E

inset). The degree of inactivation seen in double-pulse
protocols (Fig. 2B) was signiﬁcantly reduced to 22±2%
(n=5; Fig. 2E) and the inactivation ratio was 0.81±0.02
(n=5). A similar eﬀect was evoked by intracellular
application of the calmodulin binding domain of CaMK
II (200 lM), a potent calmodulin inhibitor [52]. The
peak amplitude of HVA Ca2+ currents signiﬁcantly increased about 4 min after establishing of the whole-cell
recording by 32±2% (n=7; Fig. 2E inset). Doublepulse protocols under these conditions (Fig. 2C) revealed a signiﬁcantly reduced degree of inactivation
(17±1%, n=7; Fig. 2E), corresponding to an inactivation ratio of 0.86±0.04 (n=3). Taken together, these
results indicate the involvement of calmodulin in CDI in
relay neurons.

studies determining the expression of calbindin-D28K
(CB), calretinin (CR) and parvalbumin (PV) were performed on dLGN slices (60 lm thick sections from 14to 21-day-old rats). Alternate sections were Nissl-stained
and revealed an overall density of neurons in the dLGN
of 5,434±326 cells/mm2 (measured in six slices from
three animals).
Western blot analysis of dLGN tissue using a CBspeciﬁc antibody revealed a band of 28 kDa present
throughout postnatal development (Fig. 3A). In dLGN
slices, CB-immunoreactive cells were found at a density
of 183±41 cells/mm2 (n=3), indicating that about 3%
of neurons in dLGN express CB. Among the CB-positive structures small (soma diameter 8–12 lm) bipolar
cells (Fig. 3A) and, to a much lesser extent, large (soma
diameter 15–25 lm) multipolar cells could be identiﬁed,
most likely representing interneurons and relay neurons,
respectively [21, 24, 48].
In Western blots CR was represented by a band of
30 kDa and was present from P5 to P30 in the dLGN
(Fig. 3A). After immunohistochemistry, CR-labelled
neurons were found at a density of 488±32 cells/mm2

Ca2+-binding proteins: expression in the dLGN
and inﬂuence on CDI
Next, the expression and eﬀects of endogenous Ca2+binding proteins were analysed. Immunohistochemical

116

(n=3 slices), indicating that about 9% of dLGN neurons express CR. Size and shape of CR-positive cells
were indicative of interneurons (Fig. 3A).
PV expression was monitored in the dLGN in comparison to skeletal muscle tissue, which is known to
express high concentrations of PV [5]. In dLGN, PV
displayed a molecular mass of 13 kDa, identical to that
in muscle (Fig. 3A). In comparison to PV in skeletal
muscle tissue, levels of PV in dLGN were low but
detectable throughout postnatal development. Following immunohistochemistry, ﬁbres and neurons were
positively stained for PV. Size and shape of PV-positive
cells were typical of relay neurons (Fig. 3A). Analysis of
PV expression in dLGN slices and thalamic cell cultures
(data not shown) indicated that 79±1% (a total of 1687
cells were counted on seven diﬀerent slides) of thalamic
cells and 100% of cultured relay neurons (a total of 49
relay neurons were identiﬁed in 12 diﬀerent cultures)
were PV positive, respectively. Taken together, these
ﬁndings indicate that all three Ca2+-binding proteins are
expressed in dLGN tissue at the ages used for electrophysiological recordings.
To determine whether Ca2+-binding proteins expressed in dLGN modulate CDI, puriﬁed CB, CR and
PV (1 lM each) were co-infused into relay neurons using
the back-ﬁlling technique. The HVA Ca2+ current increased signiﬁcantly (by 90±6%, n=4) within 5–10 min
after establishing the whole-cell conﬁguration (Fig. 3C
inset, left panel). The ﬁnal inactivation ratio was
0.76±0.06 (n=3; data not shown). When double-pulse
protocols were delivered under these conditions, there
was a signiﬁcant reduction in the degree of inactivation
to 21±1% (n=4; data not shown).
The eﬀect of each Ca2+-binding protein was then
investigated separately. In general, the eﬀect of Ca2+binding proteins may result from an increase in intracellular Ca2+-binding capacity or Ca2+ signalling to
intracellular target molecules. PV is believed to serve
solely as a Ca2+ buﬀer [18]. First, puriﬁed PV (3 lM)
was added to the pipette solution and applied using the
back-ﬁlling technique. The eﬀect on HVA Ca2+ current
amplitude and the degree of inactivation exerted by
double-pulse protocols were similar to the combined
eﬀect of all three Ca2+-binding proteins, with a 92±5%
(n=4; Fig. 3C inset) increase in current amplitude and a
signiﬁcant reduction in the degree of inactivation to
20±2% (n=4; Fig. 3C). In addition the inactivation
ratio as a measure of time-dependent inactivation was
increased to 0.81±0.01 (n=3). For comparison, either
CR (3 lM) or CB (3 lM) were added to the pipette
solution in separate sets of experiments and the degree of
inactivation was signiﬁcantly decreased for CB
(24±4%, n=4; Fig. 3C) but not CR (30±2%, n=3;
Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data indicate that rather
small increases in the amount of Ca2+-binding proteins
can reduce CDI signiﬁcantly in dLGN relay neurons.
To demonstrate that the eﬀects described above are a
consequence of Ca2+ binding rather than introduction
of a protein per se, lysozyme (3 lM) was added to the

pipette solution. Lysozyme (12 kDa) is similar in size to
PV (13 kDa) but does not bind Ca2+ eﬀectively [12].
Following introduction of lysozyme into relay neurons,
peak HVA Ca2+ current amplitude was stable with time
and the degree of CDI (33±1%, n=4; Fig. 3C) was not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from control cells.
Relay neurons express a set of at least four diﬀerent
HVA Ca2+ current components, namely L-, N-, P/Qand R-type, of which only L- and Q-type currents are
governed by CDI [42, 43]. We therefore tried to assess
the contribution L- and N-type currents, as prototypical
CDI-sensitive and CDI-insensitive components, respectively, to the eﬀects of Ca2+-binding proteins. Under
control conditions the degree of inactivation was reduced signiﬁcantly to 19±1% (n=8; Fig. 3B,D) during
application of nifedipine (1 lM), an L-type-speciﬁc
blocker, but unchanged (32±1%, n=7; Fig. 3B,D) by
application of x-conotoxin GVIA (1 lM), an N-typespeciﬁc blocker. PV (3 lM) was then applied to relay
neurons via the recording pipette in the presence of
subtype-speciﬁc blockers. Under these conditions the
degree of inactivation was signiﬁcantly reduced in the
presence of x-conotoxin GVIA (21±4%, n=3;
Fig. 3B,D) but remained unchanged in the presence of
nifedipine (18±4%, n=4; Fig. 3B,D). From these data
it can be concluded that CDI of L-type Ca2+ channels is
inhibited by rather small increases in intracellular PV
concentration.
Action of agents interfering with the cytoskeleton
To test the role of the cytoskeleton in CDI, agents that
act on microﬁlament (phalloidin and cytochalasin) and
microtubule (taxol and colchicine) components of the
cytoskeleton were applied. When the cytoskeletal stabilizers taxol (2 lM) and phalloidin (100 lM) were both
added to the pipette solution, the degree of CDI was
signiﬁcantly reduced to 13±3% (n=4; Fig. 4B,E), corresponding to an inactivation ratio of 0.8±0.01 (n=4).
When applied separately, phalloidin and taxol reduced
CDI to 23±5% (n=4; Fig. 4C,E) and 15±3% (n=4;
Fig. 4D,E), corresponding to inactivation ratios of
0.79±0.04 (n=4) and 0.88±0.01 (n=4), respectively. In
contrast, the cytoskeletal disrupters colchicine (100 lM)
and cytochalasin B (50 lM) had no signiﬁcant eﬀect on
the degree of CDI (n=4; Fig. 4A,E), as conﬁrmed by an
inactivation ratio of 0.54±0.02 (n=4). No changes in
holding current or membrane resistance were observed
during application of cytoskeletal agents. These data
indicated that agents interfering with the normal ability
of the cytoskeleton for self-sustained reconstruction reduce CDI.

relay neurons displays several characteristics of a

more eﬀective than Ba2+. Third, introduction of Ca2+
buﬀers reduced CDI signiﬁcantly.
The role of Ca2+-binding proteins
It has been shown previously that the introduction of
exogenous synthetic Ca2+ chelators into relay neurons
reduces CDI [42]. Here we extend this ﬁnding by demonstrating that puriﬁed Ca2+-binding proteins aﬀect
CDI diﬀerently in these cells. While PV and CB reduced
CDI signiﬁcantly, CR had no eﬀect. It is interesting to
note that PV, the expression of which was demonstrated
in relay neurons, exerts the strongest eﬀect on CDI. The
action of PV is most likely based on Ca2+ buﬀering, as
PV is generally seen as a pure Ca2+ buﬀer [18]. Since CB
and CR are believed to also function as Ca2+ signalling
proteins [22, 27, 40], the mode of action of CB may be
diﬀerent. In any case, the eﬀectiveness of low concentrations (3 lM) of PV and CB indicates that these proteins reach suﬃciently high levels around the point of

Ca2+ entry to buﬀer entering Ca2+ eﬀectively and is
even consistent with a close physical association between
PV and/or CB and Ca2+ channels. In this respect it is
interesting to note that other EF-hand Ca2+-binding
proteins (calmodulin, sorcin) have been shown to associate tightly with Ca2+ and K+ channels [20, 38, 44].
Furthermore, the ﬁnding that rather small amounts of
Ca2+-binding proteins are suﬃcient to disrupt CDI
eﬀectively has been described before in hippocampal
granule cells, where a low concentration (20 lM) of
exogenous CB substantially reduces this type of feedback coupling [46].
Due to their ability to buﬀer intracellular free Ca2+
eﬀectively during neuronal excitation [17], Ca2+-binding proteins are also expected to be neuroprotective
[63]. The ﬁnding of an activity-dependent expression of
PV [51] and CB [3] indicates a positive feedback
between these two functions. It should be pointed out,
however, that down-regulation of Ca2+-binding
proteins can also act in a neuroprotective manner, as
indicated in surviving granule cells of the sclerotic
human hippocampus where the loss of CB reduces the
amount of Ca2+ inﬂux since the process of CDI is fully
active under these conditions [46]. These ﬁndings

119

indicate a complex correlation between the content of
calcium-binding proteins and activity-dependent
neuronal vulnerability.
The introduction of exogenous Ca2+ buﬀers via the
recording pipette raises the question as to the degree of
CDI under basal physiological conditions. The ﬁnding
that the percentage of CDI shortly after rupture of the
cell membrane, under EGTA-free conditions and in
the presence of 1.1 mM as well as 5.5 mM EGTA was
not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent may indicate that about 35
% inactivation may approximate the physiological
condition. Even large increases in the concentration of
EGTA, which does not interfere with Ca2+ diﬀusion
in channel-associated Ca2+ microdomains [47] were
not able to diminish CDI. This conclusion is corroborated by the ﬁnding that high concentrations of
BAPTA, which does interfere with Ca2+ microdomains [47], eﬀectively inhibit CDI. The action of low
concentrations of Ca2+-binding proteins is thus very
diﬀerent from that of high EGTA loads, thereby
supporting the conclusion of a close association of
Ca2+-binding proteins to the Ca2+ channel complex
and raising the possibility that small changes in protein
expression levels eﬀectively alter CDI. On the other
hand, the occurrence of prominent CDI in cells
expressing PV may indicate that endogenous Ca2+binding proteins play a minor role in CDI. Future
studies utilizing PV and CB knock-out mice, determining the Ca2+ binding ratio of relay neurons,
quantifying basal Ca2+ binding protein expression
levels and determining the spatial distance between
Ca2+ channels and Ca2+-binding proteins in these
neurons may help to clarify the role of ambient Ca2+
binding proteins in CDI. Determination of the basal
degree of CDI however will be complicated by the fact
that several pathways converge on this mechanism (see
below).
The role of calmodulin
There is a longstanding notion that the limiting action
of CDI on Ca2+ entry through HVA channels depends
on calmodulin. Originally, a mechanism involving
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activation of calcineurin
and subsequent dephosphorylation of HVA Ca2+
channel proteins was proposed [2]. More recent work
has elaborated the role of calmodulin as a Ca2+ sensor
that is bound constitutively to the channel protein and
regulates CDI and even VDI by inducing complex
conformational changes and utilizing the I-II linker as
a common blocking particle [20, 33]. In accordance
with these ﬁndings, blockers of calmodulin exerted a
pronounced inhibitory eﬀect on the degree of CDI in
relay neurons. It has been shown previously that
blockers of calcineurin also reduce CDI in relay neurons, thereby suggesting a role of channel dephosphorylation in this process [43]. The experimental
conditions used in the present study do not allow

discrimination between the two possible modes of
calmodulin action (i.e. direct action on the channel
protein or activation of calcineurin). The ﬁnding that
blockade of calmodulin exerts stronger eﬀects on CDI
than blockade of calcineurin [43] may indicate that
calmodulin acts through both mechanisms in dLGN
relay neurons.
Involvement of the cytoskeleton
The cytoskeleton is a ﬁlamentous network of F-actin,
microtubules and intermediate ﬁlaments and regulation
of transmembrane ion ﬂux is one of its important roles
in cell signalling [28]. Results obtained from experiments in molluscan neurons [29] and hippocampal
pyramidal neurons [30] have suggested that the cytoskeleton is involved in CDI. Although the transduction
mechanism coupling the cytoskeleton to CDI is not
fully understood and seems to diﬀer between diﬀerent
cell types, Ca2+-dependent destabilization of cytoskeletal elements that have a structural relationship to
the channel protein has been suggested [4]. Cytoskeletal stabilizers reduced CDI in relay neurons. The
microtubule stabilizer taxol was more eﬀective than the
microﬁlament stabilizer phalloidin, indicating that both
cytoskeletal components are not involved equally in
CDI. These data are in agreement with a model in
which microtubules stabilize a microﬁlament lattice,
with the latter probably binding directly to the Ca2+
channel complex [29, 30]. In this model the Ca2+
sensitivity of Ca2+ channels could be mediated by
cytoskeletal depolymerization, since both microtubule
and microﬁlament components of the cytoskeleton are
disrupted by increases in the [Ca2+]i. It is interesting
to note that a similar mechanism has been suggested
for the Ca2+-dependent reduction of NMDA receptor
activity [56]. More experiments will have to clarify the
uncoupling of CDI from Ca2+ entry during presence
of cytoskeletal stabilizers and corroborate the above
model in relay neurons.
Involvement of HVA Ca2+ channel subtypes
It is now recognized that CDI of L-type Ca2+ channels (CaV1.2) is based on the activation of preassociated calmodulin in response to Ca2+ entry and is
insensitive to the application of 10 mM BAPTA and
thus suitable for the detection of local Ca2+ entry [39,
53, 55, 65]. In contrast, P/Q-type channels (CaV2.1)
possess a mechanistically related process of inactivation that is highly sensitive to the application of
0.5 mM EGTA and thus suitable for the detection of
global Ca2+ entry [36, 39]. Other members of the
CaV2 family have been characterized as lacking or
inconsistently showing CDI (N-type channels; CaV2.2)
whilst R-type channels (CaV2.3) are basically devoid of
CDI [60]. In agreement with this classical view L- and

120

P/Q-type Ca2+ channels but not N- and R-type
channels have been found to be governed by CDI in
relay neurons [42, 43]. Furthermore the inactivation of
L-type, but not N-type, channels is inﬂuenced by
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation [43] and Ca2+binding proteins (present study). In contrast to this
classical view it has been recently demonstrated that
N- and R-type channels possess a CDI mechanism
very similar to that in P/Q-type channels [39]. In relay
neurons CDI of P/Q-type channels is not sensitive to
1.1 mM EGTA while CDI of L-type channels is substantially blocked by 11 mM BAPTA [42]. Phenomena
like clustering of Ca2+ channels which can lead to
overlapping Ca2+ microdomains may obscure the
strict segregation of local and global Ca2+ signalling
and explain this discrepancy [6, 58].
Integrated view of CDI mechanisms and possible
functional relevance
Diﬀerent mechanisms underlying CDI have been
described independently in diﬀerent cell types [11].
Combining all experimental data of CDI in identiﬁed
relay neurons [42, 43] (present study), it can be
concluded for the ﬁrst time that this feedback mechanism does not depend solely on a single process.
Indeed, there is evidence for the involvement of
calmodulin, several protein phosphatases and kinases,
intracellular Ca2+-binding proteins and the cytoskeleton, thereby indicating that a speciﬁc cell type can
combine various mechanisms, highlighting the importance of this negative feedback signalling and pointing
to an integrated model of CDI that has recently been
suggested [11, 50].
HVA Ca2+ channels and thus CDI are relevant
features during the tonic mode of activity and highthreshold oscillations in relay neurons [50]. Ca2+ entry
during tonic ﬁring thus serves to activate further release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores [10], CDI [43]
and Ca2+-dependent K+ channels [7], thereby sustaining and shaping the processing of sensory information from the periphery to cortical structures.
Furthermore, restriction of Ca2+ entry by CDI may be
neuroprotective [13] and even life-sustaining [1]. The
multitude of converging mechanisms in relay neurons
oﬀers multiple opportunities for modulating CDI,
including the inhibition of CDI by the cAMP/PKA
system [43]. This system is activated readily in relay
neurons by transmitters (noradrenaline, serotonin) of
the ascending brainstem system during wakefulness
[41], thereby potentially strengthening the interplay
between Ca2+ entry via HVA channels and intracellular Ca2+ stores that supports the relay mode. Future
studies will have to unravel the diﬀerent modulatory
pathways that act upstream from the multiple CDI
mechanisms thereby pointing to additional functions of
CDI and unravelling further the elusive role of HVA
Ca2+ channels in thalamic physiology.

he Ca2+ channels encoded by the CaV3 genes activate near
resting membrane potentials and generate low-threshold Ca2+
spikes leading to burst ﬁring and low-frequency oscillatory discharge that are prominent in some thalamic, olivary, and cerebellar
neurons (1). Among the low-threshold Ca2+ currents carried by
CaV3 channels, those mediated by CaV3.3 channels are unique in
that they display the slowest time course, the fastest recovery from
inactivation, and often the most depolarized activation voltages (2,
3). Moreover, CaV3.3 mRNA is expressed predominantly in brain
and shows highest regional speciﬁcity (3–5). To date, identiﬁcation
of speciﬁc physiological roles for CaV3.3 channels has been hampered for several reasons. First, these channels typically are
coexpressed with CaV3.1 and/or CaV3.2 channels (4, 5), and speciﬁc pharmacological tools are not available (1). Second, CaV3.3
channels often are found in distal dendrites, limiting accessibility
for electrophysiological characterization (6, 7). Finally, CaV3.3−/−
mice have not been reported, whereas CaV3.1−/− and CaV3.2
knockdown mice have helped address the roles of CaV3.1 and
CaV3.2 channels in sleep and pain, respectively (8–10).
In the thalamus, CaV3.3 mRNA and protein are abundant in
GABAergic cells of the surrounding nucleus reticularis thalami
(nRt), the principal source of inhibition to relay nuclei, whereas

T

excitatory thalamocortical (TC) neurons are not immunopositive
for CaV3.3 (4, 5, 11). The slow decay and the depolarized activation range of low-threshold Ca2+ currents in the nRt (12) are
thought to reﬂect the dominant mRNA expression of CaV3.3 over
CaV3.2 channels (5, 7, 13). Vigorous bursting properties in nRt
underlie its well-documented role in pacemaking sleep spindles
(14) and its proposed involvement in attentional gating mechanisms (15). Therefore, the nRt is ideally suited to explore the
cellular and circuit roles of CaV3.3 channels.
Here, we describe the CaV3.3−/− mouse and report that CaV3.3
channels are required for nRt cell bursting and for synchronized
rhythmicity in intrathalamic circuits. CaV3.3−/− mice show selectively weakened spindle wave generation during spontaneous
sleep. These results establish a speciﬁc role for CaV3.3 channels in
a sleep EEG hallmark and, more generally, an animal model to
provide insight into sleep’s role for the brain.
Results
Generation of CaV3.3−/− Mice. Interruption of the CaV3.3 gene

was achieved through homologous recombination in 129Ola ES
cells. The targeting construct deleted a 6.8-kb genomic region
(National Center for Biotechnology Information m37 15:80,198,
299-80,205,160) encoding exons 11–21, replacing them with a
β-galactosidase–neomycin cassette (Fig. 1A). The engineered
allele deletes the coding sequence between the predicted IIS2 and
IIIS4 transmembrane regions, including the third predicted intracellular domain (3). Additionally, exons 10 and 22 are out of
the translational reading frame; therefore, any truncated protein
product will not be functional. CaV3.3 gene deletion was conﬁrmed by RT-PCR experiments using RNA extracted from cerebellum, olfactory bulb, cortex, and thalamus (Fig. 1B). The
deletion of the CaV3.3 gene did not affect transcription of the
CaV3.2 gene in thalamus, as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR
(Fig. 1C). For all experiments described below, mouse genotype
was determined by PCR (Fig. 1D), and homozygous CaV3.3−/−
and WT littermates were used.

Low-threshold (T-type) Ca2+ channels encoded by the CaV3 genes
endow neurons with oscillatory properties that underlie slow
waves characteristic of the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep
EEG. Three CaV3 channel subtypes are expressed in the thalamocortical (TC) system, but their respective roles for the sleep EEG are
unclear. CaV3.3 protein is expressed abundantly in the nucleus reticularis thalami (nRt), an essential oscillatory burst generator. We report the characterization of a transgenic CaV3.3−/− mouse line and
demonstrate that CaV3.3 channels are indispensable for nRt function and for sleep spindles, a hallmark of natural sleep. The absence
of CaV3.3 channels prevented oscillatory bursting in the lowfrequency (4–10 Hz) range in nRt cells but spared tonic discharge.
In contrast, adjacent TC neurons expressing CaV3.1 channels retained low-threshold bursts. Nevertheless, the generation of synchronized thalamic network oscillations underlying sleep-spindle
waves was weakened markedly because of the reduced inhibition
of TC neurons via nRt cells. T currents in CaV3.3−/− mice were <30%
compared with those in WT mice, and the remaining current, carried by CaV3.2 channels, generated dendritic [Ca2+]i signals insufﬁcient to provoke oscillatory bursting that arises from interplay with
Ca2+-dependent small conductance-type 2 K+ channels. Finally, naturally sleeping CaV3.3−/− mice showed a selective reduction in the
power density of the σ frequency band (10–12 Hz) at transitions
from NREM to REM sleep, with other EEG waves remaining unaltered. Together, these data identify a central role for CaV3.3 channels in the rhythmogenic properties of the sleep-spindle generator
and provide a molecular target to elucidate the roles of sleep spindles for brain function and development.

were generated upon depolarization from the resting membrane
potential of −70 mV (16). In contrast, in nRt cells from CaV3.3−/−
mice, repetitive burst discharges were absent, whereas tonic ﬁring
was unaltered (Fig. 2A and Table S1). Passive membrane properties did not differ between genotypes (P > 0.05 in all cases) (Fig.
2B1). Additionally, no difference was observed in inwardly rectifying currents (P > 0.05) (Fig. 2B2) (17).
We next attempted to facilitate rhythmic bursting by imposing
transient hyperpolarizations from more depolarized membrane
potentials (Fig. 2 C–F). Low-threshold Ca2+ spikes could be
elicited in CaV3.3−/− nRt cells that were depolarized beyond −60
mV before transient hyperpolarization; however, the number of
Ca2+ spikes was reduced markedly compared with WT cells (e.g.,
at −55 mV, 4.9 ± 0.6 in WT, n = 8, vs. 1.6 ± 0.2 in CaV3.3−/−, n =
13; P < 0.01) (Fig. 2 D and E). Moreover, CaV3.3−/− cells typically generated a single low-threshold Ca2+ spike crowned with
action potentials (APs), whereas APs were triggered for several
Ca2+ spikes in WT cells (Fig. 2D). Finally, the number of APs
generated by the ﬁrst Ca2+ spike was diminished markedly (e.g.,
at −55 mV, 3.6 ± 0.5 in WT vs. 1.5 ± 0.4 in CaV3.3−/−; P < 0.01)
(Fig. 2F). Indeed, in 7 of 13 cells, only a single or no AP could be
elicited across the range of voltages tested, indicating that fullﬂedged burst discharge failed. The rebound depolarization observed in CaV3.3−/− cells was blocked by low Ni2+ concentrations
(50–100 μM in bath) (Fig. S1), indicating that a T-type conductance remained. Similar discharge deﬁcits were found in 10-wk-old
animals (Fig. S2).

In contrast to the drastic reduction of bursting in nRt cells,
T channel-mediated burst discharge was preserved in TC cells
principally expressing CaV3.1 channels, and low-threshold Ca2+
spikes were crowned by a comparable number of APs (Fig.
3 A–C).
Inhibitory synaptic output from bursting nRt cells is important
for rebound burst generation in connected TC cells. To test
whether the absence of CaV3.3 channels affected nRt-mediated
inhibition of TC cells, we recorded synaptic responses in voltageclamped TC cells evoked by stimulating excitatory afferents onto
nRt cells (6). In WT mice, synaptic responses typically appeared
as multipeak events with an interpeak interval of 4.2 ± 0.5 ms (in
six of seven cells) that is characteristic for the high-frequency

bursts of nRt cells (Fig. 3D1). In contrast, in CaV3.3−/− mice,
multiple peaks appeared rarely (in two of six cells). As a result,
the inhibitory driving force onto TC cells was signiﬁcantly
smaller in CaV3.3−/− mice, as determined from the integral of
synaptic currents evoked by increasing stimulus intensities (e.g.,
with 250-μA stimulus intensity: 26 ± 5 pC in WT mice vs. 10 ± 4
pC in CaV3.3−/− mice; P < 0.05) (Fig. 3D2).
To investigate the effects of reduced nRt inhibitory drive on
intrathalamic circuitry involved in sleep spindles (18), we examined synchronized multiunit discharges in nRt elicited via
bipolar electrical stimulation of excitatory afferents in the adjacent internal capsule and perpetuated via reciprocal synaptic
interactions with TC cells. To facilitate network activity, we ﬁrst
perfused slices with artiﬁcial CSF (ACSF) containing increased
Ca2+ (3 mM) and decreased Mg2+ (0.5 mM). In WT mice, robust reverberating activity at 7–9 Hz lasting ∼1.5 s was elicited
(Fig. 3E). Similar activity was detected in slices from CaV3.3−/−
mice, but with weaker oscillatory strength (P < 0.05) and shorter
duration (P = 0.07) (Fig. 3 E and F). Notably, after returning to
normal divalent cation concentrations (2 mM Ca2+/1.2 mM

polarized voltage steps (1 s) from −100 mV using a ﬂuoridecontaining patch pipette solution (Fig. 4 and SI Materials and
Methods). Compared with WT cells, T-current density in CaV3.3−/−
nRt cells was reduced throughout the activation range (e.g., 78%
reduction at −70 mV; P < 0.01, and 54% reduction at −50 mV;
P < 0.01; n = 10 for WT and n = 8 for CaV3.3−/−) (Fig. 4A2).
Moreover, the activation curve was shifted toward more depolarized potentials in CaV3.3−/− mice (P < 0.01) (Fig. 4A3). Strikingly, T currents from CaV3.3−/− cells had a 2.5-fold faster decay
than WT cells (e.g., at −50 mV τw, decay = 96 ± 10 ms for WT
vs. τw, decay = 38 ± 6 ms for CaV3.3−/−; n = 10 and 8, respectively;
P < 0.01) (Fig. 4B). Similar alterations were found at nearphysiological temperature (Fig. S3). Notably, recovery from steadystate inactivation was retarded in CaV3.3−/− cells (time constant of
recovery: τw, rec = 1.5 ± 0.3 s for WT vs. τw, rec = 7.9 ± 2.3 s for
CaV3.3−/−; n = 10 and 8, respectively; P < 0.05) (Fig. 4C).
Pharmacological properties of T currents in WT and CaV3.3−/−
cells were compared for current block by Ni2+, which differs
between CaV3.2 and CaV3.3 channels (Fig. 4D) (19). In CaV3.3−/−
cells, T currents were strongly reduced with 50 μM Ni2+ (by 74 ±
7%; n = 6; P < 0.01), but 200 μM Ni2+ blocked T currents only
partially in WT cells (by 40 ± 5%; n = 6; P < 0.01), and a residual
current remained even with 500 μM Ni2+ (peak reduction: 60 ±
4%; n = 6; P < 0.01). Similar blockade was found with an intracellular solution that preserves cellular discharge properties
(Fig. S4). Additionally, low-threshold Ca2+ currents evoked in
CaV3.3−/− cells were invariant against the R-type channel blocker
SNX-482 (change by −1.0 ± 2.9%; n = 4, P > 0.05) (Fig. S4) at
doses that reduce R currents in nRt slices (20). Around resting
membrane potentials, low-threshold Ca2+ currents thus are carried dominantly by T channels in WT nRt cells and contain two
components with different Ni2+ sensitivity (13).
Elimination of Burst-Mediated Dendritic Ca2+ Signaling in CaV3.3−/−
Neurons. CaV3.3 channels have been implicated previously in

intracellular [Ca2+]i dynamics important for cellular rhythmicity
(16, 21). We performed ﬂuorescent imaging in cells infused with
the Ca2+-sensitive dye bis-fura-2 (1 mM) and focused on transients in dye-bound intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (Δ[Ca2+]i)
in nRt dendrites, which are essential for oscillatory bursting
(16). Fluorescent signals were collected from portions of dendritic arbors up to ∼200 μm from the cell body (Fig. 5 A and B).
In cells from WT mice, repetitive burst ﬁring induced by brief
hyperpolarizing steps evoked large Δ[Ca2+]i (Fig. 5A). In contrast, in cells from CaV3.3−/− mice, rebound ﬁring, even when
facilitated by prior membrane depolarization, produced only
a minor Δ[Ca2+]i, with peak amplitudes of Δ[Ca2+]i reduced
by ∼80% compared with WT (Fig. 5B). Tonic ﬁring elicited by
depolarizing steps evoked comparable Δ[Ca2+]i in both genotypes, indicating intact function of high-voltage–activated (HVA)
Ca2+ channels.
Coupling between T channels and Ca2+-dependent small conductance-type 2 K+ (SK2) channels in nRt dendrites underlies
oscillatory discharge of nRt cells (16). We used the SK channel
blocker apamin to assess whether the absence of CaV3.3 channels
disrupted this coupling, which manifests as a biphasic current
containing inward T- and outward SK2-current components (Fig.
5C) (16). Apamin-sensitive SK currents, obtained via digital subtraction of whole-cell currents in apamin from those in control

in WT vs. 185 ± 32 pA in CaV3.3−/−; n = 7 and 9, respectively; P >
0.05). Notably, the reduction (∼80%) in SK2 current was not in
proportion to the T-current amplitudes remaining in the CaV3.3−/−
nRt cells (∼40%) recorded for this series (average peak amplitude:
250 ± 117 pA in CaV3.3−/− vs. 591 ± 81 pA in WT). Therefore, to
obtain a coupling index, we quantiﬁed the ratio between the apamin-sensitive SK2 current and the net T current for every cell. This
ratio approached zero in CaV3.3−/− cells (0.5 ± 0.1 in WT vs. 0.03 ±
0.17 in CaV3.3−/−; P < 0.05). Thus, CaV3.3 channels are in13826 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1105115108

Impaired Spindle Generation During Natural Sleep in CaV3.3−/− Mice.

Repetitive nRt low-threshold bursting is vigorous during natural
sleep (14, 18). To test how the impaired activity of nRt cells in
CaV3.3−/− mice affected sleep physiology, we performed polysomnographic recordings in freely moving mice with chronically
implanted EEG and electromyography (EMG) electrodes (WT,
n = 8; CaV3.3−/−, n = 7). These recordings yielded the typical
non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep power spectrum dominated by a peak in the δ range (0.75–4 Hz) and a small contribution in the σ range (10–12 Hz), both of which were unaffected
by the absence of CaV3.3 channels (Fig. 6A). Because sleep
spindles contribute dominantly to the σ range at NREM-toREM sleep transitions but represent a minor component in the
spectral proﬁle of total time spent in NREM sleep (22), we next
focused on the surge of σ power (10–12 Hz) peaking ∼30 s before
REM sleep onset. This analysis has proven useful in assessing
deﬁcits related to nRt bursting (16, 23). Indeed, the surge in σ
power was reduced signiﬁcantly in CaV3.3−/− mice (at peak: WT,

absolute δ power baseline values were similar (WT, 24.6 ± 2.0

EEG frequency band.
Discussion
The present results demonstrate an obligatory role for CaV3.3
channels in burst discharge of cells in the nRt, a long-established
pacemaker element in the genesis of the EEG characteristics for
slow-wave sleep. We also identify CaV3.3 channels as the Ca2+
source necessary for dendritic Ca2+ transients and for the coupling to SK2 channels that underlies the oscillatory bursting of
nRt cells. Finally, CaV3.3 channels are essential for spindle
generation during natural sleep, with other frequency bands
remaining untouched. Together, the CaV3.3 channel represents
a speciﬁc molecular link between a special type of neuronal
discharge and an EEG hallmark of sleep.
The unique kinetic properties of CaV3.3-mediated currents (2,
3) made these channels candidates to underlie the strong burst
discharge properties of nRt cells (24). Several of our ﬁndings
now show directly that CaV3.3 channels in nRt mediate native
current characteristics. First, the absence of CaV3.3 channels
accelerated the decay of the remaining current, indicating that
the characteristic slow decay of whole-cell T currents in nRt is
dependent on CaV3.3 channels. Also, in CaV3.2−/− nRt cells
Astori et al.

recorded with similar intracellular recording solutions (13), decay
kinetics were comparable to the ones we obtained in WT cells.
Second, recovery from inactivation of the T current was slowed in
the absence of CaV3.3 channels, consistent with the rapid recovery
of cloned CaV3.3 channels (2). Finally, Ni2+ sensitivity was low in
the WT cells but increased dramatically in the absence of CaV3.3
channels, suggesting that a weakly Ni2+-sensitive Ca2+ current
dominates in WT, whereas a highly Ni2+-sensitive Ca2+ current
remained in the CaV3.3−/− nRt cells. This pharmacological proﬁle
points to a T-current component carried by CaV3.2 channels,
consistent with previous observations in CaV3.2−/− mice (13). We
found that CaV3.3 currents were largely responsible for cellular
bursting, for dendritic Ca2+ signals, and for the coupling to
SK2 channels, consistent with their predominant dendritic expression (11). However, network activity could be sustained in
CaV3.3−/− nRt cells, and whether CaV3.2 channel activity in nRt
contributes to and plays a role in the regulation of natural sleep is
not yet known.
Since Morison and Bassett’s original observation that spindle
oscillations in thalamus resist decortication (25), decades of research have established the recurrent thalamic circuits as their
site of origin (14). In contrast, how thalamic oscillators shape the
two other major NREM sleep frequency bands, the slow rhythm
(<1 Hz) and the δ waves (0.5–4 Hz), remains unknown, although
nRt bursting has been implicated (14, 26). In particular, δ waves
are suppressed in mice lacking either SK2- or KV3.1/3.3-type K+
channels, both of which are important for rhythmic bursting in
nRt (16, 27). The present results help clarify the intertwined
roles of cortical and thalamic oscillators in the sleep EEG. First,
they establish a speciﬁc role for nRt bursting as the core mechanism for spindle waves, thus providing a genetic basis for the
widely acknowledged unique standing of nRt in this characteristic sleep rhythm. The presence of CaV3.3 protein close to
asymmetric synapses (11) also underscores the fact that corticothalamic excitatory input can trigger local nRt bursting (6) and
recruit thalamus into large-scale brain oscillations (14). Second,
they demonstrate a minor role, if any, for nRt bursting in lowfrequency (<4 Hz) EEG waves of natural sleep, suggesting a
major cortical contribution to these rhythms. This result is consistent with the established cortical origin of slow rhythms (14)
but remains intriguing in the case of δ waves, for which nRt acts
as an intrathalamic synchronizing element (14). Monitoring intrathalamic and cortical activity during deep sleep will be required
to resolve the relation between thalamic and cortical contributions
to δ waves. It also must be considered that CaV3.2 and CaV3.3
channels are both expressed in cortex (4, 11), and the absence of
CaV3.3 channels from birth might alter cortical network activity
chronically. This alteration, in turn, can promote low-frequency
burst discharge in pyramidal neurons, perhaps by up-regulation of
CaV3.2 expression (28). Moreover, marked adaptive plasticity
occurs in nRt in response to cortical injury (17), leading to augmented excitatory input in uninjured corticothalamic ﬁbers. The
current results show that thalamic cellular properties, in particular
CaV3.2 channels in nRt, are largely spared from compensatory
alterations when CaV3.3 is removed, but compensations at synaptic and circuit levels remain to be explored.
Sleep spindles contribute to brain plasticity both in adulthood and
during development (29, 30). Spindle waves are implicated in sleepdependent memory consolidation by coordinating information
transfer from hippocampus to cortex (29). Moreover, mimicking
spindle activity in cortical cells promotes associative synaptic plasticity (31). In the developing brain, local cortical spindles probably
involving thalamus are the ﬁrst indications of synchronized network
activity (30). Further analysis of the CaV3.3−/− mouse undoubtedly
will be essential in delineating the role of thalamically generated
spindles in these diverse brain processes.

Materials and Methods
Generation of CaV3.3−/− Mice. Gene targeting was performed in E14.1 129O1a
ES cells, replacing exons 11–21 of the CaV3.3 gene with the expression/selection cassette indicated in Fig. 1. For target construction, the 5′ and 3′
homology arms (∼5.1 kb XhoI and ∼4.5 kb EcoRV/BamHI restriction fragments, respectively) were cloned from a 129SVJ genomic BAC library and
placed on either side of the expression/selection cassette shown in Fig. 1.
Homologous recombination in G418-resistant ES cells at the 5′ and 3′ ends
of the target locus was determined by Southern blot of EcoRV (WT 17 kb/
mutant 10 kb) and EcoRI (WT 17 kb/mutant 8 kb) digested ES cell genomic
DNA, respectively, using external probes. The PGK Neo MC1 tk selection
cassette was removed by transient pCAG-Cre transfection of targeted cells
followed by selection with gancyclovir (2 μM). Targeted ES cell clones were
injected into C57BL/6J-derived blastocysts. Male chimaeras were crossed with
C57BL/6J females to produce N1F0 offspring, which were backcrossed into
the C57BL/6J line for seven generations and further intercrossed to produce
homozygous mutant mice (CaV3.3−/−). Details of genotyping and RT-PCR are
given in SI Materials and Methods.
Electrophysiology and Fluorescent Imaging. For whole-cell patch clamp
recordings and ﬂuorescent Ca2+ imaging in nRt cells, horizontal slices 300 μm
thick were prepared from 3- to 4-wk-old and 8- to 10-wk-old CaV3.3−/− mice
and WT littermates, as previously described (16). For extracellular multiunit
recordings, slices 400 μm thick were prepared from 6- to 8-wk-old mice and
maintained in an interface-style recording chamber at near-physiological temperature (30–32 °C). Details of electrophysiological recording conditions, ﬂuorescence imaging, and data acquisition and analysis are given in SI Materials
and Methods.

were implanted with EEG and EMG electrodes according to standard
procedures (16). CaV3.3−/− mice showed comparable locomotor activity
across the 24-h light-dark cycle (Fig. S5). Under deep ketamine/xylazine
anesthesia (i.p., 100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively, at a volume of 8 μL/
g), six gold-plated miniature screws (1.1-mm diameter) were implanted into
the skull. The two screws placed over the right frontal and right parietal
cortex served as EEG electrodes. For EMG measurements, two semirigid
gold wires were inserted into the neck muscles, and all electrodes were
soldered to a connector. The construct was ﬁxed to the skull using the four
additional screws and sealed with dental cement. After 4–7 d of recovery
from surgery, animals were tethered to the recording leads and a commutator (Dragonﬂy). Four or ﬁve additional days were allowed for habituation. Undisturbed sleep–wake behavior was recorded for 48 h. Further
details of recording, scoring, and data analysis are given in SI Materials
and Methods.
Statistical Analysis. Data are presented in all ﬁgures as mean ± SEM. A paired
or unpaired Student’s t test was used as appropriate with signiﬁcance accepted for P < 0.05.

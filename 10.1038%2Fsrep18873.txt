State-dependent and cell
type-specific temporal processing
in auditory thalamocortical circuit
Shuzo Sakata
Ongoing spontaneous activity in cortical circuits defines cortical states, but it still remains unclear how
cortical states shape sensory processing across cortical laminae and what type of response properties
emerge in the cortex. Recording neural activity from the auditory cortex (AC) and medial geniculate
body (MGB) simultaneously with electrical stimulations of the basal forebrain (BF) in urethaneanesthetized rats, we investigated state-dependent spontaneous and auditory-evoked activities in
the auditory thalamocortical circuit. BF stimulation induced a short-lasting desynchronized state, with
sparser firing and increased power at gamma frequency in superficial layers. In this desynchronized
state, the reduction in onset response variability in both AC and MGB was accompanied by cell typespecific firing, with decreased responses of cortical broad spiking cells, but increased responses of
cortical narrow spiking cells. This onset response was followed by distinct temporal evolution in AC,
with quicker rebound firing in infragranular layers. This temporal profile was associated with improved
processing of temporally structured stimuli across AC layers to varying degrees, but not in MGB. Thus,
the reduction in response variability during the desynchronized state can be seen subcortically whereas
the improvement of temporal tuning emerges across AC layers, emphasizing the importance of statedependent intracortical processing in hearing.
Neocortical circuits show coordinated activity even in the absence of sensory inputs and this coordinated spontaneous activity defines cortical states1–3. In one extreme, a “synchronized” state during slow-wave sleep is characterized by slow fluctuations between synchronous and silent population activity, respectively called UP and DOWN
states/phases4. On the other hand, a “desynchronized” state during attentive state and rapid eye movement sleep
is characterized by tonic desynchronized activity5.
These cortical states can affect the sensory response properties in many facets2,6–12. This includes response
amplitudes6,11,13, the size of receptive fields14–17, and noise correlations between pairs of neurons18,19. As cortical
neurons are highly heterogeneous across cortical layers20,21, the effects of cortical states are also heterogeneous
depending on cell classes: with respect to spontaneous activity, different cortical states can be characterized by
diverse spontaneous firing across cortical cell types and layers in the barrel22,23, auditory24,25 and visual cortices8,13,26.
While patterns of sensory evoked activities differ across cortical layers regardless of cortical states23,27–29, our
understanding of state-dependent and cell type-specific sensory processing is still incomplete.
In the auditory system, although previous studies have shown that auditory evoked responses in AC are dependent upon brain state9,16,24,30–33, little is known about cell type or laminar specificity of state-dependent temporal
tuning in AC despite the fact that temporal processing is critical for speech recognition34 and that impairments
in temporal processing have been associated with dyslexia35 and aging36. Moreover, it still remains elusive as to
what extent state dependence of auditory responses in AC is inherited from subcortical areas, such as the medial
geniculate body (MGB).
Here we adopted in vivo large-scale extracellular recording from both AC and MGB simultaneously with
electrical stimulations of the basal forebrain (BF) in urethane-anesthetized rats. Electrical stimulation of BF has
been applied in studies of the visual cortex8 and offers an excellent experimental model to systematically assess
state-dependent neural responses. Although BF stimulation has been applied to induce cortical plasticity in AC
over the past decades37,38, only a few studies39 have investigated state-dependent auditory processing with this paradigm. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study assessed cell type-specific firing across cortical

layers using this paradigm. In the present study, we report that AC and MGB are similar in terms of the reduction
in spike count variability at stimulus onset during the desynchronized state while cortical narrow spiking cells
show increased spike rate. Importantly, AC shows distinct response dynamics, with quicker rebound firing during
the desynchronized state. This temporal profile was further associated with improved processing of temporally
structured stimuli across AC layers to varying degrees, but not in MGB.

Results

We monitored spontaneous and evoked neural population activity from the auditory cortex (AC) and the medial
geniculate body (MGB) simultaneously in urethane-anesthetized rats (n =  5) using linear silicon probes (Fig. 1a).
To induce a desynchronized state, the basal forebrain (BF) was electrically stimulated (Fig. 1b). The effect of BF
stimulation typically lasted for up to 10 sec. By employing a block design (Fig. 1c), we systematically assessed
state-dependent auditory evoked population activity in the auditory thalamocortical circuit. In addition to cortical
local field potentials (LFPs) (see below), 151 cortical and 74 thalamic cells were analyzed as single units. To evaluate
laminar-dependent effects, cortical cells were further classified into 5 types by assessing spike waveforms and estimating the depth of recorded single units based on spike waveforms and the depth profile of current source density
(Fig. 2) (see Methods): narrow spiking (NS) cells (n =  21) and 4 types of broad spiking (BS) cells (BS1, 0 ~ 200 μ m,

horizontal limb of the diagonal band, and the magnocellular preoptic nucleus (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1).

Laminar-dependent effects of BF stimulation on cortical local field potentials.  To characterize

the induced desynchronized state, we began with investigating relationships between cortical states and cortical
LFPs across cortical layers (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3a,b, we compared the depth profile of power spectral densities (PSD)
in AC before and after BF stimulations (n =  21). Before BF stimulations (Fig. 3a), larger signals at delta frequency
(≤4 Hz) were observed particularly in deep channels whereas beta (12–30 Hz) frequency was relatively prominent around presumptive thalamic recipient layers compared to other layers. After BF stimulations (Fig. 3b),
the delta component in deep layers decreased whereas the low gamma (30–50 Hz) component increased in presumptive thalamic recipient and supragranular layers (Fig. 3b). This pattern was consistently observed across
five experiments (Fig. 3c). In deep layers, effects of BF stimulations were significant across all frequency components assessed (0–4 Hz, F1,464 =  783, p <  0.0001; 4–8 Hz, F1,464 =  416, p <  0.0001; 8–12 Hz, F1,464 =  158, p <  0.0001;
12–30 Hz, F1,464 =  25.66, p <  0.0001; 30–50 Hz, F1,464 =  7.89, p <  0.005, two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey’s
honest significant different (HSD) test). In superficial layers, low frequency components (up to 12 Hz) were
decreased (0–4 Hz, p <  0.0001; 4–8 Hz, p <  0.0001; 8–12 Hz, p <  0.0001) whereas low gamma component was
significantly increased by BF stimulations (p <  0.0001). These results suggest layer-specific effects of cortical states
on network activity in AC.

Laminar-dependent effects of BF stimulation on thalamocortical spontaneous activity.  Next,

we characterized state-dependent spontaneous firing in AC and MGB neurons (Fig. 4). Figure 4a shows examples of two cortical neurons whose spontaneous firing was differently modulated by BF stimulation. Typically
superficial neurons showed decreased firing in the induced desynchronized state whereas many infragranular
neurons exhibited continuous firing, resulting in increased firing, generally consistent with a previous report
with electrical stimulation of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus under anesthesia and also with results
in unanesthetized rats25. To quantify this tendency, firstly we compared mean firing rate across cell classes during the synchronized state (i.e., before BF stimulation) (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table S1). BS1 and BS4 cell
groups showed significantly lower firing rate compared to other cortical cell groups (p <  0.0005, Kruskal-Wallis
test). This trend became stronger during the desynchronized state (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table S2). Mean
firing rate in BS1 and BS4 cell groups was significantly lower than other groups including MGB cells (p <  0.0001,

Kruskal-Wallis test). Next, we assessed the effect of state changes computing a modulation index (see Methods)
(Fig. 4d). BS1 and B4 cell groups significantly decreased their firing rate after BF stimulations (BS1, p <  0.005;
BS4, p <  0.05, signed rank test with Bonferroni correction). Other cell classes showed diverse effects. These results
indicate state-dependent and cell type-specific spontaneous firing in the auditory thalamocortical circuit. To further ask whether the desynchronized state can explain as a continuous UP state, we compared firing rate between
both conditions (Fig. 4e). Again, BS1 and BS4 cells showed a significant reduction in their firing rate during the
desynchronized state (BS1, p <  0.005; BS4, p <  0.05, signed rank test with Bonferroni correction), suggesting that
the desynchronized state differs from UP state of the synchronized state, with respect to suprathreshold spiking
activity across cortical layers.
Both states were also characterized by measuring pairwise spike count correlations across recorded neurons
(Fig. 4f–h and Supplementary Tables 3–5). The desynchronized state was associated with significantly lower
correlations only in cortical cell pairs (F2,8806 =  46.2, p <  0.0001, two-way ANOVA with HSD test), and not in
thalamic pairs (p =  0.41) or corticothalamic pairs (p =  0.25) (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Table 3). While a significant reduction in correlations can be observed across three different combinations of cortical cells (F2,4590 =  3.86,

cell pairs showed the reduction in spike count correlations (F2,2628 =  13.7, p <  0.0001), but not in NS-MGB cell
pairs (p =  0.32) (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Table 5). Thus, cortical states are characterized by diverse, but cell
type-specific population firing.

Effects of cortical state on onset responses to auditory click stimulus.  To investigate how cortical
states shape auditory evoked responses to a simple stimulus, single clicks were presented during the synchronized
and desynchronized states. 130 cortical and 70 thalamic neurons that showed spiking (0 to 100 ms from onset)
in both states were included for the following analysis. We began by analyzing responses in the first 100 ms time
window after stimulus onset by measuring mean spike rate, variance, and Fano factor. The change in each measure was quantified by computing a modulation index (see Methods) (Fig. 5), and a significant reduction was
observed in all three measures in both AC and MGB during the desynchronized state (p <  0.05, two-tailed t-test
with Bonferroni correction) except mean responses in MGB neurons (p =  0.086) (Fig. 5a–c). Intriguingly, mean
evoked responses decreased in BS cells (p <  0.0005) during the desynchronized state whereas NS cells showed
an opposite trend (p <  0.05) (Fig. 5d). BS cell population showed significant reduction in variability (p <  0.0001)
(Fig. 5e) and Fano factor (p <  0.05) (Fig. 5f). Thus, with heterogeneous effects on cortical cells, the desynchronized state improved spike count reliability in both AC and MGB.
State-dependent temporal structure of auditory evoked population activity.  To identify the difference in state-dependent auditory evoked responses between AC and MGB, we looked at the time evolution of
evoked population activity in AC (Fig. 6a–c) and MGB (Fig. 6d–f). While neurons in both areas showed diverse
response profiles, auditory cortical neurons typically showed a large onset response followed by brief suppression
and rebound activation regardless of cortical state (Fig. 6a–c). Notably, this temporal profile in AC appeared
slightly quicker during the desynchronized state compared to the profile during the synchronized state (Fig. 6c):
the strongest suppression appeared at around 80 ms after stimulus onset in the desynchronized state (~100 ms in
the synchronized state) followed by the quicker rebound activation. On the other hand, brief suppression after
onset responses was not apparent in MGB. To quantify these observations, mean spike time in an 80–200 ms
time window was compared between states (Fig. 6g–i). Mean spike time in AC was significantly shorter in the
desynchronized state compared to that in the synchronized state (p <  0.0005, two-tailed t-test) (Fig. 6g) whereas
there was no significant difference in MGB (p =  0.60) (Fig. 6i). Within AC cell classes, although effects of cortical
states across cell classes were not statistically significant (F4,237 =  0.43, p >  0.05), BS3 cells showed a tendency of

the reduction in mean spike time (Fig. 6h and Supplementary Table 6). Thus, state-dependent rapid response was
observed in AC, not in MGB.

Cortical desynchronization improves rapid auditory processing.  What is the functional consequence of such state-dependent auditory responses ? Based on the finding in Fig. 6, we predicted that the
desynchronized state improves temporal processing in AC, but not in MGB. To test this prediction, we analyzed
state-dependent responses to temporally structured click trains (Fig. 7). Figure 7a shows population activity
(multiunit activity) in cortical infragranular layers, with more precisely resolved click train responses during the
desynchronized state. To quantify this trend at the single-unit level, we assessed the vector strength and statistical
significance of rate modulation (Rayleigh test, p <  0.01) in click train responses across neurons in AC (n =  143)
and MGB (n =  68). Improvement of click train responses during the desynchronized state was observed in AC
with respect to both a modulation index (Fig. 7b) and a difference in the number of significantly modulated cells
between states (Fig. 7c). While the effect varied depending on cell classes and click train frequencies, consistent
improvement was observed in AC, but not in MGB. More BS3 and NS cells consistently improved temporal
processing across click train frequencies (Fig. 7c) whereas within cortical cell classes, BS4 cells appeared to be
sensitive to a particular click train frequency (i.e., 32 Hz) (p <  0.005, two-tailed t-test with Bonferroni correction)
(Fig. 7b). On the other hand, none of tested stimuli significantly improve MGB cells’ responses (p =  0.82 at 4 Hz;
p =  0.19 at 8 Hz; p =  1 at 16 Hz; p =  1 at 32 Hz; p =  0.33 at 64 Hz, two-tailed t-test with Bonferroni correction)
(Fig. 7b). Thus, the desynchronized state improved temporal processing across AC layers to varying degrees, but
not in MGB.

Discussion

Combining in vivo large-scale extracellular recording in the auditory thalamocortical circuit of
urethane-anesthetized rats with BF electrical stimulations, we made the following observations: (1) Cortical states
are associated with distinct cortical oscillations and spontaneous firing across cortical layers; (2) At onset responses
to a single click, neural firing in both AC and MGB became more reliable during the desynchronized state; (3)
NS cells show increased onset responses whereas BS cells show reduction during the desynchronized state; (4)
Although the reduced response variability was also found subcortically, AC population showed a distinct dynamics
of evoked responses, with quicker rebound activity especially in infragranular layers; (5) This rapid processing in
the desynchronized state was associated with the improvement of temporal tuning across AC layers, but not in
MGB. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to characterize state dependence of population activity
in both AC and MGB simultaneously, with an emphasis on firing across cortical layers and the temporal structure
of evoked population responses. These results are also consistent with the hypothesis that AC plays an important
role in integration of external signals with internally generated activity.
Laminar-specific oscillations (Fig. 3) have been observed in several models: in vitro neurophysiological experiments in AC identified strong gamma oscillations in superficial layers, with distinct mechanisms between L2/3

and L441,42, and auditory evoked gamma oscillations have been also seen in vivo43. However, the present results
are novel with respect to state dependence of laminar-specific gamma oscillations in vivo. The reduction in power
across frequencies and layers supports the notion that a “desynchronized” state is indeed asynchronous. One notable exception is the increased gamma power in superficial layers (Fig. 3c). Intriguingly, the macaque visual cortex
also shows stronger gamma oscillations in superficial layers44,45 and they are modulated by attention46, suggesting
a general property across modalities and species. The mechanisms of laminar-specific gamma oscillations are
less clear41. It would be interesting to investigate how thalamic neurons drive superficial parvalbumin-positive
(PV +  ) neurons to modulate superficial gamma oscillations. PV +  neurons in BF may also play a role in cortical
gamma oscillations47.
The exact mechanisms underlying the observations reported here are uncertain because of the nature of electrical stimulation. The BF consists of diverse cell classes, including cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic
neurons48, and so direct effects of electrical BF stimulation on recorded cell populations are likely to be complex.
Moreover, other subcortical structures were also likely to be activated antidromically. Despite this, laminar-specific
effects of BF stimulations on spontaneous firing in AC are generally consistent with a previous study25, where firing
rate in superficial pyramidal cells decreases during different types of desynchronization, including electrical stimulation of another cholinergic nucleus (i.e., pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus) and the desynchronized state in
an unanesthetized condition. Thus, effects of electrical BF stimulation on cortical population activity in AC may be
generalizable. Particularly together with a recent finding in head-restrained behaving mice24, the desynchronized
states are generally associated with sparser superficial activity and diverse effects in infragranular layers. This picture
is also consistent with state-dependent firing in the somatosensory barrel cortex of unanesthetized rodents7,23 and
the primary visual cortex of anesthetized rats8.
However, we also noticed several discrepancies. Although we previously observed the reduction in NS cell
firing25, electrical BF stimulation in the present study did not change spontaneous firing rate of NS cells significantly, implying different mechanisms of cortical desynchronization. For example, assuming that NS cells are
PV +  neurons, the present BF electrical stimulation may not induce a cortical desynchronization via cholinergic
activation of somatostatin-positive neurons49. In addition, the desynchronized state seems to be different from
that in the mouse visual cortex during locomotion13,26. Although these discrepancies still remain to be explained,
cortical states are further defined by subtle differences in population activity2,50. Optogenetic approaches will
disentangle this complexity of cortical desynchronization mechanisms in future.
While a previous study reported enhanced thalamocortical synaptic transmission in AC of anesthetized rats
using nucleus basalis stimulation39, the present study is novel by assessing auditory-evoked responses in both AC
and MGB and by showing cell type specificity. The reduction in onset evoked responses in AC (Fig. 5) is consistent
with observations in behaving rats11 and mice51,52 and the desynchronized somatosensory cortex6 although opposite
effects were observed in the visual cortex13 and lateral geniculate nucleus52. Improved spike count reliability in AC
and MGB is also consistent with previous studies in the visual system8, somatosensory cortex53 and many other
cortical areas54. The reduced response variability in desynchronized cortex may be explained at least partially by
a thalamic contribution55. Intriguingly, we also observed the increased onset response of NS cells, consistent with
the idea that sparse and reliable cortical activity is realized by the dominant inhibition56,57. It will be important to
examine how thalamic cells interact with cortical cells in a cell type-specific manner.
What is special about AC compared to MGB in terms of state-dependent processing ? The quicker rebound
activity in the desynchronized state emerged cortically. Intriguingly, attentional modulation of firing rate is typically
observed in the late component rather than onset responses18, and depends on the prefrontal cortical activity58.
The stronger tendency of the rebound activity in infragranular layers, especially BS3 cells, (Fig. 6h) supports a
recently proposed model in the somatosensory cortex59. In addition to long range cortical feedback, the increased
evoked responses of NS cells during the desynchronized state (Fig. 5c) may also contribute to this quick rebound
firing56. Thus, interactions between local and distal components in cortical circuits are likely key for a mechanistic
understanding of state-dependent modulation at the late phase.
Although the functional role of this quicker rebound activity in auditory processing is uncertain, one functional
implication is the improvement of temporal tuning (Fig. 7). While laminar-dependent spectral27,28 and temporal
tuning29 were previously investigated in AC, the current study offers a novel insight into the functional role of
global brain states in auditory cortical processing. In this regard it will be important to investigate how cortical
states affect rapid auditory processing in behaving animals and how abnormality in temporal tuning is associated
with dyslexia35 and age-related slowness of auditory processing36 at the level of neural circuits. Because BF has
long been implicated in attention, arousal, learning and memory37,38,60, BF stimulation may be beneficial to restore
rapid auditory processing.

Methods

Animals.  Five adult Sprague-Dawley rats (male, 267–357 g) were used. Experiments were performed in
accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 Home Office regulations and approved by
the Home Office (PPL 60/4217).

Surgical procedures.  Animals were anesthetized with 1.5 g/kg urethane. Lidocaine (2%, 0.1–0.3 mg) was
also administered subcutaneously at the site of incision. After attaching a head-post in the frontal region with
bone screws, one of which was used as an electrode for cortical electroencephalograms (EEGs), the animal was
placed in a custom head restraint that left the ears free and clear. Two additional bone screws were implanted
in the cerebellum as ground. Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C with a feedback temperature controller (40–90–8C, FHC). All electrophysiological experiments described below were performed in a single-walled
soundproof box (MAC-3, IAC Acoustics) with the interior covered by 3 inches of acoustic absorption foam.

cortex (5–6 mm posterior from the bregma, around the temporal junction between the parietal and squamosal
bones)61 was removed and a small duratomy for each site was carefully performed. Two 32 channel silicon probes
(A1 ×  32–10 mm–50–177–A32, NeuroNexus Technologies) were inserted slowly (2 μ m/sec or slower) with a
motorized manipulator (DMA-1511, Narishige) or a manual micromanipulator (SM-25A, Narishige), with one
probe to the ventral part of MGB (MGv, 6.0 mm from the dorsal surface of the cortex) and the other to the auditory cortex (AC) (1700 – 1770 μ m from the surface). While the primary auditory cortex was targeted, because
tonotopic maps were not systematically mapped, in the present study we deliberately referred the recorded cortical area as AC. During recording, the brain was covered with 1% agar/0.1 M phosphate buffered saline to reduce
pulsation and to keep the cortical surface moisture. Broadband signals (0.07 Hz – 8 kHz) from the silicon probes
were amplified (1000 times) (Plexon, HST/32V-G20 and PBX3), digitized at 20 kHz and stored for offline analysis
(PXI, National Instruments).
A typical recording schedule was as follows: after insertion of the probes and an additional waiting period (up
to 30 min), recording was started with a silent period (at least 5 min), followed by sound presentations with and
without BF stimulations (see below) and ended with another silent period (at least 5 min). During the latter silent
period, BF stimulation (1 sec) was applied manually to induce the desynchronized state. By confirming recovery
of cortical states to the synchronized state, then another stimulation was applied. This period was used to assess
state-dependent spontaneous activity (Figs 3 and 4).

Acoustic stimulation with BF stimulation.  Acoustic stimuli were generated digitally (sampling rate

97.7 kHz, TDT3, Tucker-Davis Technologies) and delivered in free-field through a calibrated electrostatic loudspeaker (ES1) located ~10 cm in front of the animal. Calibration was conducted using a pressure microphone
(PS9200KIT-1/4, ACO Pacific Inc) close to the animal’s right ear. Acoustic stimuli consisted of brief clicks (5 ms
long broadband noise with 1 ms cosine ramps, 10 dB steps, 0–80 dB SPL) and 1 sec long repetitive click trains
(5 ms broad band noise with 1 ms cosine ramps, 4–64 Hz at 70 dB SPL). To assess state-dependent auditory processing, we adopted a block design8 (Fig. 1c): in “no stimulation” blocks, only auditory stimuli were presented
whereas in “stimulation” blocks, 1 sec BF stimulation was applied at the beginning of every trial, followed by
sound presentations. After the stimulation block, no BF and auditory stimuli were applied for 30 sec to confirm
recovery of cortical states to the synchronized state. Although other acoustic stimuli (short tone pips) were also
presented, these were not analyzed as they were not combined with BF stimulation. The present analysis focused
on evoked responses to clicks at 70 dB SPL for direct comparisons to the click train stimulation at 70 dB SPL.

Histology.  After electrophysiological experiments, rats were perfused transcardially with physiological saline

followed by 4% paraformaldehyde/0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After an overnight postfixation in the same
fixative, brains were cut into 100 μ m coronal sections with a sliding microtome (SM2010R, Leica), and the sections were collected and placed in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS). For verification of silicon probe and
stimulation electrode tracks, the free-floating sections were counterstained with NeuroTrace (1/500, N-21480,
Life Technologies) in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. The sections were mounted on
gelatin-coated slides and cover-slipped with antifade solutions.

Signal processing.  All spike detection and sorting took place off-line using freely available software (EToS

version 3, http://etos.sourceforge.net; Klusters, http://klusters.sourceforge.net)62,63. To avoid clustering in high
dimensional space, only subsets of channels were processed depending on recording quality. For thalamic recordings, only channels which clearly showed auditory evoked responses were processed. After automatic and manual
clustering, unit isolation quality was assessed by measuring “isolation distance”64; only cells with value ≥20 were
further analyzed. Spike train analysis and other signal processing were performed with MATLAB (Mathworks).
To analyze local field potentials (LFPs), low pass filtered (<200 Hz) signals were resampled at 1 kHz. The power
spectral density was computed with Chronux (http://chronux.org).

Depth evaluation.  We aligned the depth of recorded positions across experiments as follows (Fig. 2).
Current source density (CSD) analysis was employed to identify thalamic recipient layers. CSD profiles were
generated from depth profiles of average LFPs using previously described methods27,65. First, we duplicated LFPs
corresponding to the uppermost and lowermost channels. Second, LFPs were smoothed across spatially adjacent
channels to reduce high spatial-frequency noise components:
ϕ (r) =

1
(ϕ (r + h) + 2ϕ (r) + ϕ (r − h))
4

(1)

where ϕ(r) is the LFP at depth r, and h is the sampling interval (50 μ m in this case). Next, we calculated the second
derivative:

www.nature.com/scientificreports/

D=

1
(ϕ (r + h) − 2ϕ (r) + ϕ (r − h))
h2

(2)

Then the channel that showed the largest sink signal was recognized as a thalamic recipient layer, presumably
L3/4, and relative depths were determined accordingly (Fig. 2a).
We further estimated the depth of spike-sorted units25,27. Somatic location was estimated as the recording site
with maximum trough-to-peak amplitude based on mean spike waveforms (Fig. 2b).

Single-unit classification.  Cortical spike-sorted units were classified based on trough-to-peak time of

average spike waveforms (Fig. 2c). 0.55 ms was chosen to discriminate between broad spiking (BS) and narrow
spiking (NS) cells. The latter cell class may correspond to parvalbumin-positive fast spiking neurons66. BS cells
were further classified into four groups based on the estimated somatic location (see above): 0 ~ 200 μ m (BS1),
− 300 ~ 0 μ m (BS2), − 700 ~ − 300 μ m (BS3), and − 1100 ~ − 700 μ m (BS4) (Fig. 2c). These subgroups may correspond to different cortical layers (L2/3, L3/4, L5 and L6)40.

UP state detection.  UP states were detected in Fig. 4e and detailed procedures were described elsewhere27.

Briefly UP states were detected from the smoothed cortical multi-unit activity (MUA) (summed population
activity across channels in AC, smoothed with a 10 ms Gaussian kernel), during periods without stimulus presentation. UP state onsets were determined if the following two conditions were fulfilled: 1) the smoothed MUA
crossed above a threshold defined as the geometric mean of MUA over all spontaneous activity. 2) Mean MUA
rate was below 20% of the threshold value for at least 100 ms before onset. We further analyzed only UP states for
which mean MUA remained above the threshold over a 200 ms window after onset. Spontaneous firing during UP
states was also estimated in this 200 ms window.

Spike train statistics.  For comparison of firing properties (e.g., mean spike count μ, variance σ 2, Fano
factor σ 2/ μ, and vector strength) between the desynchronized and synchronized states, we computed the modulation index as follows: (DESYNC – SYNC)/(DESYNC +  SYNC), where DESYNC and SYNC are firing properties
in the desynchronized and synchronized states, respectively. For comparisons of spontaneous activity, 3 sec time
windows before and after BF stimulation were used.
To quantify click train responses, circular statistics were applied67. Spikes until 50 ms from the first click onset
were not included for this analysis to avoid spuriously high vector strength due to initial onset responses. To
quantify to what extent spike timing aligned to individual clicks of the click train stimulus, a vector strength (the
length of the mean resultant vector) was computed using the following formulae68:

(3)

where n is the total number of spikes, ti is the time of spike occurrence from a click onset, and T is the inter-click
interval. Statistical significance of phase-locked responses to clicks was assessed by the Rayleigh test and a p-value
of less than 0.01 was considered significant.

Correlation analysis.  To compute spike count correlation of spontaneous activity before and after BF stimulation (Fig. 4), spike trains from two simultaneously recorded single units were extracted 3 sec before and after
1-sec BF stimulations and two vectors were constructed with 1 ms bin and 5 ms Gaussian kernel. Then the Pearson
correlation coefficient was computed.
Statistical analysis.  Data were presented as mean ±  SEM. For multiple comparisons, two-way ANOVA was

performed, followed by post-hoc Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) test. In Fig. 4, Kruskal-Wallis test
and signed rank test were applied. In Figs 5 and 7b, two-tailed t-tests with Bonferroni correction were performed
to compare to zero. All statistical analyses were conducted using MATLAB.

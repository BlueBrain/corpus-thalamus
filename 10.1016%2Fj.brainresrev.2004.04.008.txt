Abstract
On the basis of theoretical, anatomical, psychological and physiological considerations, Francis Crick (1984) proposed that, during
selective attention, the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) controls the internal attentional searchlight that simultaneously highlights all the
neural circuits called on by the object of attention. In other words, he submitted that during either perception, or the preparation and
execution of any cognitive and/or motor task, the TRN sets all the corresponding thalamocortical (TC) circuits in motion. Over the last
two decades, behavioural, electrophysiological, anatomical and neurochemical findings have been accumulating, supporting the complex
nature of the TRN and raising questions about the validity of this speculative hypothesis. Indeed, our knowledge of the actual functioning
of the TRN is still sprinkled with unresolved questions. Therefore, the time has come to join forces and discuss some recent cellular and
network findings concerning this diencephalic GABAergic structure, which plays important roles during various states of consciousness.
On the whole, the present critical survey emphasizes the TRN’s complexity, and provides arguments combining anatomy, physiology and
cognitive psychology.

More than a century ago, Ko¨lliker [127] identified a
nucleus at the thalamus –white matter interface with sets of
crossing bundles of axons. He called this nucleus the
Gitterkern (from the German word ‘‘Gitter’’, meaning
lattice). Subsequently, the term ‘‘nucleus reticularis’’ was
introduced by Munzer and Wiener [178], but it was
supplanted by ‘‘noyau raye´’’ or ‘‘noyau grillage´’’ which
was used by Ramon y Cajal [212] to describe the nucleus’
anatomical characteristics in rabbits and mice. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) originates embryologically from
the ventral thalamus [219] and then migrates dorsally to
envelop mainly the anterior and lateral parts of the
thalamus, and partly its dorsal and ventral parts [118].
This shell-shaped nucleus is found in all mammals
[9,101,106]. It is adjacent ventromedially to the zona
incerta and caudally to the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus
[119].
The TRN occupies a key position for thalamocortical
(TC) and corticothalamic (CT) operations since it is
located at the thalamus-white matter interface - between
the internal capsule and the external medullary laminawhere TC and CT axons intersect [92] and where these

give off collaterals to innervate TRN cells (Fig. 1). The
reticular nucleus (or TRN) is a reservoir of GABAergic
cells [60,107]. In the following, the term ‘‘thalamus’’
implicitly means ‘‘dorsal thalamus’’, otherwise it will be
clarified.

1. Virtually all functional modalities
The TRN is concerned with almost if not all functional
modalities. Moreover, electrophysiological studies have
demonstrated the existence of at least seven sectors in the
TRN, five sensory (auditory, gustatory, somatosensory,
visceral and visual), one motor and one limbic. Shosaku
et al. [234,235] performed comprehensive physiological
studies in the rat showing the topographic organization of
the somatosensory, auditory (also see Ref. [267]) and visual
sectors (Fig. 2). The large size of the visual sector (dorsocaudal part of the TRN) has been confirmed using an
anterograde and retrograde tracer [38]. The latter study
has further revealed that the visual sector is divided into
subsectors, each receiving inputs from distinct cortical
visual areas. Using anatomical means, Hayama et al. [102]
and Stehberg et al. [245] revealed a taste-related region
located in the ventromedial-most portion of the TRN and a
visceral sector in the intermediate part of the TRN at the
mid-dorsoventral level, respectively. Whether or not there is
an olfactory sector is an unresolved question but olfactory
inputs have been identified in the rat in the medial dorsal
nucleus of the thalamus [208], a nucleus that is reciprocally
connected with the rostral part of the TRN [42,89,199]. The
motor and limbic sectors, which have not yet been well
defined, are located in the rostral part of the rat’s TRN
[84,85,199].
Each sector has its own anatomical organization, which
is determined by its input and output relationships with the
corresponding, first-order and higher-order, thalamic nuclei
and related cortical areas (see reviews by Crabtree [51] and
by Guillery et al. [94]). Both ‘‘first-order nuclei’’ and
‘‘higher-order nuclei’’ were first defined by Guillery [91]
on the basis of their principal ‘‘driver’’ inputs (also see Ref.
[186]). The main driver inputs of first-order thalamic nuclei
are prethalamic inputs (e.g., somatosensory, auditory and
visual inputs), whereas those of higher-order nuclei emerge
from cortical layer V cells. The thalamic-projecting axon
collateral of the latter cortical neurons cross the TRN
without innervating it and their terminal axonal arbors have
morphological features to drive restricted thalamic regions,
like prethalamic afferents [22,23,186]. Regarding this nomenclature, one should not exclude that some first-order and

auditory (A-TRN) sectors of the TRN (lateral view). Rows of whiskers are
indicated by A – E. Adapted from Ref. [235].

higher-order nuclei probably also contain higher-order and
first-order circuits. For instance, this is the case for intralaminar nuclei, which receive their principal driver inputs
from both the periphery and the neocortex [4,21,153,192].
Such nuclei may be considered as ‘‘mixed’’ nuclei [231].
Reticular sectors can be subdivided into anatomical
recipient regions of distinct but functionally related thalamic nuclei and cortical areas (see review by Guillery et
al. [94]). One typical example is the rat’s somatosensory
sector, which contains three tiers (internal, intermediate
and external). They are interconnected with the first-order
thalamic nuclei (ventral, posterolateral and posteromedial,
nuclei) in an ordered fashion whereas only the internal tier
is interconnected with the posterior thalamic nuclear group,
a higher-order nucleus (Fig. 3C). Reticular tiers projecting
to first-order nuclei display a well-defined topography
whereas those projecting to higher-order nuclei seem not
to [49]. In cats and rabbits, the somatosensory sector
seems to have only one tier [47 –49].

2. Receptive field properties
Reticular cells generally have larger receptive fields than
TC neurons [207,224,240,260,277,279]. Although the experimental conditions (e.g., type and depth of anaesthesia)
modulate the characteristics of the receptive field(s) of any
given neuron in some way, the data currently to hand
demonstrate that a small percentage of TRN cells can
respond to two sensory modalities, probably those that are
located within a region that is common to two adjacent
sectors. Moreover, the existence of poly-sensory interactions
suggests that adjacent sectors are not sharply bounded.
Overlaps between sectors were observed using electrophysiological studies [207,245,251]. For instance, Sugitani [251]
found about 1% of the units in the rat’s TRN responding to
either somatosensory and visual inputs, or somatosensory
and auditory inputs. The physiological significance of bimodal units remains, however, to be determined.
A somatotopic representation of the body surface is
present in the TRN of rats [235,236], cats and monkeys

[207]. In cats and monkeys that are awake, distinct TRN loci
representing different parts of the body can have overlapping receptive fields [207]. Under urethane-anaesthesia,
three different response patterns of vibrissae TRN units
(ON-tonic, ON-phasic and ON-OFF-phasic) have been
recorded, some of which also respond to visual or to
auditory inputs [251]. In the visual sector of the anaesthetized cat TRN cells are binocular and exhibit both ON and
OFF visual responses [224,240,260,277]. In urethane-anaesthetized or lightly narcotized rats, TRN cells transiently fire
at both the onset and the offset of whisker deflection
[99,232]; in addition, they display robust tonic firing during
sustained whisker deflection. To compare, TC neurons of
the corresponding somatosensory thalamic nucleus display a
weaker tonic pattern and usually exhibit tonic suppression.
Thalamocortical and TRN neurons are selective for deflection angle and display best responses to a particular direction [99]. These observations clearly show that TRN cells
play a key role in the processing of submodalities, particularly in a way limiting the duration of TC responses.

3. Diverse somatodendritic architectures
From a morphological viewpoint, it is not yet clear
whether the TRN contains a homogeneous or heterogeneous cellular population. When investigating the architecture of rabbit and mouse TRN cells with the silver
chromate method, Ramon y Cajal [212] highlighted the
long hairy and sparsely divided dendritic processes emerging from a fusiform or triangular cell body. Using Golgi
impregnation of thalamic pieces of adult cats, Scheibel and
Scheibel [226] identified tightly packed dendritic bundles
in the dorsolateral portion of the TRN but not in its
anterior pole, showing the heterogenic nature of this
nucleus. Such bundles were also observed in the dorsolateral TRN following juxtacellular multi-unit staining (Fig.
4). Today, we have no idea how far such singular structures extend, nor do we know anything about their
functional significance. Dendritic bundles seem to be
formed by parallel dendritic components that belong to
neighbouring cells, which are remote within a range of a
few tens to a few hundreds of micrometers.
Using Nissl stain, Golgi impregnation, retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase following thalamic injections,
GABA immunocytochemistry and in vitro intracellular stainings with HRP-filled micropipettes, Spreafico et al. [243,244]
found three morphological types of TRN cells in the adult
rat: (1) a small fusiform ‘‘f’’ type characterized by an
elongated perikaryon, and a dendritic arborization extending in the rostrocaudal and dorsoventral planes. This type
was observed almost exclusively in the medial third of the
dorsoventral extent of the nucleus; (2) large fusiform ‘‘F’’
neurons with dendrites arborizing mainly in the horizontal
plane were seen throughout the whole extent of the
nucleus; (3) cells with round perikarya and with multipolar

dendrites were found predominantly in the rostral pole of
the nucleus.
On the other hand, following intracellular injection of
TRN cells in fixed thalamic slices of three species (rat,
rabbit and cat), Lubke [149] found no obvious basis for
classification of neurons in the mammalian TRN according
to dendritic morphology. Furthermore, after observing the
3D reconstruction of cells retrogradely labelled in the whole

TRN of adult rats, Ohara and Havton [183] concluded that
all TRN cells have a similar dendritic morphology and
orientation, that is, dendritic arbours with a planar discoidlike architecture and extending either dorso-ventrally or
rostro-caudally.
Having individually labelled more than 100 TRN cells
using the juxtacellular technique and reconstructed more
than a few tens of them in 3D in a previous study [199], it is

D. Pinault / Brain Research Reviews 46 (2004) 1–31

important to note that, whatever the cellular type, most of its
dendrites usually span more than one tier (Fig. 5) (also see
Ref. [244]), implying that any TRN cell may combine
information from several different kinds of thalamic and
cortical inputs (e.g., first-order and higher-order). Thus,
from an architectural viewpoint the TRN may be considered
as a heterogeneous structure. As we shall see below,
immunocytochemical and electrophysiological data support
this notion.

4. Cellular neurochemical diversities

region of the rat’s TRN. Note the parallel organization of dendrites, which
can form dendritic bundles (white arrowheads) in these horizontal sections
(A and B).

tempting to show that the TRN contains at least three types
in terms of their dendritic architecture: (1) cells with
dendritic ramifications which mainly extend dorso-ventrally
(Fig. 5B), (2) cells with dendritic ramifications which
mainly extend rostro-caudally and (3) cells with dendritic
ramifications extending in nearly all directions (Fig. 5D).
While the first two types are observed in almost all TRN
regions (also see Ref. [183]), the third type is observed
especially in the rostral and ventral regions where the TRN
space is the largest [199,243]. These 3D data further show
that even when a ‘‘pure’’ architectural type does exist (e.g.,
only dorso-ventral or rostro-caudal extension of the dendrites), intermediary types also do exist (Fig. 5C).
In conclusion, taken together these morphological findings are somewhat controversial. They show that the dendritic shapes that are seen may depend on the section plane
of the curve-shaped TRN (see Fig. 5A). Therefore, it is
important to perform 3D reconstruction of any labelled
neuron to gain a better idea of its real architecture. Any
architectural type may belong to a continuum adapting itself
to the available space, which is larger in the rostral pole than
in the caudal pole; furthermore, each sector has its own
anatomical input – output relationships, and the orientation
of the dendritic arbours appear to match the organization of
the related TC and CT inputs. These are known to form
ordered slab-like arrangement in sensory sectors [47,48]
(see also reviews by Crabtree [51] and by Guillery and
Harting [92]) but not in the limbic sector [147]. It is also

The heterogeneity of the TRN has also been demonstrated using immunocytochemical stainings, in particular of
Ca2 +-binding proteins (calbindin, parvalbumin and calretinin), which are present in different subsets of TRN neurons
in various species [37,72,77,140,161,215,274]. Calciumbinding proteins are important molecules acting like buffers
to modulate dynamics of cytosolic Ca2 + transients [13].
Such intracellular proteins can have significant functional
consequences on the membrane potential, firing pattern and
synaptic transmission [13,33,124]. In rodents, the postnatal
maturation of calbindin and parvalbumin is relatively slow
[77], like that of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone [162].
The complexity of the TRN is also accounted for by the
pharmacological properties of its neurons. This consideration has not been developed herein but would be an
appropriate subject for another review. Six intriguing points
can, however, be mentioned. (1) The glutamate is usually
viewed as the most important classical excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS. Since it is the prime neurotransmitter
liberated by both TC and CT inputs in the TRN, its overall
net effect is of course excitatory. It is worth mentioning that
the glutamate can have a small inhibitory effect in some
TRN cells mediated through the activation of group II
metabotropic glutamate receptors, as demonstrated using
an in vitro slice preparation [43]. (2) Dopamine receptors,
which are the main targets of therapeutic drugs used to treat
schizophrenia, are present in the TRN [108,174], but the
source of eventual dopaminergic inputs in the TRN has not
yet been identified [108] and the physiological action of
these receptors remains elusive [74]. (3) The mRNA of the
thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptors are prominently
expressed in the TRN [105], and the corresponding hormone is immunocytochemically present in TRN cells
[134,162]. These molecular studies suggest that the thyrotropin-releasing hormone is a major GABA partner during
TC operations, perhaps acting directly from one TRN cell to
another. (4) Somatostatin is a well-known peptide that is
present in GABAergic cells, including those in the TRN of
various species, from rodents to human beings [19,30,88]. It
operates in different sites with brake effects on oscillations,
suggesting that it may play a major role in physiological and
pathological cellular and network activities [253]. (5) Cholecystokinin, which is present in cortical and thalamic

observed following 3D reconstruction of juxtacellularly marked individual TRN cells [199]. (A1 and A2) Approximate location of three typical TRN cells,
which have mainly either a dorso-ventral (B), rostro-caudal (C) or dorso-ventral + rostro-caudal (D) extension of their dendritic arborization. The drawings are
made from a series of frontal and horizontal rat’s sections (left [A1] and right [A2] TRN). The negative numbers correspond to the rostrocaudal (A1) or
dorsoventral (A2) distances (in mm) between the bregma and the frontal or horizontal TRN sections, which are set equally apart of about 0.2 mm, referring to
the Paxinos and Watson’s atlas [191]. (B, C or D) Each photomicrograph shows parts of the marked cell’s dendritic field on a single 80 – 100-Am-thick section
(B and D = frontal sections, C = horizontal section). The 3D reconstruction of each cellular type is seen from a posterior view. Note that about two-thirds and
one-third of the dendrites of cell C extend in the horizontal and vertical planes, respectively. A, anterior; D, dorsal; IC, internal capsule; L, lateral; M, medial; P,

neurons [111,227], exerts a depolarizing action in rats’ TRN
cells by suppressing a K+ conductance [44]. The majority of
cholecystokinin immunostaining is confined to axon terminals, which apparently belongs to TC neurons (Acsady,
unpublished observation). (6) Other peptides such as vasoactive intestinal [31], prolactin-releasing [218] peptides and

neuropeptide Y [164,172] are also present in the TRN. The
modulatory and/or transmitter actions of neuropeptides are
far from being understood. It has recently been shown that
endogenous neuropeptide Y can be released from TRN cells
following burst activity and directly generates IPSPs in
TRN cells but not in relay neurons [254]. Since neuro-

D. Pinault / Brain Research Reviews 46 (2004) 1–31

peptides can cause long-lasting modulations of neuronal
activities, their precise functional role should be assessed
further during different functional states of the TC system.

5. Corticothalamic and thalamocortical inputs
The TRN receives monosynaptic glutamatergic inputs
mainly from both the cerebral cortex [26,69,75] and the
thalamus [76,125]. The only source of CT inputs is layer
VI [22,73]. The CT and TC inputs are recognized as
being mainly excitatory [2,66,83,157,179]. They are topographically organized, with some exceptions, particularly where inputs from higher-order structures are
concerned (reviewed by Crabtree [51] and by Guillery
et al. [94]). Also, TRN sectors receive convergent inputs
from different cortical areas. Roughly, CT and TC axonal
projections are topographically organized, forming multiple maps, which have not yet well been defined [231].
First-order and higher-order thalamic inputs can overlap
each other, meaning that TRN cells may integrate information from both sources. However, in the visual sector,
first-order and higher-order visual cortical areas are represented in distinct subsectors in rabbits [53] and rats
[38]. Developmental studies have shown that the mapping
of the CT and TC axons is determined early on (E14 –
E19 in rats) by a group of peri-TRN cells located laterally
to the TRN [163]. Such a mapping has not yet been
demonstrated in the visual sector. At the cellular level
every single TC axon innervates, within the TRN, a locus
whose size tends to fit in approximately with the field
occupied by a single TRN dendrite (Fig. 6). A single TC
neuron is therefore expected to innervate dendritic subfields of more than one TRN cell (also see Ref. [97]).
This might explain why TRN neurons usually have large
receptive fields, giving credence to the notion that a given
TRN cell is an integrator.
Furthermore, individual layer VI CT axon collaterals are
organized in the TRN in a fashion [22] that appears to be
similar to that of single TC axon collaterals. However, CT
axons are much more numerous by far than TC axons by a
magnitude of about 10 [90,119], meaning that, in the TRN,
the number of CT synapses is much greater than that of TC
synapses. Layer VI CT neurons are more effective in
generating larger excitatory synaptic conductances in TRN
than in TC neurons [83]. The latter findings support the
notion that CT neurons play an important role during TC
operations.
The synaptology of the TRN of different species (rats,
cats and monkeys) has been extensively studied since the
beginning of the eighties [110,137,184]. In the TRN neuropil, the majority of terminals are excitatory and form
asymmetric synapses on all portions of TRN dendrites. In
general, these electron microscope studies could distinguish
between large (L) and small (S) terminals forming asymmetrical synapses throughout the TRN dendritic trees. A

combination of immunocytochemistry and degeneration and
axonal tracing methods led to the finding that the L and S
types of axon terminals in the TRN neuropil are from TC
and CT neurons, respectively [137,165,182,184]. However,
it cannot be ruled out that some of these terminals might
also originate from other sources (e.g., brainstem nuclei). It
should be emphasized that possible differences in the
ultrastructural characteristics of first-order and higher-order
thalamic inputs were not distinguished in any of these
studies.
Correlating light and electron microscope observations,
Pinault et al. [204] found that the hillock and initial segment
of some TRN axons were densely covered with GABAnegative terminals forming asymmetric synapses, a finding
that is in keeping with previous electron microscope observations [182]. The corresponding presynaptic terminals
were of the L type and this thought to serve as a major
constraint on the output of TRN cells. Because this large
type was presumed to belong to TC neurons, we examined
juxtacellularly labelled TC boutons. Though this matter is
still being investigated, the exact source of excitatory
synaptic inputs on the axon hillock of TRN neurons has
yet to be established.

6. Other afferents
In addition to the cortical and thalamic glutamatergic
afferents, the TRN also receives GABAergic [11,58,79,
190], cholinergic and monoaminergic inputs [10,56,96,
108,136,275], most of these being involved in the control
of vigilance. Some functional aspects of these modulatory
inputs are available elsewhere [156].

7. Parallel and divergent axonal projections
Ramon y Cajal [212] observed in Golgi impregnated
pieces of brain tissue that TRN axons took a ventro-caudal
direction, which to all appearances was not the way toward
the cerebral cortex. Using similar histological techniques,
Scheibel and Scheibel [225] confirmed that TRN axons
project to thalamic nuclei (see also Ref. [160]). The principal axon of TRN cells emerges from the soma or a dendrite
and usually penetrates the thalamus perpendicularly to the
thalamus – TRN interface (see Fig. 3A – C).
Reticular axonal projections to the dorsal thalamus have
long been regarded as being almost exclusively ipsilateral.
However, retrograde and anterograde labelling experiments
have suggested the presence of TRN commissural axonal
projections to contralateral thalamic nuclei in various mammalian species [17,35,104,188,213,217]. On the other hand,
multiunit [103] and single-unit [199] anterograde labelling
procedures revealed instead that the contralateral component of some TRN axonal projections seem not to be
noticeable if indeed they are present at all. Whether or

not a significant population of TRN neurons innervates both
thalami is a fundamental question that is worth probing
further.
It should perhaps be said that, for years, it was believed
that the TRN does not project into the anterior thalamus,
at least in the cat [189,247,266]. At variance with this
longstanding concept, several anatomical studies have
demonstrated that the TRN does project topographically
to the anterior thalamic nuclei in rats, monkeys
[84,85,129] and seemingly in cats [266]. In view of these
data, it might be questioned whether or not the innervation
of anterior nuclei by the TRN is important in felines.
Further anatomical studies are needed to clarify this issue.
In parallel with the development of modern anatomical
procedures, it is well established that, in various species,

TRN axons project into nearly all the anterior, dorsal,
intralaminar, posterior and ventral thalamic nuclei according
to a loose parallel pattern with a certain degree of divergence [85,95,118,129,199,212,225,247,255,266]. More accurately, adjacent TRN cells with non-overlapping
somatodendritic arbours project to two adjacent distinct
districts in the corresponding thalamic nucleus (Fig. 7A1);
TRN cells with overlapping somatodendritic arbours have
overlapping axon terminal fields (Fig. 7A2).
Two intriguing features were noticed during the course
of a single-cell anatomical study [199,204]: (1) about 2%
of stained cells had two axons emanating from two
distinct, somatic and dendritic, locations that projected
to the same thalamic target; (2) the main axon of about
3% of neurons originated from a distal dendrite and bore

varicosities just like it as if they were a ‘‘dendrite’’
arborizing into the thalamus. The functional significance
of TRN cells with a dendrite-like axon arborizing into the
thalamus is unknown. If we assume that these structural
features are not just developmental errors, they are
intriguing because they raise questions about the respective functional properties of the somatodendritic and of
the axonal arbours of such TRN cells.

The pattern of TRN axonal projections that emerged
following intracellular or juxtacellular staining varied
within a single nucleus, from one nucleus to another,
between species and during development. Scheibel and
Scheibel [225] observed Golgi-impregnated TRN cells of
young animals (kittens, rats and mice) with diffuse axonal
projections through first-order and higher-order thalamic
nuclei. In young rats, the projection patterns of individual

10

D. Pinault / Brain Research Reviews 46 (2004) 1–31

axons deriving from the somatosensory sector were categorized into three types, ranging from compact to diffuse
[45]. Since this in vitro study was performed in young
animals, it might be questioned whether these three types
are still present in the adult or whether they represent an
accumulation of all the stages of brain development. In
adult cats, cells in the visual sector have robust and/or
sparse axonal components in the related thalamus [260];
those of the somatosensory sector display diffuse branches
in the related thalamic nuclei [278,279]. In adult rats,
TRN cells in both the somatosensory and the visual
sectors form clear-cut, dense axon terminal fields in the
corresponding thalamic nuclei [202,203]. The latter studies demonstrate that, at cellular level, TRN axonal projections are highly segregated, albeit primarily in a
parallel manner (also see Ref. [199]). This does not,
however, exclude overlapping between individual focused
axonal projections inside a given thalamic nucleus (Fig.
8), suggesting the existence of well-organized innervations
within a space continuum.
Divergence of axonal projections was first suggested
by Scheibel and Scheibel [225] following observation of
Golgi impregnated neurons. Retrograde labelling experi-

ments in whole animal preparations indicated that a given
TRN locus may give rise to divergent axonal projections
to intralaminar and midline nuclei in both rats [128] and
cats [247]. In the cat the dual projections toward the
posterior nuclear group and the ventrobasal complex are
said to result from 50% to 70% of the TRN cells
scattered throughout the somatosensory sector [49]. By
means of in vitro intracellular labellings in the visual
sector [260], it was demonstrated that TRN cells project
almost exclusively into the A-laminae of the cat visual
thalamus and that some neurons display a second axonal
branch, which presumably runs toward another visualrelated thalamic nucleus, perhaps a higher-order thalamic
nucleus (posterior nuclear group and/or lateral posterior).
Moreover, using the juxtacellular technique in anaesthetized rats, Pinault and Descheˆnes [199] revealed that a
minority of TRN cells ( < 5%) had an axon that split into
two branches innervating a first-order nucleus (e.g., ventral posteromedial nucleus) and a functionally related
higher-order nucleus (e.g., posterior nuclear group; Fig.
3B); in addition, TRN neurons with overlapping dendritic
arbours could project into two separate thalamic nuclei
involved in the same function (Fig. 7B2). From a functional viewpoint, the TRN may be viewed therefore as a
‘‘hub’’ [143], marshalling ongoing TC information not
only into a parallel process but also with a degree of
interactions between pathways involving distinct but functionally related thalamic nuclei (Fig. 7B1,B2,C,D).
Structural and morphometric analysis of juxtacellularly
stained rats’ TRN axon terminal arbours demonstrated
that the clustering of boutons optimally matches the
somatodendritic architecture of the corresponding postsynaptic TC neurons [199]. Within the axonal patches,
boutons tend to form grape-like clusters or strings according to the tufted or linear architecture of the postsynaptic
dendrites, and it is very probable that the purpose of this
is to ensure that the corresponding synaptic and integrative functions are sufficiently enhanced. This rule seems
to apply both to the first-order (e.g., ventrobasal complex)
and to the higher-order (e.g., lateral posterior and/or
posterior nuclear group) thalamic nuclei, which contain
bushy and star-like relay cells, respectively (Fig. 9).
Terminations of TRN axons make Gray type II axodendritic and axosomatic synaptic contacts with TC neurons
[57,98,139,169,185,193]. It is worth mentioning that some
thalamic nuclei include GABAergic interneurons [231],
which do not seem as being the major synaptic target of
TRN axon terminals [139,269]. These local circuit cells
are much greater in number in felines and primates than
in rodents [119,231].
In conclusion, it is tempting to propose that the TRN may
perform at least two types of control over information on its
way to the cerebral cortex: (1) one type seems to involve the
ordered parallel TRN axonal projections toward first-order
and higher-order thalamic nuclei (parallel processing), while
(2) the second appears to be a more complex form of

control, also involving divergent axonal projections toward
at least two separate nuclei (combining processing). The
functional properties of these two potential controls are
unknown.

8. Closed- and open-loop thalamo-reticulo-thalamic
circuits
It is usually argued that the thalamus and the TRN are
reciprocally connected [95,118,230]. The reciprocal thalamus-TRN relationship does not, however, fully apply at
the cellular level when examining both the anterogradely
and the retrogradely labelled neuronal elements following

juxtacellular applications of a compound containing biotin
[200] (also see Fig. 10). Furthermore, an anatomical study
aimed at labelling both afferent and efferent axonal projections from cat TRN loci showed that the distribution of
marked neurons and anterograde labelling did not completely overlap between the pulvinar-lateralis posterior
complex and the related TRN sector [71]. Taken together,
these data demonstrate that between themselves TC and
TRN neurons form open- and closed-loop connections.
Those two circuits represent the anatomical substrates of
mechanisms of lateral and feedback inhibition, respectively
(Fig. 10C1,C2). Neither the relative importance nor the
actual functional significance of these two types of inhibition have yet been determined in any TC system or

species. It is worth saying that, in some thalamic nuclei,
GABAergic interneurons should somehow interfere with
the functional role of TRN cells during TC operations, an
issue that merits investigation.
These anatomical findings are in line with in vitro [81,145]
and in vivo [233,236] physiological data revealing a small
proportion of TC-TRN cellular pairs with closed disynaptic loops (about 7 – 17% and 20%, respectively). In
urethane-anaesthetized rats, Shosaku [233] used paired
recordings and cross-correlation analysis to show that
TRN and TC neurons with receptive fields on the same
vibrissa could interact with each other (excitations and/or
inhibitions). The excitation – inhibition pattern, which pre-

sumably represented reciprocal interactions, was seen in a
few instances (7 out of 34). Furthermore, no significant
functional interaction could be detected between TRN and
TC neurons having receptive fields on different vibrissae.
Shosaku [233] concluded that TRN axonal projections’
convergence and divergence from a significant number of
thalamic neurons with receptive fields on the same
vibrissa play a role in channelling ongoing sensory
information in the TC system. By means of extracellular
and intracellular recordings in slices of the ferret visual
thalamus, it was shown that reciprocal interactions between subsets of hyperpolarized TC and TRN neurons
were responsible for generating rhythmic burst-firing in

D. Pinault / Brain Research Reviews 46 (2004) 1–31

the TC system [268]. Intracellular recordings of TC
neurons in slices of the cat visual thalamus revealed a
post-action potential long-lasting hyperpolarization, which
was bicuculline-sensitive, in only a few geniculate cells
[145]. This postsynaptic event was wisely interpreted as
being the manifestation of either an actual feedback
inhibition, or a lateral inhibition generated by a coincident
action potential in another TC neuron. In none of those
electrophysiological studies was the corresponding anatomical correlate demonstrated. Neither do they tell us
how closed- and open-loop circuits work.
The vibrissal TC sensory system of rodents is highly
segregated, representing an excellent model of modular
organization from periphery to cortex [23,63,131,262,
264,265,276]. In other words, one given whisker is principally represented by a thalamic module (or ‘‘barreloid’’,
a term introduced by Van der Loos [261]) and by a cortical
module (or ‘‘barrel’’, a term introduced by Woolsey and
Van der Loos [276]). The role played by TRN cells in this
modular organization is far from understood. By means of
a double-labelling protocol in adult rats, it has recently
been demonstrated that the axon of a TRN cell responding
to the principal whisker of its receptive field projects
within the limits of the whisker-related module [63]. It is
important to note that the relay cells’ dendritic field
extends into adjacent modules [264]. Furthermore, the
corresponding distal dendrites receive GABAergic inputs
from TRN cells whose principal receptive field is an
adjacent whisker. These closed-loop connections are
thought to be the anatomical substrate of crosstalk inhibitions between adjacent thalamic modules, which might
involve the following two inhibitory mechanisms (Fig. 11):
(1) a recurring inhibition of the proximal dendrites of the
relay cells responding to the principal whisker of its
receptive field; (2) a lateral inhibition of the distal dendrites of the relay cells whose principal receptive field is
an adjacent whisker. These findings, however, raise at least
three questions: (1) Since TRN cells with overlapping
somatodendritic arbours have overlapping axon terminal
fields (Fig. 8), and reticular and relay neurons have
receptive fields defined by one main and a few adjacent
whiskers [8,65,237], it might be that these closed-loop
connections represent one extreme of a continuum between
closed-and open-loop connections. Such a loose parallel
pattern certainly cries out for physiological studies. (2)
Somatosensory-related TRN cells display focused axon
terminal fields of at least two types, one occupying
approximately the space of a module, the other segregated
into patches, each of which is approximately the size of a
module [199,202,203]. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out
that a given TRN cell may be involved in both recurrent
and lateral inhibitions.
In conclusion, the question of how lateral and recurrent
inhibitory mechanisms work is still open to debate. Both
mechanisms may function in isolation or in concert
during normal TC operations. They are presumed to

Fig. 11. Crosstalk inhibitions between adjacent thalamic modules in the
somatosensory system. Two adjacent modules (M1 and M2) correspond to
two adjacent whiskers (w1 and w2). For simplicity, in this drawing, one
module contains the cell body and the proximal part of its somatodendritic
arbour of one relay neuron. Each TRN cell is involved in a recurrent
inhibition mechanism that occurs on the proximal dendrites of each relay
cell responding to the principal whisker of its receptive field. The same
TRN cell is also involved in a lateral inhibition mechanism on the distal
dendrites of the relay cells whose principal receptive field is an adjacent
whisker.

generate their counterpart, that is, disinhibitions adjacent
to inhibitions. These mechanisms, which are schematically
represented in Fig. 12, are likely valid in thalamic nuclei
that do not contain interneurons, which are known as
being a source of inhibitory inputs in TC neurons (e.g.,
see Ref. [46]). In the vibrissal system, closed-loop connections might be involved simultaneously in at least two
subtle levels of integration: (1) a modular integration of
information generated by the inputs activated by the
principal whisker of the receptive field and (2) a more
general integration of information generated by the inputs
activated by adjacent whiskers. The functional relationship

Fig. 12. Likely synaptic relations between single thalamocortical (in black)
and TRN (in red) neurons in the case of lateral inhibition. These drawn
nerve cells, which are respectively excitatory and inhibitory, form an openloop circuit. Some of the terminal axonal boutons of one TC neuron contact
one TRN cell, and some terminal boutons of one TRN cell make synaptic
contacts with one TC neuron. Activation of the open-loop starts with
neuron TC1, for instance following an afferent discharge on a specific
prethalamic input (black arrow). This cell, via its axon collateral, excites
cell TRN2, which then inhibits cell TC2 (lateral inhibition). The neuron
TRN2 presumably inhibits cell TRN1 (via dendrodendritic GABAergic
synapses), which then would disinhibit the neuron TC1 (feedback
disinhibition). Adapted from Ref. [200].

in a reciprocal manner either between first-order and
higher-order, sensory-related or motor-related, nuclei or
between higher-order nuclei. As it is known that one
TRN locus can innervate two thalamic nuclei and that
TRN loci are reciprocally connected with their respective
target regions, it might be surmised that a given disynaptic pathway passing through an TRN locus operates in
both directions. These TC – TRN – TC circuits might allow
modality-related and cross-modality modulation of ongoing information through diverse thalamic nuclei (Fig. 13).
Anatomical studies strongly suggest that some of these
pathways are likely to be present in the adult [49,50,
128,148,199,247]. Such circuits would represent a powerful tool for the TRN to select the appropriate intrathalamic pathways for any sensory, motor and cognitive
task.

between the open- and closed-loop circuits still has to be
determined, however, at both modular and regional levels.
Another important point worthy of special attention is that
the inhibitory mechanisms involved in any integration
process depend on the state of the corresponding networks [100]. It is also tempting to speculate that during
physiological processing both inhibitory mechanisms may
work independently and/or sometimes in concert whereas
during certain neurological and psychiatric disorders they
may systematically function together as a whole, for
instance during high-voltage synchronized oscillations
(e.g., during episodes of sleep or generalized epileptic
seizures).

9. Large-scale thalamo-reticulo-thalamic circuits
It is generally thought that, unlike to cortical areas, TC
neurons do not interact with each other. Crabtree et al.
[52,54] have demonstrated recently in thalamic slices of
young rats that glutamate-induced activation of neurons in
a thalamic nucleus is associated with inhibition of cellular
activities in another distinct but functionally related thalamic nucleus, and conversely. The inhibition is mediated
through activation of GABAA receptors. Because the
thalamic slices were free of reciprocal connections with
the cerebral cortex, these intrathalamic functional interactions are likely to involve a disynaptic pathway passing
through the TRN. Moreover, both thalamic nuclei project
to the same TRN sector, and that sector projects to both
nuclei. These intrathalamic functional connections occur

10. Intrinsic cell – cell communications
Various anatomical and functional studies have attempted
to show that TRN cells communicate synaptically between
each other through dendrodendritic and/or axodendritic
synapses. Mutual inhibitory synaptic interactions between
TRN cells in the visual sector were first recorded in
anaesthetized adult cats [3]. Indeed, electrical stimulation
of the optic tract induced a short-latency excitation in TRN
cells followed by an inhibitory period, during which the
excitatory response that followed electrical stimulation of
the related visual cortex was no longer recorded. Local
application of glutamate in the ferret’s perigeniculate nucleus (visual sector of the TRN) maintained in vitro induced
GABAA-dependent IPSPs in cells located in the neighbourhood of the application [223] (Fig. 14). One cannot exclude
that in some TRN cells such IPSPs occasionally include a
small GABAB-mediated component [259]. In the presence
of GABAA receptor blockade, glutamate-induced excitation
of a perigeniculate locus produces GABAB -dependent
IPSPs in a subset of perigeniculate cells [223]. The blockade
was achieved using the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide, which also blocked an IK(Ca) in TRN
cells directly [59]. Disynaptic or polysynaptic GABAAmediated inhibitions have recently been recorded in mouse
TC slices’ TRN cells following focal electrical stimulation
of layer VI in the related cortex [281]. Taken together, these
findings strongly suggest that excitation of a pool of TRN
cells can trigger widespread inhibitions in the TRN. Sohal
and Huguenard [241] demonstrated in rat thalamic slices

15

that intra-TRN inhibitions limit the number and synchrony
of TRN cellular bursts. Mutual GABAergic inhibitions
between TRN cells are thought to be mediated by intrinsic
axodendritic synapses (see below). In another separate in
vitro study, dual single-cell recordings in thalamic slices of
young rodents (rats and mice) were, however, unable to
reveal the presence of inhibitory chemical synaptic connections between adjacent TRN cells [132]. Therefore, assuming that lateral synaptic interactions do exist, the question is
whether intranuclear inhibitory interactions involve nearby
and/or remote neurons.
Paired-cell recordings (inter-cell distance: up to 35 Am)
in thalamic slices of young rodents (rat and mouse, P14–
P21) have recently demonstrated the presence of functional
electrical cellular couplings in the TRN (Fig. 15), with
strong low-pass filtering characteristics [132]. Such couplings have not been recorded in mice with a null mutation
for the connexion-36 gene. They are thought to play a
significant role in intra-TRN cellular synchronizations especially of low-frequency events such as low-threshold
Ca2 + spikes. Such electrically generated synchronizations
(in the range of 10 Hz) concern small clusters of TRN cells
[146]. Although their morphological substratum is thought
to be gap junctions, such electrical synapses have not yet
been seen during ultrastructural analyses of the TRN in
various species [62,138,182,184,204,279]. Connexin-36 has
recently been observed at focal sites on plasma membranes
of TRN dendrites and somata in postnatal mouse brain
without any association with identifiable gap junctions
[138]. It is worth to say that such close membrane junctional

complexes are difficult to see in the brain, even in the
cerebral cortex [256]. Therefore, the basic mechanism
underlying electrical couplings using gap junctions between

adjacent TRN cells in young rodents still eludes us. Again, it
is possible that these potential electrical couplings are
present in the adult, but no evidence of cell– cell coupling

was observed following juxtacellular staining of a large
number of individual TRN cells in anaesthetized adult rats
using neurobiotin [195], a junction-permeant tracer [263].
To date, the anatomical substrate of potential synaptic
cell – cell communications in the TRN has not yet been
established. On the basis of light microscope examination of
Golgi-impregnated neurons in adult animals, Scheibel and
Scheibel [226] postulated that dendrodendritic interactions
might take place in the TRN. In line with this hypothesis,
electron microscope analyses in adult cats revealed that
TRN cell dendrites form a local network of symmetric
dendrodendritic synapses [62,110,170,279]. In contrast
few, if any, dendrodendritic synapses have been seen in
the TRN of monkeys [182,273] or rats [137,184] when
examined in single ultrathin sections. However, an analysis
of serial ultrathin sections (60 nm) of dendritic bundles cut
along their longitudinal plane in rat TRN revealed dendrodendritic synapses and numerous nonsynaptic puncta
adhaerentia between component dendrites [204]. The observed dendrodendritic synapses are relatively short ( < 240
nm), making them unlikely to be seen in single sections.
The functional correlates of both the puncta adhaerentia and
the dendrodendritic synapses are unknown.
Puncta adhaerentia represent an intriguing singular morphological characteristic of the TRN. They may be an
important structural substrate for synaptic (electrical and/
or chemical) and non-synaptic functions. Currently, we can
only speculate as to what the functional significance of such
membrane appositions is. For instance, they might increase
extracellular resistance, thereby facilitating non-synaptic
(ionic and/or electric) interactions. Furthermore, if we
assume that the TRN dendrites’ membrane contains unpaired connexon channels, they may operate in at least two
ways: (1) They might form transient gap-junctional intercellular channels, which would be involved in Ca2 +-related
oscillatory activities (see review by Goodenough and Paul
[86]); and/or (2) such hemichannels might be involved in
the control of, for instance, dendritic Ca2 + currents, assuming that these connexons are numerous enough to generate
efficient current sinks [123].
As for the dendrodendritic synapses, they are generally
thought to be involved in lateral inhibition (Fig. 12).
However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that some of
these, perhaps those located in distal dendrites, may be
excitatory since GABA induced depolarizations were
recorded in vitro in TRN cells of young rats [243]. The
excitatory or inhibitory role of GABAergic synapses can be
determined by the value of chloride gradient through the
neurons’ membrane [5,27].
It is currently believed that, in rats [137], ferrets [223]
and in monkeys [273], TRN cells can communicate with
each other by means of axodendritic synapses. However, an
important point to bear in mind is that such synapses have
not yet been demonstrated in a conclusive manner. Lightmicroscope examination of individually labelled TRN neurons suggested that they possess intrinsic beaded axon

17

collaterals and dendrites ending in fine varicose processes
resembling synaptic terminals (‘‘axon-like processes’’) in
rats [243] and cats [139,149,177,260,279]. When using the
electron microscope to examine synaptic inputs on intracellularly labelled cells in the rat TRN, Liu and Jones [137]
identified GABA immunoreactive F terminals, which
formed symmetrical synaptic contacts on cell bodies and
dendrites. Again using the electron microscope, Williamson
et al. [273] observed GABA immunoreactive terminals in
the monkey TRN, which also formed axodendritic and
axosomatic symmetric synaptic contacts. The morphological features of the corresponding presynaptic elements also
resembled F terminals. Since the TRN receives GABAergic
inputs from external sources [11,190], the origin of the F
presynaptic terminals observed in both studies still has to be
determined. On the other hand, when observed at the
ultrastructural level in the rat, the boutons of axon-like
processes that were juxtacellularly labelled in the TRN
had the morphological features of postsynaptic elements
[204].
Furthermore, during the examination of the axonal ramifications of a large number of juxtacellularly labelled TRN
neurons in the adult rat, we noticed that about 10% of these
cells display short-range, poorly ramifying varicose local
axon collaterals, which remained indistinguishable from
parent distal dendrites, raising the question as to whether
their varicosities were presynaptic terminals [204]. Correlated light- and electron-microscope observations of at least
the proximal part of such intrinsic varicose axonal segments
revealed that their varicosities and intervaricose segments
were in fact postsynaptic structures, which were contacted
by a large number of boutons that, for the most part, formed
asymmetric synapses [204]. On the other hand, it has been
reported that, in young rats, about 65% of TRN neurons
give rise to intrinsic axon collaterals [45]. This is entirely
keeping with Scheibel and Scheibel’s observations [225] of
a dense network of intrinsic axon collaterals in Golgistained TRN neuropil of young animals. All these data
suggest therefore that some intrinsic axon collaterals have
the propensity to disappear during brain maturation, possibly as a consequence of an experience-dependent pruning
mechanism, and those that remain might in fact be fine
dendritic ramifications. In conclusion, at least in adult rats
and cats, dendrodendritic junctions seem to be the main
anatomical substrate underlying intercellular communications in the TRN. However, the functions of dendrodendritic
synapses in the TRN still have to be investigated.
Do cells in the visual sector innervate with each other
with axodendritic or dendrodendritic synapses? SanchezVives et al. [223] examined axonal ramifications of biocytin-filled perigeniculate cells in ferrets. They observed
beaded axon collaterals within the internal border of the
perigeniculate nucleus, that is, in the region adjacent to the
visual thalamus’ A lamina, in which the stained TRN axons
profusely arborized. Sanchez-Vives et al. [223] wisely
interpreted their observations by stating as follows in their

PGN cell inhibition demonstrated here may require closer
examination; it will be particularly important to determine
the postsynaptic targets of intra-PGN axon collaterals’’.

11. Cellular electrophysiological properties
Reticular cells are endowed with a set of at least 6
voltage-dependent ionic conductances: two classical for
Na+ and K+, a non-inactivated for Na+, a low-threshold
for Ca2 +, a Ca2 +-dependent for K+ and a Ca2 +-dependent
non-selective cation current [12,14,176,243]. Low-threshold
Ca2 + conductance is well known to underlay high-frequency bursts of up to 15 action potentials (200 –500 Hz) with an
acceleration-deceleration pattern [12,41]. This transient
Ca2 + conductance, which might be generated mainly in
dendrites [64], inactivates much more slowly than that
recorded in TC neurons [109]; furthermore, this low-threshold current of TRN cells has different voltage dependence
features to those recorded in TC neurons.
Single-cell recordings in the TRN of diverse mammals
indicated that it is composed of diverse cellular types
distinguished by their spontaneous firing pattern. During
stereotaxic surgery of parkinsonian patients who where
awake, recorded TRN cells were categorized into three
groups (A, B and C): irregular for type A, short (10 – 30
ms) high-frequency bursts of action potentials (200 – 500
Hz) for type B and long (up to 2s) high-frequency trains of
action potentials for type C [211]. It is possible, however,
that the firing pattern of the latter type was the result of an
injury discharge induced by the metallic microelectrode.
Indeed, the high-frequency character (200 – 500 Hz) of the
corresponding long train discharges of action potentials,
which was unchanged during verbal or sensory stimuli
[210], has never been recorded during experimental studies,
including ones involving unanaesthetized cats (see below).
Type A was no longer observed when the level of consciousness was decreased, that is, during short-term anaesthesia [211], and it was activated in a tonic manner during
the verbal command to perform a movement and during its
execution [210]. The type B was inhibited during the
command presentation whereas it was activated during
motion. Positive cross-correlations were detected during
the simultaneous recordings of two A units whereas the
activities of nearby A and B units were negatively correlated. These results showed the involvement of the TRN in the
transmission of a signal triggering speech-mediated voluntary acts in humans and further emphasized the heterogeneity of the TRN cellular population on the basis of its firing
patterns.
In urethane-anaesthetized adult rats, three categories of
cells were distinguished on the basis of the firing pattern
[197]: (1) cells discharging high-frequency bursts of action
potential (N = 2 –15 at 200– 500 Hz) in isolation or in short
rhythmic sequences at about 10 Hz; (2) other units irregu-

larly discharging single action potential with occasional
bursting episodes; (3) the remaining units (about 34%)
emitting a single action potential in a regular fashion at
25– 60 Hz. The latter cells could switch their firing into the
burst mode and vice versa. Simultaneous recordings of two
nearby cells usually could reveal the absence of synchrony,
even when the cells belonged to a same category. Under
urethane anaesthesia cortical neurons are rather silent [130]
and TC neurons usually exhibit high frequency bursts of
action potential (N = 2 –4 at 200 –500 Hz [201]). So, the fact
that two nearby TRN units, which are supposed to share the
same excitatory and inhibitory inputs, do not display the
same firing pattern at the same time suggests that the
activity of most recorded TRN cells is largely dominated
by their intrinsic properties, which may be different from
one cell to another (see below). This inference is well borne
out by multi-unit recordings conducted in diverse animals,
including in human beings (Fig. 16).
In stereotaxically restrained and unanaesthetized cats,
two types (fast and slow) of TRN cells were recorded [16].
Whereas the slow type fired no more than 15 action
potentials per second during wakefulness or paradoxical
sleep, the fast type had the propensity to fire much above
that frequency. Also, the slow type had an intra-burst
frequency much higher than that of the fast type (158
vs. 62 Hz). In freely moving cats, single-cell recordings in
the caudal part of the TRN revealed that the mean cellular
firing rate, which was in the range of 40 Hz, was nearly
the same during both the waking and the REM sleep states

units. (A) Unit activities recorded with tungsten microelectrodes in the TRN
of dyskinetic patients who are awake [210]. (B) Two adjacent units
recorded with a sharp glass micropipette in the TRN of a neuroleptanalgesied rat [187].

D. Pinault / Brain Research Reviews 46 (2004) 1–31

[175]. In freely moving cats [248] and rats [152], TRN
cells usually fire in the burst mode during sleep episodes
whereas they fire in the single action potential mode
during the waking state; furthermore, during the development of REM sleep these reticular cells have a propensity
to discharge in a more tonic manner than during deep
sleep.
In vivo and in vitro intracellular recordings revealed
two distinct types of TRN cells according to their intrinsic
properties. In cats anaesthetized using urethane, intracellular recordings showed two classes of cells, which were
distinguished by their ability to develop short-lasting (up
to 100 ms) high-frequency bursts of action potential (up to
200 Hz). If they were able to do so they were classed as
bursting cells—type 1—and if they were unable they were
classed as tonic cells—type 2 [40]. Using whole-cell patch
clamp recordings in thalamic slices of young rats, Brunton
and Charpak [28] revealed that, in contrast to type 1, type
2 rarely generated a low-threshold spike at the removal of
hyperpolarizing pulses (Fig. 17). Furthermore intracellular
recordings in guinea pig thalamic slices showed that some
TRN cells had a low-threshold spike (presumably mediated
by Ca2 + conductances), which was partly deinactivated at
the resting membrane potential and did not have a nonactivating Na+ conductance [141].
In addition, as they have a set of powerful intrinsic
ionic conductances, TRN cells can behave like resonators.
For instance, in the study on Genetic Absence Epilepsy
Rats from Strasbourg, spike-and-wave discharges emerged
from TC medium-voltage 5 – 9 Hz oscillations [206].
During absence seizures CT neurons play a primary role
in the synchronized excitation of TC and TRN neurons
[196]. Furthermore, during the generation of the 5– 9 Hz
rhythm TRN cells start to fire robust, high-frequency
bursts of action potential and almost always do so before
TC neurons (Fig. 18A,B). Intracellular recordings revealed
that such TRN bursts are usually caused by a depolarizing
wave (underlain by at least a low-threshold Ca2 + spike),
which is triggered by a barrage of EPSPs principally
induced by CT inputs (Fig. 18D). Because TRN cells
exhibit such synaptically induced intrinsic bursts much
more frequently than TC neurons (Fig. 18A,C,D) (see
also Ref. [205]), they may be considered as powerful
resonators, which are partly responsible, for instance, for
the generation of absence-related spike-and-wave discharges [196].
In conclusion, the powerful intrinsic electroresponsive
properties of TRN cells allow them to switch to any one of
a number of electrophysiological behaviours (see below).
The above-mentioned electrophysiological data indicate
that the TRN contains at least two types of cells, one of
which has a greater ability to generate robust high-frequency bursts of action potential than the other (also see
Ref. [180]). Unfortunately, there are as yet no defined
anatomical and morphological correlates of these two types
of TRN neurons. Because Spreafico et al. [243] could not

record any electrophysiological difference between morphologically distinct cellular types, it might be suggested
that the different electrophysiological properties observed
are correlated with certain network properties. Moreover,
TRN cells are well known as being a principal target of
TC and CT inputs [231]. Furthermore, the electroresponsive properties of TRN cells might also depend on the
neuronal network to which they belong. Indeed, in urethane-anaesthetized rats, TRN cells in the visual sector
were categorized into two types following electrical stimulation of the optic tract [252]: (1) some, which were
selectively excited from area 17 of the visual cortex and
projected to the dorsal lateral geniculate (first-order) nucleus, responded with a short latency (2.3 – 6.1 ms); (2)

others, which were selectively excited from area 18a and
projected to the lateral posterior (higher-order) nucleus,
responded with a longer latency (5.2 – 15.3 ms). The latter
cells were located in the most posterior part of the visual
sector. There is a mean latency difference of 0.7 ms,
suggesting the involvement of one additional synapse
likely due to indirect activation through the superior
colliculus (see discussion by Sumitomo et al. [252]). The
hypothesis that the TRN is composed of various types of

neurons is clearly worth testing at functional, anatomical
and network levels.

12. Thalamocortical oscillations
At the end of the 19th century, Richard Caton [34]
discovered that the brain is an extraordinary machine
producing spontaneous electrical waves. Hans Berger [20]

D. Pinault / Brain Research Reviews 46 (2004) 1–31

characterized the human alpha oscillations, which were
modified by activation of sensory systems. He believed that
electrocortical rhythms were intracortically generated (also
see Refs. [115,214]). Since then several other rhythms have
been recorded in association with the wake –sleep cycle,
with cognitive tasks and/or with clinical disorders (e.g.,
Refs. [18,32,82,135,272]). Studies by Adrian and Matthews
[1] and by Bremer [25] led electrophysiologists to conclude
that rhythms recorded on the brain surface were generated
by deep structures, including the thalamus [6,117,171,
173,209]. Moreover, Jasper [117] considered the thalamus
and the TRN to be the rostral extension of the reticular
activating system identified by Moruzzi and Magoun [173].
During the late 1960s, it was taught that TC oscillations are
accounted for by network properties. Andersen and Andersson [6] proposed that alpha neuronal activities resulted
from inherent properties of interconnected excitatory and
inhibitory neurons, which were presumed to generate a
sequence of synaptic activities. The rhythmic character of
alpha activity was believed to be the result of propagation of
an EPSP –IPSP sequence from one set of interconnected
cells to another. This theory was based upon the discovery
of a powerful recurrent inhibitory system in the thalamus
and the assumption that single neurons cannot generate
rhythmic activities [7].
Since the 1980s, in vitro and in vivo intracellular
recordings of individual neurons have demonstrated that
TC and TRN cells are endowed with intrinsic electrophysiological properties [61,113,142], leading to new concepts
of TC oscillations. More specifically, TC oscillations
mainly reside conceptually in the intrinsic capacity of
neurons to generate oscillatory activities. Moreover, the
Steriade laboratory proposed that the TRN is the pacemaker of sleep spindles because spindle activity was
preserved in the TRN when it was disconnected from
cortical and thalamic inputs [249]. The theory is that the
pacemaker activity of TRN cells is characterized by the
alternance of two main intrinsic currents, IT and I K+(Ca2+),
which have been well characterized in in vitro conditions
[109,114]. However, we should bear in mind that TRN
neurons do not behave electrophysiologically like true
pacemaker cells—like those of the suprachiasmatic nucleus
and of the sinoatrial node—since their intrinsic currents
need adequate inhibitory and/or excitatory activities to
operate in a rhythmic mode without damping. Steriade
and Descheˆnes [246] arrived at the conclusion that the
thalamus is a neuronal oscillator, a theory combining
network and synaptic properties, and intrinsic cell properties. This conclusion has been borne out further by
electrophysiological studies performed on thalamic slices
from ferrets [268] and mice [270]. In particular, it has been
demonstrated from thalamic slices from ferrets that reciprocal functional connections between TC and TRN neurons, which involve synaptic and intrinsic cell properties,
are essential for generating spindle-like thalamic activities
[15,126,268]. This demonstration, which was based on the

21

cutting of connections between TC and TRN neurons, is a
strong counterargument to the proposal that the TRN is an
autonomous structure for generating spindle-like oscillations. Nowadays, the cellular and network mechanisms
responsible for spindle oscillations may be a contentious
issue simply because both the terms ‘‘spindle’’ and ‘‘spindle-like’’ are sometimes used in a misleading fashion.
Indeed, they are used for any kind of TC rhythmic activity
recorded specifically in in vitro conditions (e.g., Refs.
[112,257,268]), whereas true sleep-related spindle oscillations have an intra-spindle frequency of 10 –15 Hz and last
no more than 2 s, at least in humans [181], cats [249] and
rats [80,206].
Furthermore, feline anterior thalamic nuclei do not appear to generate spindle-like activities [176]. Yet, it has been
demonstrated in rodents [84], felines [266] and primates
[129] that the rostral part of the TRN projects to these
anterior nuclei. This is at variance with previous anatomical
and electrophysiological data obtained in the cat [189,247].
Thus, assuming that the TRN is the leading structure in the
generation of sleep-related spindle activity, it may be
questioned whether or not cells projecting into the anterior
thalamus and caudal cells projecting into the dorsal thalamus share similar functional properties.
Nowadays, it is well known that the electrophysiological behaviour of TRN cells varies from one moment to
the next (e.g., Ref. [250]). For instance, in anaesthetized
rats, TRN cells usually display rhythmic burst activity
during medium-voltage synchronized oscillations (Fig. 19).
During these episodes, two burst firing patterns (longlasting 5 – 9 Hz and short-lasting 10– 16 Hz) are easily
distinguishable [206]. Intracellular recordings revealed that
layer VI CT neurons play a leading role in the generation
of 5 – 9 Hz oscillations in the TRN [196]. Thus, the
question is whether the short-lasting 10 – 16 Hz oscillations—which are believed to correspond to spindle-like
activity [206]—are generated by similar cellular and network mechanisms. Additional experimental studies are
required to increase our understanding of the cellular
mechanisms responsible for these two distinguishable
rodent rhythms.
Gamma (20 – 80 Hz) oscillations have been recorded in
the TC system during attentional processes in the cat [24]
and during cognitive tasks in humans [216]. Furthermore, in
the cat, TRN cells discharge in the gamma frequency band
when the animal fixes its attention on a motor task [151]. It
has been demonstrated in anaesthetized rats that the gamma
frequency firing of TRN cells is generated by a voltagedependent mechanism, which operates within a voltage
range close to the action potential triggering threshold
[197], which in turn has also been found in in vitro studies
[14,158]. This intrinsic behaviour operates under the control
of diverse neurotransmitters, including monoaminergic and
cholinergic inputs [198], which are involved in the control
of vigilance [10,56,96,136,275]. However, the role of the
TRN in electro-corticographic gamma activities still has to

Fig. 19. Two distinct reticular burst firing patterns during medium-voltage electrocorticographic (ECoG) oscillations of the related cerebral cortex. (A) Tonic
firing spontaneously alternates with burst firing in neuroleptanalgesied rats. During the occurrence of rhythmic high-frequency bursts of action potentials
(200 – 500 Hz), two patterns are distinguishable (in grey). One (B1) is characterized by a burst frequency of 10 – 16 Hz (auto-correlogram in D1) and never lasts
over 2 s; the other pattern is characterized by a burst frequency of 5 – 9 Hz (auto-correlogram in D2) and usually last well over 2 s. (C1 or C2) Intracellular
recordings reveal that each burst is caused by a depolarizing wave. Adapted from Refs. [196,206].

be determined. Interestingly, high-frequency stimulations of
discrete loci in the auditory and somatosensory sectors of
the TRN evoke gamma oscillations in the related cortical
areas [150].

13. An ideal substrate for selective attention?
That the TRN is involved in attentional processes is
supported by recent findings. McAlonan and Brown [155]
revealed that a given attended conditioned sensory stimulus induces in the corresponding TRN sector a significant
increase of the number of neurons immunoreactive to the

Fos protein. The involvement of the TRN in cognition is
highlighted further following directly and indirectly induced neuronal lesions. Lesions of TRN regions usually
induce forms of behavioural neglect, suggesting that the
TRN is involved in attentional processes [29,39,78,159,
271]. Before the Scheibels’ discovery of the reticulothalamic projections [225], it was believed that TRN axons
project diffusely into the whole cerebral cortex and this led
to the proposal that this diencephalic structure was the
terminal part of the ascending activating system
[36,116,221]. That belief derived from observations that
were mistakenly interpreted as retrograde degeneration
occurring subsequently to cortical lesions [133,220]. Clin-

D. Pinault / Brain Research Reviews 46 (2004) 1–31

ical studies have shown that after severe head injuries, a
selective loss of TRN cells was found in nearly all
examined cases, supporting the notion that loss of TRN
cells might contribute to some cognitive deficits observed
following brain trauma [222].
Because the TRN occupies a strategic position between
the neocortex and the thalamus and controls TC activities
through inhibitory/disinhibitory mechanisms (see Fig. 12), it
has been viewed as a key structure for selective attention for
more than three decades [55,94,120,154,166,197,225,280].
This concept was crystallized by Crick [55] in the form of
‘‘the searchlight hypothesis’’. The notion of an internal
attentional searchlight derives from psychophysical studies
of cognitive mechanisms, particularly those conducted by
Treisman and Gelade [258] and Julesz [121].
What is the ‘‘searchlight’’? According to Francis Crick
[55], the TRN endowed with neurons having extensive
inhibitory axon collaterals, which are supposed to generate
large-scale intra-TRN cellular interactions, and successive
thalamic burst discharges are what is required of a searchlight. This concept is nowadays brought into question by at
least two types, anatomical and functional, of findings
recently available. First, in contrast to the interpretation
of anatomical data obtained from the rapid Golgi method
[225], individual labelling of TRN cells revealed that only
a weak proportion (about 10%) of neurons display shortrange local axon collaterals, whose proximal part have the
ultrastructural properties of postsynaptic structures [204].
Therefore, there is no compelling evidence that these
collaterals are indeed involved in intra-TRN cellular interactions (see Section 10). Second, rhythmic burst activity in
thalamic neurons, which include TRN cells, usually occurs
during states of drowsiness and sleep [248], whereas
attentive wakefulness and cognitive tasks are usually
associated with gamma oscillations in TC systems
[24,151,216]. Such fast oscillations are usually thought
to reflect rhythmic single action potential activity rather
than burst activity, at least in TRN cells [197]. Accordingly, the Crick’s hypotheses that ‘‘the expression of the
searchlight is the production of rapid firing in a subset of
active thalamic neurons’’ and that ‘‘the searchlight is
controlled by the reticular complex of the thalamus’’
should be rethought on the basis of recent cellular and
network findings.
Therefore, it is tempting to place some above-mentioned
anatomical considerations on the scene and to put forward
some ideas, which may help to reformulate the heuristic
concept of Francis Crick, as follows:


Virtually all the functional modalities are represented
within the TRN. Although there appear to be overlaps
between adjacent sectors, one might wonder how, at a
given time, the TRN combines all the modalities required
for a given motor or mental task with the appropriate
individual synaptic capacities. This combination requires,
at the least, widespread and reliable interaction between



remote TRN cells. Because the TRN itself seems unable
to take on such interaction, it is likely that thalamic and
cortical structures at least are also involved.
The fact that a given TRN cell can respond to two
sensory modalities suggests that, during attention, such a
reticular cell might selectively and simultaneously set
various thalamic regions into ‘‘excitation’’, through
inhibitory (e.g., surround inhibition)/disinhibitory mechanisms, thereby shaping the transfer of the multi-modal
TC information that is required by the current brain
processing. Divergences of TRN axonal projections do
exist and appear to be involved in only one functional
modality [49,199,200]. These findings also raise the
question as to whether such diencephalic GABAergic
neurons might be responsible for spatial and temporal
bindings during TC operations.
The closed- and open-loop thalamo-reticulo-thalamic
circuits allow the TRN to shape thalamic activities
through lateral and feedback, GABA-dependent, inhibition mechanisms. These circuits seem to be able to
operate at both modular and global scales. In this way,
subsets of TRN cells are thought to synchronize
subpopulations of TC neurons through oscillatory
mechanisms, and this process is supposed to result in
hotspots in different cortical regions. What binds these
hotspots together during focused attention is still open to
debate.
The TRN controls neuronal activities in a focused manner
within nearly all thalamic nuclei, and it is bombarded by
all the functionally related cortical areas and thalamic
nuclei. Assuming that the TRN is the searchlight operator,
functional data suggest that the operator is probably
driven by layer VI CT inputs [83,167,168,196].
Whatever the TRN sector, most cells have dendrites
spanning more than one tier, and this is probably the result
of a developmental arrangement with TC and CT inputs of
diverse origins (from first-order and higher-order
regions). This suggests that TRN cells can be excellent
integrators of diverse information coming from thalamic
and cortical, first-order and higher-order, regions.
All TRN neurons have powerful intrinsic electrophysiological features. Furthermore, the timing and the pattern
of a cell’s firing can be independent of its neighbours. It
is tempting therefore to speculate that the reason why all
TRN cells are endowed with intrinsic electrophysiological properties is to allow them to fire in a given fashion
at a particular moment, independently of their neighbours. On the basis of the intrinsic and extrinsic
connections of TRN cells, it can be said that any TRN
neuron belongs to more than one neuronal circuit. Every
TRN cell may therefore be a potential elementary
searchlight, which might be able to connect itself to the
appropriate network in which it is required to enter into
action, for instance during focused attention.
Is the searchlight the result of a resonance phenomenon
between the relevant TC systems associated with a given

24

D. Pinault / Brain Research Reviews 46 (2004) 1–31

action? According to current opinion, a searchlight
should be able, at the ms scale, to detect the attentionrelated neuronal demands within, among others, TC
systems and to shape the corresponding thalamic
activities accordingly so that they can reach simultaneously diverse cortical areas responsible for preparing
and for executing the action (cognitive and/or motor
task). The searchlight’s activity is thought to be
ephemeral and combinatory, working both sequential
and in parallel.
 Taken together, the diverse and numerous, in vivo and in
vitro studies conducted in this area have resulted in great
strides in the understanding of some of the anatomical
and functional, cellular and network, properties of the
TRN. Nevertheless, its actual functioning is still far from
being understood. On the basis of the data currently
available, it is tempting to suggest that this diencephalic
GABAergic structure is a set of elementary searchlights,
which are under the permanent control of inputs from the
cortex, the thalamus, the brainstem and the basal
forebrain. Since the TRN innervates several thalamic
nuclei [199,247], since TRN loci can be intermediary
communication sites between two distinct thalamic
nuclei [54], since neighbouring and remote TRN cells
are somehow capable of communicating with each other
[132,223], and since most if not all of these GABAergic
neurons are endowed with powerful, synaptic and
intrinsic, electroresponsive properties [12,177], the
TRN may be viewed as a ‘‘hub’’ [143], marshalling
relevant TC channels required for action.
 Cognitive tasks are generally associated with corticocortical relations, which involve hierarchical neuronal
processing from first-order to higher-order systems
[70,122]. Two conflicting views attempt to explain the
neural bases of cortico-cortical synchronizations. The
first views it as a mechanism involving a feed-back loop
from a common site, which is thought to be the thalamus
[144,216], while the second sees it is a mechanism
involving intracortical lateral connections, including the
corpus callosum [67,68,87,228,238,242]. The hypothesis
that the thalamus is involved in large-scale corticocortical synchronizations is now convincingly supported
by anatomical data [93]. This important matter should be
investigated at the anatomo-functional level.
 The thalamus has long been considered as a gateway to
the cerebral cortex and the TRN as the guardian of that
gateway. On the basis of the currently known anatomical
and functional properties of TRN cells, it is tempting to
submit that such diencephalic GABAergic neurons may
also be involved in large-scale cortico-cortical connections. Indeed, TRN neurons are massively innervated by
cortical inputs arising from layer VI and modulate the
activity of a great number of TC cells within thalamic
nuclei that receive cortical inputs not only from layer VI
but also from layer V [93]. The spatio-temporal
dynamics of the corresponding neuronal interactions

remain, however, to be explored. From a pathological
viewpoint, the TRN should be considered as one key
structure in cognitive deficits, which include those
associated with schizophrenia [229].
At any rate, the exciting Crick’s concept still provides an
incentive for challenging research work relating to all forms
of sensory, motor and cognitive processing. In the context of
our current anatomical knowledge of the TRN, the suggestion of possible existence of several separate searchlights
[55] is interesting.

14. Concluding comments
The TRN is a diencephalic GABAergic nucleus, which is
composed of neuronal elements endowed with diverse
architectural, functional, neurochemical and pharmacological properties. Thus, it might be reasonable to define a TRN
cellular type on the basis of its morphological, anatomical,
neurochemical and physiological properties.
Nowadays, with single-cell electrophysiological studies
conducted in in vitro and in vivo preparations great strides
have been made in the understanding of certain integrative
and oscillatory properties of thalamic neurons. The integrative properties of TRN cells are not well understood,
but it seems that some units can combine more than one
functional modality and submodality, which would allow
them to have control over certain spatial and temporal
bindings involved during global brain operations. Furthermore, it appears that the integrative properties of TRN
cells also depend on the plexus of intercrossing TC and
CT axons. Since TRN cells are involved in both recurrent
and lateral inhibitions, they might have the ability to
generate and to sharpen, in a space continuum, task-related
peaks of increased TC firings reaching the cerebral cortex.
For example, in the sensory systems, TRN cells can
merely shape the receptive field of TC neurons accordingly
to the functional context by adjusting their level of
polarization and excitation through the activation of
GABAA and GABAB receptors. To sum up, TRN cells
might operate as integrators with a wide range of complexity levels.
The reticular and thalamic neurons themselves form
closed-loop and open-loop circuits, which are the anatomical substrata of feedback and lateral GABA-mediated
inhibitions. It is generally thought that GABAergic neurons
usually produce inhibitory effects in their targets, but we
should bear in mind that TRN cells effectively have two
main effects on TC neurons, namely inhibitory and excitatory effects. (1) Thalamocortical GABA A and GABA B
inhibitions that are driven by CT and TC inputs in TRN cells
are the direct post-synaptic result of TRN firings; (2) TRN
cells too can produce indirect excitation, that is, a postinhibitory rebound transient discharge (resulting from a lowthreshold Ca2 + spike) in their target TC cells and/or

D. Pinault / Brain Research Reviews 46 (2004) 1–31

discharge of varying duration in non-target TC cells (e.g.,
through a disinhibition that is presumed to be the counterpart of feedback or lateral inhibition). Furthermore, TRN
cells have powerful intrinsic electrophysiological properties
to fire in an oscillatory mode and to resonate in a wide range
of frequencies; and many studies have demonstrated that the
TRN, which occupies a key position in the TC system, plays
a leading role in the generation of TC-dependent EEG
physiological and pathological oscillations. Furthermore,
the structural substrata of cell – cell communications within
the reticular nucleus are far from being well understood. A
particularity of the TRN is the presence of interwoven
dendrites forming bundles. These might conceal synaptic
(chemical and/or electrical) and non-synaptic mechanisms
of intrinsic cell – cell communications. Whether or not such
intra-nuclear interactions specifically occur between adjacent and/or remote neurons is open to debate.
Another intriguing finding is the potential existence of
two distinct functional cellular types, ‘‘burst’’ and ‘‘tonic’’,
with no apparent correlation with architectural, anatomical,
and neurochemical characteristics. However, we should bear
in mind at least that any bursting cell can switch its firing
into the tonic mode, depending upon its state of polarization.
Whether the converse exists is a fundamental question that
requires further investigation. That two adjacent TRN cells,
which are supposed to share excitatory and inhibitory
inputs, can simultaneously fire in different manners at the
same time is also intriguing. This suggests that every TRN
neuron is endowed with intrinsic electrophysiological properties allowing it to display a firing pattern at a given
moment, thereby defining the status of a given set of TC
neurons.
The reticular nucleus has anatomical and functional
properties that are designed in some way to ensure that
the spatio-temporal dynamics of inter-structure communications are coherent; this occurs ‘‘horizontally’’ within the
thalamus and then ‘‘vertically’’ between the thalamus and
the neocortex, with important consequences for corticocortical relations. In other words, under the influence of
diverse inputs from the cerebral cortex, the thalamus, the
brainstem and from the basal forebrain, the TRN is thought
to be able, at both spatial and temporal scales, to sample and
integrate neuronal attention-related demands and set up the
corresponding TC circuits. Since the TRN includes virtually
all the functional modalities and occupies a strategic position in the highly distributed TC systems, it might act like a
combinatory matrix. Because the latter systems receive
information both from the periphery and from the neocortex,
the TRN might be involved in both bottom-up and top-down
processing.

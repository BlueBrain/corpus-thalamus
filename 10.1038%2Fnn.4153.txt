visual processing

How intracortical recurrent circuits in mammalian sensory cortex influence dynamics of sensory representation is not understood.
Previous methods could not distinguish the relative contributions of recurrent circuits and thalamic afferents to cortical
dynamics. We accomplish this by optogenetically manipulating thalamus and cortex. Over the initial 40 ms of visual stimulation,
excitation from recurrent circuits in visual cortex progressively increased to exceed direct thalamocortical excitation. Even when
recurrent excitation exceeded thalamic excitation, upon silencing thalamus, sensory-evoked activity in cortex decayed rapidly,
with a time constant of 10 ms, which is similar to a neuron’s integration time window. In awake mice, this cortical decay function
predicted the time-locking of cortical activity to thalamic input at frequencies <15 Hz and attenuation of the cortical response
to higher frequencies. Under anesthesia, depression at thalamocortical synapses disrupted the fidelity of sensory transmission.
Thus, we determine dynamics intrinsic to cortical recurrent circuits that transform afferent input in time.
Recurrent excitatory circuits are a hallmark of mammalian sensory cortex. How these recurrent circuits within cortex contribute to processing
sensory information is still a matter of debate. While progress has been
made in understanding how intracortical recurrent circuits combine
sensory information in space1–4, still very little is known about how
they influence sensory-evoked activity in time. Revealing how cortical circuits affect the temporal representation of neural activity has
implications for our mechanistic understanding of perception and
cognition. The impact of cortical recurrent circuits is difficult to predict. If one population of cortical neurons drives a second population
of cortical neurons and that second population also drives the first,
self-sustaining activity may result, prolonging the sensory-evoked
response in cortex. However, different levels of cortical inhibition,
which counteracts cortical recurrent excitation, may lead to different
durations of the sensory response in cortex5–7. Thus, the following
question must be addressed empirically: does the recruitment of
cortical recurrent circuits by a sensory stimulus affect the representation of that stimulus in time, and, if so, by what mechanism?
Answering this question has been technically challenging. The
cortex receives its primary source of sensory input from the thalamus via thalamic afferents to cortex, and the cortex projects back to
thalamus. This reciprocal interaction between thalamus and cortex
could alter the cortical representation of sensory activity in time.
Hence, to determine how intracortical recurrent circuits themselves
affect sensory activity in time, we must factor out the thalamic contribution to the duration and dynamics of the sensory response.
Previous attempts to determine how cortical circuits affect sensory
activity in time compared the spiking response in thalamus with the
spiking response in cortex8–16. However, the synapses of thalamic
afferents connecting thalamus to cortex exhibit their own dynamic

properties, like frequency-dependent short-term depression, which
may affect the sensory response of the cortex17–20.
But how can we determine the dynamics of intracortical recurrent
circuits in response to sensory stimulation in isolation from the thalamic afferents, given that activity in these thalamic afferents is needed
to trigger a response in cortical recurrent circuits? Using the thalamocortical visual system of the mouse as a model, we have developed
an optogenetic method to silence, with millisecond precision, visual
thalamus at any arbitrary delay following the presentation of a visual
stimulus. This approach allows us to follow the duration of visually
evoked activity continuing in intracortical recurrent circuits in the
absence of thalamic input and thus to directly measure sensory-evoked
dynamics intrinsic to recurrent circuits of cortex. To test whether our
measurement can predict the temporal transformation of sensory
activity by cortex, we then compare the spiking response of cortex
with the output of thalamic afferent synapses detected in isolation
from the cortical recurrent circuits by silencing these recurrent circuits
using a second, complementary optogenetic technique. This multifocal
and multifunctional optogenetic approach thus identifies the relative
contributions of thalamic afferent versus cortical recurrent connections
to the temporal processing of visual information (Fig. 1a).
We found that the intrinsic dynamics of cortical recurrent circuits
in response to sensory stimulation are on the order of the integration
time window of a single cortical neuron. Furthermore, through
experiments engaging different optogenetic actuators in different
brain areas within the same mouse to silence thalamus while also
altering cortical inhibition, we found that cortical inhibition affects
these cortical recurrent circuit dynamics. Moreover, we show that,
in awake mice, these dynamics of cortical recurrent circuits predict
how visual cortex transforms sensory input in time. Thus, the cortical

RESULTS
Time course of intracortical versus thalamic excitation
To study the impact of intracortical recurrent circuits on the temporal
structure of the sensory response, we needed to establish recurrent
circuits’ contributions to the sensory response
over time. To do this, we recorded visually

mediated by cortical recurrent circuits (cortical fraction) by comparing the excitatory
postsynaptic current (EPSC) under control conditions with the EPSC observed on interleaved

trials in which recurrent excitatory circuits were silenced (Fig. 1b). We
silenced recurrent excitatory circuits by optogenetically activating cortical inhibitory interneurons, as described previously21. Hence, during
this manipulation, the remaining excitation to cortical neurons is direct,
feedforward input from thalamus21. Silencing recurrent circuits abolished most (79 ± 9%, mean ± s.e.m., as a fraction of the total integrated
response, n = 8 cells, 1.7-s-long stimuli; Fig. 1b and Supplementary
Fig. 1) visually evoked synaptic excitation to cortical neurons in layer 4,
the main thalamic afferent recipient layer22, consistent with previous work in rodents and carnivores21,23,24. The total synaptic
excitatory current, including both cortical recurrent and direct
thalamic components, peaked 150 ms after the onset of visually evoked excitation and decayed slowly over the next 1.35 s.

recurrent circuit dynamics limit the rate of the sensory response in
the awake state. Notably, our data also indicate that, under anesthesia,
the dynamics of synaptic depression at thalamic afferents, rather
than the dynamics of cortical recurrent circuits, are rate-limiting
in sensory processing, leading to a pronounced disruption of
the timing of the sensory response in the nonconscious state. We
suggest that the interplay of these mechanisms is a general principle
of thalamocortical interaction.

The direct thalamic excitation to layer 4 was dominant over the first
several tens of milliseconds of the response (time until thalamic fraction was less than 50% of total instantaneous EPSC amplitude: 43 ±
6.5 ms, mean ± s.e.m., n = 25; over the first 10 ms, 82 ± 4% of excitation was of direct thalamic origin, as a fraction of the total integrated
response; Fig. 1b). The fraction of excitation dependent on cortical
recurrent circuits (cortical fraction) grew progressively from 0% to
72 ± 6% (as a fraction of the instantaneous EPSC amplitude, n = 25,
including 1.7-s-long and 250-ms-long stimuli) over the first 250 ms of
the response, overwhelming the direct thalamic component. Thus, by
250 ms, cortical circuits amplified the thalamic input more than threefold. Therefore, in response to visual stimulation, the contribution of
cortical recurrent excitation progressively builds up to overwhelm the
contribution of direct thalamic excitation to visual cortex.
If the cortical neurons in recurrent circuits are the source of the
cortical component of the excitatory synaptic current, the spiking of
neurons in visual cortex should follow a time course similar to that
of cortical synaptic excitation. Over the first 800 ms of the response,
multi-unit and single-unit activity across all cortical layers detected
with extracellular linear probes (Online Methods) had a time course
comparable to that of recurrent synaptic excitation (Fig. 1c). Thus,
powerful recurrent excitation from other spiking cortical neurons
is larger in magnitude than the direct thalamic input after the first
several tens of ms of the evoked response in V1.

Silencing thalamic input to visual cortex
Once recurrent excitation builds up in V1, over what timescale do
cortical recurrent circuits alone sustain the sensory response in the
absence of continued thalamic input? To answer this, we needed to
precisely gate thalamic input to cortex. We developed an optogenetic approach to rapidly silence thalamic input at any arbitrary time
following the onset of a sensory response in visual cortex. Unlike
electrically or optogenetically25 stimulating thalamic afferents, which
recruits a random population of afferents, our method allowed us
to measure the duration of activity reverberating through cortical
recurrent circuits in response to actual visual stimuli.
To gate thalamic input, we exploited the inhibitory projection
from the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which does not itself
project to cortex, onto relay nuclei of thalamus (such as the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN)), which transmit sensory
activity to cortex. We conditionally expressed Channelrhodopsin 2
(ChR2), a light-activated cation channel, conditionally on Cre
recombinase expression in the TRN 26 using Gad2-Cre mice
(expressing Cre in GABAergic cells; Fig. 2a,b and Online Methods).
Photo-activating the TRN (step pulse, 470 nm) rapidly and powerfully suppressed visually evoked (>96%) and spontaneous
(>88%) activity in the dLGN of anesthetized mice (Fig. 2c; 3.7 ms

Online Methods). TRN photo-activation also suppressed activity

in the lateral posterior nucleus, the second-order visual thalamic
nucleus in rodents (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
Decay of evoked cortical activity after silencing thalamus
We measured multi-unit activity in visual cortex of anesthetized mice
after rapidly silencing thalamus. Silencing thalamus in the absence of
visual stimulation had no effect on cortical spontaneous active states,
called Up states (Fig. 2d,e and Supplementary Fig. 2b)—bouts of
high activity occurring spontaneously in the anesthetized cortex—
indicating that cortical recurrent circuits can generate and sustain
spiking activity for several hundreds of milliseconds in the absence
of thalamic input, consistent with previous work27,28. We triggered
sensory-evoked active states in cortex using the static visual stimuli
described above (as in Fig. 1). These sensory-evoked active states
decayed slowly after removal of the visual stimulus, continuing for
several hundreds of milliseconds (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1d).
If cortical recurrent circuits sustain this slowly decaying activity, then
silencing thalamus should have little effect on the time course of this
decay. Notably, silencing thalamus 250 ms into the sensory-evoked
response led to a decay of visually evoked activity in V1 that was more
than two orders of magnitude faster than the decay observed following
simply the removal of the visual stimulus (Fig. 2f and Supplementary
Fig. 2; compare Fig. 1). We call the time course of this decay of cortical
activity after silencing thalamus the cortical decay function (CDF).
The CDF was fit by an exponential time constant of 9 ± 3 ms (mean ±
s.d.; n = 26 mice; Fig. 2f), with 3 ms delay before the start of the exponential to account for the time it takes thalamus to shut off (Online
Methods, Supplementary Fig. 2c). Thus, even after the build-up
of cortical recurrent excitation in response to sensory stimulation,
cortical recurrent circuits sustain sensory-evoked activity for only a
few tens of milliseconds without thalamic input.
We verified that this fast CDF was not influenced by off-target
expression of ChR2 in visual cortex interneurons and that ChR2
expression in TRN axons to dLGN was the main histologic correlate of
the shut-off of visually evoked activity in V1 (Supplementary Fig. 3,
Online Methods). The CDF was fast across all V1 layers, even those
that do not receive the main thalamocortical input (Supplementary
Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 1), although we did observe
subtle but significant differences across layers (mean fit to CDF

L5a: 8.9 ± 1.3 ms, L5b: 15.7 ± 2.5 ms, L6: 7.6 ± 1.5 ms; P values in
Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, although it has been suggested that slow cortical sensory-evoked dynamics emerge at low contrast29, we found that the CDF was independent of stimulus contrast
(Supplementary Fig. 1e). The CDF was also the same at later time
points in the visual response (300, 600 and 900 ms after stimulus onset;
Supplementary Fig. 1e), demonstrating that cortical sensory-evoked
activity locks to thalamic input over the full time course of the sensory response. Moreover, the CDF was independent of strength of the
thalamic silencing (Supplementary Fig. 1e), indicating that cortex
exhibits the same fast sensory-evoked dynamics even when partial
thalamic drive remains.
Consistent with the multi-unit data, the average CDF of visually responsive, isolated single units in V1 was fit by a 12 ± 1 ms
time constant (mean ± s.e.m., n = 297 units from all cortical layers; Supplementary Fig. 1f,g). Furthermore, most (>90% of) single
units considered individually had fast CDFs (time constant < 20 ms;
Fig. 2g,h and Supplementary Fig. 2), and only a small minority in
layer 5 were a few tens of ms slower. Are the neurons that exhibit
spontaneous Up states part of a different subnetwork than neurons
responsive to visual stimulation? No, many of the visually responsive
units also participated in Up states, indicating that thalamus-locked
sensory activity and thalamus-independent Up states engage many
of the same neurons in the cortical circuits (Fig. 2i), despite marked
differences in the dynamics of these two types of cortical activity.
Taken together, these results show that, even at time points
when cortical recurrent circuits generate the majority of visually
evoked synaptic excitation (that is, more than 43 ms after the onset
of the visually evoked response; Fig. 1), activity in cortical recurrent
circuits time-locks to thalamic input. Hence, cortical recurrent
circuits have fast dynamics.
Previous work suggests that dynamics in recurrent circuits might be
very different between the anesthetized and awake brain states27,30,31
and between primary and higher order cortical areas32. We found that
the CDF was similar in awake mice (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary
Fig. 4; awake: 10 ± 3 ms, mean ± s.d., n = 9 mice; anesthesia: 9 ± 3 ms,
n = 26 mice; unpaired P = 0.15—all CDF comparisons in text are

and discussion of normality; t-tests assumed that CDF distribution
was normal and that variances were equal across groups, but this was
not formally tested), even when mice were running, a behavior that
increases the gain of V1’s response33 (running: 9 ± 6 ms, stationary:
10 ± 6 ms, n = 4 mice; paired P = 0.16; Supplementary Fig. 4c).
Furthermore, in contrast to Up states under anesthesia, spontaneous cortical activity in awake mice decreased after silencing thalamus (73 ± 7% decrease in single-unit baseline, mean ± s.e.m.; Fig. 3c
and Supplementary Fig. 4b) at a rapid rate consistent with the CDF
(Fig. 3c; awake spontaneous CDF: 14 ± 4 ms, n = 7 mice), indicating
that spontaneous cortical activity in awake mice relies on ongoing
thalamic input. Also, the CDF was only a few milliseconds slower
in a higher order area of visual cortex (Fig. 3d; awake V2 lateral,
Online Methods; V2 CDF: 16 ± 5 ms, n = 3 mice, unpaired versus
V1 P = 0.003). Thus, visually evoked activity in cortical recurrent
circuits locks to the timing of the thalamic input even in awake
conditions and secondary visual areas (Supplementary Fig. 4
and Supplementary Table 1).

sensory response, then cortex should precisely follow fast fluctuations
in sensory activity up to ~15 Hz but increasingly attenuate
frequencies above ~15 Hz, the frequency cutoff predicted by the filtering properties of the ~10 ms CDF (Online Methods).
We determined V1’s ability to follow the timing of sensory activity from thalamus by measuring the spike rate response to spatially
uniform, full-field fluctuations of luminance (flicker) as a function of flicker temporal frequency between 1 and 60 Hz, called the
frequency response, in dLGN and V1 (Fig. 4a; Online Methods).
In contrast to the prediction by the CDF, however, under anesthesia
V1 could not follow visually evoked thalamic activity at frequencies
above ~6 Hz (Fig. 4b,c, left). This low-pass filtering of the sensory
response by V1 is consistent with previous measurements of V1’s
frequency response34 but implies a rate-limiting step between thalamus and cortex markedly slower than our ~10 ms CDF. This lowpass filtering was already pronounced in layer 4 (Supplementary
Fig. 5a), V1’s main thalamo-recipient layer, indicating that the
filtering of the sensory response occurs very early, as visually
evoked activity enters the cortex.
A candidate source of low-pass filtering of the sensory response
under anesthesia is frequency-dependent depression of thalamocortical (TC) afferent synapses17,18,20,35,36, a progressive depression
of synaptic strength as the frequency of thalamic activity increases.


If present, this process would preferentially attenuate the cortical response to high-frequency thalamic activity. We measured TC
depression in our preparation in vivo under anesthesia (Fig. 4d).
To do this, we optogenetically silenced cortical recurrent excitatory
circuits, as in Figure 1, while recording field excitatory postsynaptic
potentials (fEPSPs) in layer 4, which under these conditions represent TC transmission (Fig. 1 and described previously21). These TC
fEPSPs showed strong frequency-dependent depression, quantified
as the decrease in response amplitude over a train of visual stimuli
(each stimulus a flash of 10 ms duration, train of 10 stimuli) relative
to the amplitude of the first response (normalized by the response
amplitude in thalamus; see Online Methods for details; Fig. 4e, left).
Notably, the measured frequency dependence of the TC fEPSPs
accounted quantitatively for V1’s low-pass filtering of thalamic input
under anesthesia (Fig. 4f).
If this TC depression underlies the low-pass filtering of V1’s
response under anesthesia, conditions reducing TC depression
should improve V1’s ability to follow high-frequency thalamic input.
We observed that frequency-dependent TC depression in layer
4 disappeared as animals woke up from anesthesia (Fig. 4e, right; for
a potential mechanism, see Supplementary Fig. 6) (refs. 17,18,20,36).
Thus, if TC depression impairs V1’s ability to follow high-frequency
stimulation under anesthesia, then in awake mice, relief from TC
depression should enable V1 to better follow high-frequency thalamic
activity, up to the cutoff predicted by the CDF.
CDF predicts amplitude of visual responses in awake mice
Waking the animals led to a markedly stronger V1 response to
thalamic activity at temporal frequencies above ~6 Hz (Fig. 4b,c,
right). Furthermore, consistent with our previous measurements of
recurrent circuit dynamics in visual cortex, the response attenuation
in V1 in awake mice precisely matched the attenuation between thalamus and cortex predicted by the CDF (Fig. 4b,c, right). Combining
(convolving) the CDF with dLGN’s frequency response successfully

predicted V1’s frequency response measured in terms of amplitude during both high (100%) and low (20%) contrast visual flicker
(Fig. 4c, right, and Supplementary Fig. 5; for additional filtering
properties of CDF, including subtle theta-band amplification37,
also observed in cats31, see Supplementary Fig. 7). In awake mice,
the cortex exhibited increasing attenuation of sensory-evoked thalamic activity above ~15 Hz, attenuating two-thirds of the amplitude
of the thalamic input at 30 Hz, in accordance with the CDF prediction.
Notably, combining dLGN’s frequency response with a time constant
ten times faster or slower than the 10 ms fit to the CDF failed to
predict V1’s frequency response (Fig. 4g).
Thus, in awake mice, the dynamics of recurrent circuits predict
how V1 attenuates the amplitude of a temporally modulated thalamic input. But what fraction of V1’s total response in awake mice
is actually explained by this simple model of input attenuation? To
answer this precisely, we performed dual simultaneous extracellular
recordings in dLGN and V1 to measure response coherence between
these structures. We found that dLGN’s average multi-unit response
convolved with the CDF explained 53% of V1’s average multi-unit
response between 1 and 30 Hz (Supplementary Fig. 5f). Furthermore,
both fundamental (at the temporal frequency of the stimulus, 65%
of total V1 response amplitude) and first-harmonic (twice the
temporal frequency of the stimulus, 35% of total) components of the
visual response were attenuated at high frequencies in V1 regularspiking units in a manner quantitatively consistent with filtering
by the CDF (Supplementary Fig. 8). Thus, these data suggest that,
in awake mice and therefore in the absence of low-pass filtering by
thalamic afferent synapses, dynamics of cortical recurrent circuits are
the key constraint on V1’s response to sensory activity from thalamus.
As further validation of how brain state affects the temporal transformation of sensory activity between thalamus and cortex, deconvolution of dLGN’s spiking response to the flicker stimulus from V1’s
response, an analysis that measures the combined effects of both TC
afferent synapse and cortical recurrent circuit dynamics, showed slow

dynamics under anesthesia but faster dynamics in the awake state
(Supplementary Fig. 5c).
Cortical decay function depends on inhibition
What mechanism regulates the dynamics of recurrent circuits to
prevent prolonged reverberation of cortical activity after thalamic
input ends? Certain models5,7 propose that cortical inhibition balances strong recurrent excitation to damp sensory activity. To test
the role of cortical inhibitory interneurons in setting the fast CDF,
we expressed the light-activated proton pump ArchT38 in V1’s
inhibitory interneurons (Cre-dependent ArchT, Gad2-Cre mice)
to suppress their activity by application of amber (595 nm) light
(Fig. 5a,b). During the suppression of cortical GABAergic interneurons, we photo-activated the ChR2-expressing TRN in the same mice
to silence the thalamus (473 nm light from the fiber above TRN).
We performed these experiments in anesthetized mice because
disinhibition of cortex in awake mice led to runaway activity39.
Suppressing cortical interneurons on interleaved trials increased
the gain of V1’s evoked response by 47% (Fig. 5c), consistent with
previous reports39, and slowed the CDF by 263% (Fig. 5d–f and
Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10a–c; single exponential fit changes
from 8 ± 2 ms to 21 ± 7 ms; n = 5 mice, paired P = 0.01). This lengthening of the CDF originated in cortex, because suppressing cortical
interneurons did not affect the rate of dLGN silencing (paired P = 0.78;
Fig. 5g) or cortical sensitivity to thalamic input differentially at
low levels of input (Supplementary Fig. 10d). Furthermore, this
lengthening of the CDF was not due to increased gain of the V1
response per se, because under conditions of normal cortical inhibition the CDF is not affected by the gain of the V1 response (that
is, across stimulus contrasts or behavioral states; Supplementary
Figs. 2e and 4 and Supplementary Table 1). Hence, cortical inhibition contributes to enforcing fast recurrent circuit dynamics,
which are essential to lock the duration of recurrent excitation to the
timing of thalamic input.
Prolonging the CDF predictably alters V1’s visual response
The CDF predicts that V1 can readily follow thalamic frequencies up
to ~15 Hz but attenuates thalamic frequencies above ~15 Hz. If V1’s
ability to rapidly follow high-frequency thalamic input is constrained
by the CDF, prolonging the CDF should reduce V1’s response to highfrequency fluctuations of thalamic activity. To test a causal role for
the CDF in rate-limiting V1’s response to high-frequency input, we
prolonged the CDF by suppressing cortical interneurons in visual
cortex of anesthetized mice, as described above. Because in anesthetized mice TC depression attenuates the cortical response to repeated
high-frequency visual stimulation (Fig. 4), we tested the effects of
prolonging the CDF at the onset of high-contrast visual stimulation,
when thalamic activity increases rapidly and before TC depression
develops. Prolonging the CDF lengthened V1’s onset response to an
extent predicted by the measured change in the CDF (Supplementary
Fig. 10e). Control experiments to change the gain of V1’s response
without prolonging the CDF did not lengthen V1’s onset response
(Supplementary Fig. 10f). Thus, changing the CDF changes cortical
dynamics. Taken together, these results show that the CDF of visual
cortex is fast enough to temporally lock the cortical response to the
timing of sensory-evoked thalamic activity.
DISCUSSION
Cortical dynamics are fundamental to sensation and cognition. These
dynamics are sculpted by intracortical recurrent circuits, which dominate the anatomy of both associative and sensory cortical areas22,40.
nature NEUROSCIENCE  advance online publication	

In sensory areas, these recurrent circuits provide the majority of sensory-evoked excitation to cortical neurons21,23,24. How these recurrent
circuits influence the duration and dynamics of the response in sensory areas is still not known. Here we measure directly the dynamics intrinsic to recurrent circuits in visual cortex in isolation from
dynamics at thalamic afferents. We demonstrate that the dynamics
of these cortical recurrent circuits are on the order of the integration
time window of a single cortical neuron (~10 ms)41. Furthermore,
we establish that these dynamics are a fundamental constraint on the
temporal response of cortex to visual stimulation (Supplementary
Fig. 11) and precisely predict the amplitude attenuation of the cortical
response in awake mice over a wide range of stimulus frequencies.
By optogenetically dissecting intracortical and thalamic contributions to the sensory response, we found that the prolonged timescale
of continuing sensory-evoked activity in visual cortex after removal
of the sensory stimulus is a product, not of cortical recurrent circuits,
but of thalamocortical communication. Therefore, thalamocortical
interactions are necessary for long-lasting responses in visual cortex.
In higher cortical areas, even longer-lasting sensory responses have
been observed32,42 and are often attributed to intrinsic dynamics of
cortical recurrent circuits43,44. Our work thus raises the possibility
that long-lasting responses in higher cortical areas arise from thalamocortical interactions rather than cortical recurrent circuits45.
However, consistent with our suggestion that inhibition may modulate intrinsic dynamics of cortical recurrent circuits, it is also plausible
that different relative properties of inhibition and excitation lead to
different intrinsic dynamics of the recurrent circuits in these higher
cortical areas. Our approach will allow researchers to measure these
intrinsic dynamics across cortical areas.
Our results reveal that thalamocortical communication is necessary
to sustain sensory-evoked activity in visual cortex over timescales
longer than a few tens of milliseconds. The duration of the response
in thalamus may be set by input from peripheral sensory structures 46
or by corticothalamic feedback45.
We found that cortical recurrent circuits provide the majority
of synaptic excitation to cortical neurons only after an initial transient excitation from thalamus, which dominates the first 43 ms of
the response, at least under anesthesia. If this also holds true in the
awake state, this initial transient excitation from thalamus might be
particularly relevant to natural viewing conditions producing rapid
transitions of visual input47,48.
What mechanism(s) ensure a rapid decay of sensory-evoked
activity in intracortical-recurrent circuits after silencing thalamus?
Notably, the CDF was invariant to changes in stimulus strength
(for example, stimulus contrast or size), consistent with the CDF’s
ability to predict the amplitude of the cortical response across stimulus contrasts and temporal frequencies. Existing models of cortex
achieve dynamics invariant to stimulus strength by assuming that
local inhibition counteracts recurrent excitation to preserve the
speed of the response5,7. Here we empirically test this assumption and
find evidence that an appropriate ratio of excitation and inhibition
contributes to the invariance of the CDF. However, additional mechanisms, including the biophysical membrane properties of cortical
neurons, the dynamics of cortico-cortical synapses and these synapses’ specific connectivity patterns may also critically contribute
to the fast CDF. Future experiments that modulate specific types of
interneurons in cortex will be required to understand exactly how
inhibition contributes to the CDF.
Our approach also provides a mechanism for how anesthesia disrupts the timing of the cortical response, despite the CDF’s invariance
to anesthesia. We find that marked depression of thalamocortical

synapses under anesthesia disrupts the transmission of high-frequency
sensory activity to cortex. In the awake state, however, thalamocortical synapses do not depress over a train of repeated visual stimuli
and thus transmit both low and high frequencies of sensory activity
equally well. Our data suggest a possible explanation for this difference between the anesthetized and awake states. We observed
increased spontaneous activity in thalamus in the awake state, which
is likely to ‘pre-depress’ the thalamocortical synapses before visual
stimulation so no further depression is observed during visual
stimulation19. If this brain state–specific switch in thalamocortical
communication generalizes to other cortical areas, it might underlie the distinction between the awake and non-conscious states.
Consistent with the effects of anesthesia, nonalert awake states
show higher thalamocortical synaptic depression than alert awake
states20,36, suggesting that reduced thalamocortical transmission
of high temporal frequencies is not just specific to anesthesia. It is
likely to represent a normal mode of brain function correlated with
reduced alertness or inattention.
Moreover, the increase in spontaneous thalamic activity as animals wake up from anesthesia is likely to also explain our finding
that the majority of spontaneous cortical activity in the awake
state depends on thalamic input, from either dLGN or higher
order thalamic nuclei, such as the lateral posterior, which was also
silenced by our approach.
Thus, pre-depression of thalamocortical synapses in the awake
state, along with an appropriate balance of excitation and inhibition in recurrent circuits, seems to enable the sensitivity of visual
cortex to stimulus frequencies up to 30 Hz, consistent with the
perceptual cutoff in mice49 and humans. Many neurologic disorders with strong perceptual alterations, such as schizophrenia and
autism, have been considered to be, in part, disruptions of the balance
between excitation and inhibition in cortex50. The resulting change
in the intrinsic dynamics of cortical recurrent circuits may account,
in part, for the observed perceptual alterations. Understanding the
mechanistic source of such alterations in brain dynamics should
allow us to better target interventions. More generally, a mechanistic
understanding of cortical dynamics will be vital to understanding
various processes underlying cognition.

ONLINE METHODS

Animal protocols. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health guidelines and with the approval of the Committee
on Animal Care at UCSD (protocol S02160M). Animals were housed on a reverse
light cycle in cages of four mice or less. At the time of electrophysiology, all animals were older than 3.5 weeks. Both male and female animals were used in an
approximately equal ratio.
Mouse lines. Gad2-Cre (Jackson Labs stock number: 010802) × C57Bl6
(ref. 51), vGat-ChR2 (Jackson Labs stock number: 014548)52, Scnn1a-Tg3Cre (Jackson Labs stock number: 009613)53 and PV-Cre (Jackson Labs stock
number: 008069)54.

Viruses. AAV2/1.CAGGS.flex.ChR2.tdTomato.SV40 (Addgene 18917)55 from
the University of Pennsylvania viral vector core. AAV2/9.CAG.flex.Arch.GFP38
from the University of North Carolina viral vector core.
Animal surgery: viral injections. Stereotactic viral injections of TRN. We stereotactically injected AAV2/1.CAGGS.flex.ChR2.tdTomato.SV40 into the thalamic
reticular nucleus (TRN) of adult Gad2-Cre × C57Bl6 transgenic mice. Mice were
anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and placed into a Kopf stereotax. Core body
temperature was maintained at just above 35 °C for the duration of the surgery
with an FHC rectal probe and a heating pad. Lubricating ointment (Artificial
Tears) was applied to the eyes, the head was shaved, and the skin was sterilized
with alcohol and povidone-iodine before exposing and stereotactically flattening
the skull. We made a small craniotomy (approx. 50 µm in diameter above the
somatosensory cortex, 1,540 µm posterior and 2,235 µm lateral to the bregma),
inserted a thin pipette containing virus to 400 µm beneath the final target
injection site (final target site: 1,540 µm posterior, 2,235 µm lateral, 3,158 µm
ventral to the bregma), returned the pipette tip to the final target injection site,
and pressure-injected 200 nL of the virus (titer: 6.86 × 1012 genome copies/mL)
into the TRN, at an injection speed of 30 nL/min. We removed the pipette only
10–15 min after completion of the injection to reduce the spread of virus along
the pipette track. We administered a single dose of 10% buprenorphrine as a
postoperative analgesic, sutured the skin, applied povidone-iodine, and waited
2 weeks before recording.
Viral injections into V1 of Gad2-Cre mice. AAV2/9.CAG.flex.Arch.GFP or
AAV2/1.CAGGS.flex.ChR2.tdTomato.SV40 was injected into V1 of adult Gad2Cre × C57Bl6 transgenic mice. The virus injection surgery was the same as above.
However, for the AAV2/9.CAG.flex.Arch.GFP injections, we made three small
craniotomies (<50 µm each in diameter) in a triangular pattern tiling the extent of
mouse V1 and performed three pressure injections of 125 nL each (titer: 6 × 1012
genome copies/mL), at a depth of between 400 and 600 µm, at a speed of
30 nL/min, and waiting 10–15 min between injection sites. We recorded
4–6 weeks after injection. For AAV2/1.CAGGS.flex.ChR2.tdTomato.SV40
injections, we made a single craniotomy over the center of V1 (<50 µm in
diameter) and injected 200 nL (titer: 6.86 × 1012 genome copies/ml) of the
virus at a depth of 400–600 µm. We recorded 2 weeks after injection.
Viral injections into V1 of PV-Cre mice. PV-Cre animals were injected at
postnatal day 0–1 with AAV2/1.CAGGS.flex.ChR2.tdTomato.SV40 (see ref. 21
for pup injection methods).
Animal surgery: terminal experiments under anesthesia. During our surgical
preparation of a mouse for electrophysiological recording, we maintained an anesthetic depth such that the mouse did not respond to a toe pinch, using either 2%
gas isoflurane plus 2 mg/kg chlorprothixene (intraperitoneal injection), 2% gas
isoflurane alone, or 0.5–1% isoflurane plus 1.5 g/kg urethane diluted to 0.1 g/ml
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; i.p. injection). We covered the animal’s
eyes in transparent seed oil. After shaving the head and sterilizing the skin,
we removed the skin and fascia, scored the skull with a bone scraper, and secured
a metal head-frame to the skull using dental cement (Ortho-Jet) mixed with
black paint, which prevents light during optogenetic stimulation from penetrating the dental cement. We allowed the cement to set for at least 30 min
before drilling the skull.
Craniotomies and thinned skulls in anesthetized preparations. For photoactivation of TRN, we made a large circular craniotomy (diameter approx.
1.25 mm, 1,540 µm posterior and 2,235 µm lateral to the bregma) above the TRN.

nature NEUROSCIENCE

We then used a cautery to make a hole in the brain tissue above the TRN and
inserted an optical fiber (1 mm diameter) to an approximate depth of 1.25 mm,
through the somatosensory cortex and part of the hippocampus at 1.54 mm
posterior, 2.235 mm lateral and 1.5 mm ventral to the bregma. We verified that
this acute insertion of the fiber optic did not affect our results by (i) confirming
all results in a subset of anesthetized mice in which we used a smaller, 250-µmdiameter fiber optic inserted more than a week earlier (see “Animal surgery:
awake recordings”) and (ii) verifying that the CDF and extent of shut-off of V1
activity did not change over the course of long anesthetized recordings (>1 h).
For V1 whole-cell recordings, we made a circular craniotomy of 1–2 mm
diameter over V1 and removed the dura using the bent tip of a 27- or 30-gauge
needle. The cortical surface was covered in 1.5–2% agarose dissolved in artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF).
For V1 extracellular recordings, we made a small craniotomy (diameter approx.
50 µm) above V1.
For thalamic extracellular recordings, we made a craniotomy above dLGN and
the lateral posterior nucleus (diameter: 200–300 µm; approx. 1.8 mm posterior
and 2 mm lateral to the bregma).
For photo-activation of ArchT in V1, we thinned the skull in the approximately 1.5 × 1.5 mm square overlying visual cortex. We covered the brain in
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF: 142 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM d-glucose,
10 mM HEPES sodium salt, 3.1 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) and inserted
the recording electrode. During the recording, we reduced the level of isoflurane
to 0.9–1% (or less when combined with urethane).
Animal surgery: awake recordings. We fitted animals with a head frame for
awake recordings more than a week before the day of the recording.
Head-frame surgery. We anesthetized animals with 2% isoflurane. After we
shaved and sterilized the head, we cut off the skin and scored the skull using a
bone scraper and surgical blade, which removes the soft upper layer of bone.
We glued the edge of the skin to the skull using VetBond. We then inserted two
bone screws bilaterally at 0.75 mm anterior and 2 mm lateral to the bregma.
We used black dental cement to attach a metal head frame to the skull.
Cannulation. For optogenetic silencing of the thalamus, during the head-frame
surgery, we also inserted a metal cannula (a guide for the optical fiber) with an
outer diameter of 460 µm through the skull and brain to a depth of 2,375 µm
beneath the bregma, just above the TRN at coordinates 1.54 mm posterior
and 2.235 mm lateral to the bregma. The bottom of this cannula was angled
45 degrees and beveled to provide a clean, sharp edge for penetrating the brain
tissue. Also, the bottom of the cannula was sealed with a clear window of Kwik-Sil
that permanently separated the inside of the cannula from the brain. At the time
of the recording, we inserted an optical fiber into this cannula and optically stimulated through this clear window, without re-damaging the brain. We cemented
this windowed cannula to the skull and capped it with Kwik-Cast.
Recording well. During the head-frame surgery, we used the black dental cement to build up a recording well surrounding visual cortex. Finally, we
applied a thin layer of clear cement to the remaining exposed skull to prevent
infection. We sterilized the edges of the skin with povidone-iodine again before
allowing the animals to wake up and administered a single dose of 10% buprenorphrine as a postoperative analgesic. We checked on the mice daily after the
head-frame surgery.
Day of recording. On the day of recording, we anesthetized the mice using
1.8–2% isoflurane, drilled off the clear dental cement covering the recording site,
and made a small craniotomy (diameter approx. 50 µm) over either V1 or visual
thalamus. We covered the animal’s eyes in Artificial Tears lubricant. We fixed the
head-frame to a post, positioned the body of the mouse on the circular treadmill,
and inserted the recording electrode into the brain before allowing the animal
to wake up from anesthesia. Immediately after waking up, the mouse groomed
to remove the lubricant from its eyes. When we recorded in the thalamus both
before and after the animals woke up from anesthesia, we applied only a thin layer
of the relatively transparent eye lubricant to be able to provide visual stimulation
through this protective layer.
Whole-cell recordings in visual cortex under anesthesia. Glass pipettes with tip
resistance of 3–5 MΩ were filled with either cesium-based (in mM: 135 cesium
methanesulfonate, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.3 Na-GTP, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 EGTA, 2 QX314 chloride; pH 7.4 with CsOH, 285–290 mOsm) or potassium-based (in mM:

135 potassium gluconate, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.3 Na-GTP, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 EGTA;
pH 7.4 with KOH, 285–290 mOsm) internal solution and guided to the pial
surface, which was visualized with a microscope using oblique infrared LED
illumination. Recordings were made using the blind whole-cell patch clamp technique56. The depth of the recording was determined using the distance the pipette
traveled from the pial surface as indicated by the micromanipulator reading.
Neurons recorded at 300–550 um depth were considered to be in L4. Neurons
were recorded in the voltage-clamp configuration and held close to the reversal
potential of inhibition at –70 mV to isolate excitatory postsynaptic currents.
Post-mortem histology. Animals were not perfused. We fixed the brains in 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After tissue fixation, we rinsed each brain in PBS overnight, placed the brain into 30% refrigerated sucrose solution for 2 d, and then cryosectioned the tissue using a freezing
microtome. We mounted the 50-µm-thick sections on slides with mounting
medium including DAPI. For V2 track reconstructions, we stained the slices
with blue NeuroTrace (fluorescent Nissl) before mounting. To stain with
NeuroTrace, we rinsed each slice in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min,
washed twice for 5 min in PBS, incubated the slices in 1:200 of NeuroTrace:PBS
for 30 min at room temperature, and washed the slices overnight at 4 °C. When
using the NeuroTrace stain, we did not include DAPI in the mounting medium.
Viral expression (ChR2-TdTomato or ArchT-GFP) and DiI tracks were imaged
on a fluorescent microscope.
Excluding animals with ChR2 expression in V1. All mice with stereotactic injections of AAV2/1.CAGGS.flex.ChR2.tdTomato.SV40 into the TRN were tested
post-mortem for off-target expression of ChR2 in visual cortex. We excluded
all the data from animals showing ChR2 expression of >25% fractional coverage (fraction of pixels presenting any detectable ChR2-TdTomato reporter
fluorescence) in any slice of visual cortex. We verified that <25% fractional
coverage of V1 by ChR2 had no effect on V1 activity during TRN photoactivation (Supplementary Fig. 3). Such off-target expression of ChR2 was
observed in approximately 5–10% of the animals. In addition, when we pointed
an LED-coupled fiber directly at V1 rather than at the TRN, we found that direct
V1 illumination did not affect V1 activity.
Excluding ChR2 expression in dLGN interneurons. In about 20% of the mice,
we observed some ChR2-TdTomato reporter fluorescence in local GABAergic
interneurons of the dLGN. Excluding these mice had no effects on the results
(that is, there was no change in the strength of V1 shut-off or its time course, the
CDF). Furthermore, ChR2 expression in local dLGN interneurons, if anything,
should lead to stronger and faster silencing of the dLGN, not slower and weaker
silencing of dLGN. Therefore, we included all mice in the final figures.
Labeling of electrophysiology recording track. We verified recording sites in the
thalamus and V2 by post-mortem inspection of the electrophysiology recording
tracks. To label a track, at the time of the experiment but after conclusion of the
electrophysiological recordings, we retracted the recording electrode along the
axis of entry, applied a drop of 1 mM DiI to the probe, quickly wicked away
the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) on the surface of the brain, and then
reinserted the recording electrode to the site of data collection. We allowed the
DiI-coated electrode to remain in the brain for at least 10 min before removing
the electrode, sacrificing the animal, and fixing the brain.
Verification of V2 recording sites. After slicing the brain (50-µm sections), we
identified the section containing the fluorescent DiI recording track in lateral
secondary visual cortex (V2L). We identified the boundary between V1 and V2L,
first, by imaging the section in bright-field before mounting the tissue, which
reveals the V1–V2L border as a difference in darkness between the middle layers
of V1 and V2L (likely due to differences between V1 and V2L in the density
of myelinated thalamic afferents terminating in these layers); second, by Nissl
staining and mounting to reveal the dense cytoarchitectonic band of layer 4 in V1;
and, finally, by registering the images from these two methods to each other and
to the Paxinos mouse atlas57. We excluded data obtained from animals in which
the boundary between V1 and V2L58 appeared inconsistent or ambiguous.
Habituating awake mice to the recording set-up. We habituated mice to the
head-fixed electrophysiological set-up before recording in the awake state. Four
or more days after the head-frame surgery, we began a habituation protocol that
exposed a mouse to the recording set-up for 30–60 min each day for at least 3 d.
During each habituation session, the mouse was head-fixed (by fixing the

doi:10.1038/nn.4153

head-frame to a metal post) and allowed to run freely during visual and mock
optogenetic stimulation (LED pulses near the head but pointed away from the
brain). We recorded using the same set-up.
Extracellular electrophysiology. Extracellular recordings from cortex and thalamus were performed using a NeuroNexus silicon probe (A series) with 16 linear
recording sites. In cortex, the 50-µm spacing between these sites provided an
array that spanned 800 µm in total, enabling simultaneous recording from all
cortical layers. In three of our thalamic recording experiments, we instead used
an array with 25-µm spacing to improve unit isolation. The recording electrode
was connected to an AM Systems preamplifying head-stage (20×) through a
Plexon adaptor, and then the voltage signals were further amplified 500× and
filtered between 0.1 Hz and 10 kHz by the AM Systems model 3600 extracellular
amplifier. Data were digitized with a National Instruments Data Acquisition card
and acquired with custom Matlab data acquisition software written by S. Olsen
(University of California San Diego).
V1 recordings. We targeted the center of the monocular zone when
recording from V1.
Recordings in thalamus. We targeted the dLGN by advancing the electrode
straight down at coordinates 1.8 mm posterior and 2 mm lateral to the bregma.
When post-mortem reconstruction of this thalamic recording track revealed
penetration of both dorsal and ventral LGN (in about 10% of the animals), we
included only the topmost visually responsive channels on the recording array to
exclude from the analysis visually responsive units in ventral LGN. We targeted
the lateral posterior nucleus at a site 300–400 µm medial to this dLGN site.
V2 recordings. We stereotactically targeted V2 at >3.25 mm lateral of bregma.
We only included V2L data sets showing an obvious visually evoked response
and for which we were able to confirm by post-mortem histology a recording
site more than 50 µm lateral to a clear V1-V2L border (see “Verification of
V2 recording sites”).

Visual stimulation. We used an LCD computer monitor for visual stimulation (gamma-corrected, mean luminance 50 cd/m2, refresh rate 75 Hz, 16 × 24
inches) at a distance of 25 cm from the eye contralateral to the V1 recording site.
We began the recording with the computer monitor at about a 60-degree angle
from the anterior-posterior axis of the head. We then repositioned the monitor as necessary to place the apparent spatial receptive field of active units on
the center of the screen. The Psychophysics Toolbox in Matlab supported our
presentation of various stimuli. Unless otherwise noted, stimulus contrast was
1, and the mean luminance of each full-contrast stimulus matched that of the
interleaved blank gray screen.
Visual stimuli during V1 extracellular recordings. Visual stimuli consisted of
static gratings (duration: 3 s) of eight interleaved and randomized orientations.
Static gratings (spatial frequency 0.04 cyc/deg) appeared following a gray screen
(6 s inter-trial interval of gray screen) of mean luminance matching the mean
luminance of the static grating. We also used as visual stimuli, as specified in
the text, full-field luminance changes (transition from black to white screen:
duration of white screen, 3 s; duration of inter-trial black screen, 5 s), reversing
checkerboards (one-time contrast reversal of checkerboard pattern, each square
side length 3 degrees, inter-reversal interval 5.5 s), moving gratings (transition
from a gray screen to a pattern of black and white oriented bars, eight interleaved
and randomized orientations, moving across the screen at a constant speed:
spatial frequency, 0.04 cyc/deg; temporal frequency, 2 to 3 cyc/s) and full-field
flashes of white or blue light lasting between 10 and 100 ms.
Visual stimuli during V1 whole-cell recordings. Visual stimuli consisted of static
gratings (as above; duration either 250 ms or 1.7 s) at the cell’s preferred orientation (spatial frequency 0.04 cyc/deg) or a full-field luminance step lasting 1.7 s
(n = 4 cells). A given stimulus was presented at least four times and stimulus order
was randomized. LED and non-LED blocks were interleaved.
Visual stimulation to measure the frequency response. We used the light of a blue
light-emitting diode (LED) collimated through an objective lens (5×, 0.15 NA).
The back aperture of this objective was pointed at the eye of the mouse to obtain
a spatially unstructured, illuminated circular field at the eye (diameter ~3 cm
at eye). The LED light source allowed us to produce precisely time-varying
visual stimuli (frequencies between 1 and 60 Hz, or logarithmically modulated
frequency sweeps, called chirps), uniformly illuminating much of the visual
field of the eye contralateral to the recording site. We modulated the LED with a
computer-generated voltage signal. The power output of the LED varied sinusoidally between 0 and 25 mW (3.5 mW/cm2) as the input signal varied in time.
Visual stimulation to measure the depression of thalamo-cortical synapses.
We used the same LED visual stimulation set-up described above (see “Visual
stimulation to measure the frequency response”) to present pulse trains of brief
(10 ms duration, 3.5 mW/cm2) flashes to the contralateral eye. The frequency of
the pulse train varied between 1 and 60 Hz.
Photo-activation of TRN. LED: LEDP-B_PF960-0.50-1m-FC_R2 from
Doric Lenses, 470 nm. Laser: Omicron, 80 mW maximum output, 470 nm.
Anesthetized animals. The optical fiber coupled to a blue LED (1 mm diameter;
maximum power output 80 mW) was inserted and targeted as described above

nature NEUROSCIENCE

(“Animal surgery”). We were able to use <10-mW step functions to drive maximal
silencing of the dLGN in most mice, but in some animals we increased the power
output of the LED to achieve maximal thalamic silencing. In some experiments,
we used various LED intensities below 10 mW to partially silence thalamus.
In anesthetized animals, in the presence of continuous TRN illumination, dLGN
silencing lasted for more than 1 s.
The ability of LED illumination to drive sustained spiking of the TRN units
wore off over the course of about 1–2 h of recording under anesthesia when we
frequently photo-activated the TRN (LED on for 1 s every 7 s). (We recorded
the TRN population activity as LED-driven axonal signals in the dLGN—see
below, “Sorting single units”.) Less frequent TRN photo-activation eliminated this
run-down effect (LED on for <0.5 s every 10 s). This run-down was independent of anesthetic depth and time from penetration of the electrode. Thus, it was
a function of illumination frequency and not of brain state or tissue recovery.
For strong, reliable and sustained TRN photo-activation leading to strong
thalamic silencing, we increased the inter-trial interval to eliminate this
run-down effect and chose to include only data from the first hour of each
anesthetized recording session.
Awake animals. We inserted an optical fiber (diameter 200 µm) coupled to a
blue laser (power output 10 mW for photo-activation) into a cannula chronically
implanted above the TRN, as described above (“Animal surgery”). In contrast to
what was observed in anesthetized animals (see above), continuous illumination
of the TRN in awake animals provided sustained silencing of the dLGN for only
about 250 ms. In fact, dLGN silencing in awake animals was invariably followed
by a rebound of activity (recorded in both dLGN and V1) approximately 250 ms
after laser onset, although the laser remained on. This rebound was the first
cycle of a thalamo-cortical oscillation (4–8 Hz) lasting for a second or more.
Thus, in awake mice, we only considered the thalamus to be silenced during the
first 125 ms immediately following TRN photo-activation. Given the ~10-ms
CDF, this 125-ms time window is more than long enough for a complete
characterization of the time course of V1 shut-off following TRN photostimulation in awake mice.
Photo-activation of cortical interneurons to silence V1 recurrent excitatory
circuits. A blue LED (455 nm) coupled to a 1-mm fiber was positioned several
millimeters above the pial surface. Total power from the fiber was 25 mW. In LED
blocks, the LED was turned on 645 ms before the onset of each block of visual
stimulus and lasted the duration of the stimulus block.
Photo-activation of ArchT in V1 inhibitory interneurons. We used an amber
LED (1 mm diameter, approximately 10–30 mW output; see explanation below)
positioned above visual cortex to photo-activate ArchT expressed in cortical
inhibitory interneurons (see section on viral injections, above). We titrated the
intensity of the amber LED to maximally disinhibit the visually evoked response
without triggering ictal events. We performed this experiment in anesthetized
mice because even slight disinhibition of the visual cortex in awake animals triggered ictal-like activity. To determine the CDF, we presented a visual stimulus
(full-field moving grating, orientation varied at random) and silenced relay thalamus by activating the TRN with a blue LED (see above). We used four interleaved
LED conditions: (1) No LED, (2) Blue LED, (3) Amber LED and (4) Amber plus
Blue LED. These LED conditions were presented in the order “1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4”
to verify that any observed change in the CDF was not affected by the LED condition on the previous trial. The effect of the amber LED on the CDF was consistent over the course of the V1 recording. We observed the greatest slowing of
the CDF in mice showing widespread expression of ArchT across visual cortex.
We quantified the spread of ArchT expression as the ‘fractional coverage’ of V1:
that is, the fraction of V1 pixels presenting any detectable ArchT-GFP reporter
fluorescence in post-mortem sections. We selected the five mice with the greatest
ArchT fractional coverage of V1 for Figure 5. When we included all the experiments in which we illuminated ArchT in V1, irrespective of fractional coverage
(n = 19 mice), suppression of inhibitory interneurons still produced a significant
slowing of the cortical CDF (Supplementary Fig. 9). We recorded in V1 for an
hour before moving the electrode to the dLGN of the same mouse to verify no
change in shut-off in the dLGN.
Data analysis: whole-cell (Fig. 1b). The responses to repeated presentations of
the stimulus were averaged, and the average value in a baseline window spanning

the time window from the onset of the stimulus to 25 ms after stimulus onset
was subtracted from control (non-LED) and LED conditions for each cell. All
traces were shifted in time such that the onset of the visual response in the LED
condition occurred at time 0. Onset was defined as the time point at which the
response grew to beyond 3 s.d. of the baseline. Excitatory postsynaptic currents
(EPSCs) during control (non-LED) and LED conditions were normalized across
cells by normalizing each cell’s LED and non-LED trace to the peak amplitude
of the non-LED response (Fig. 1b, middle row). Peak amplitude was determined from traces that were down-sampled with 5-ms binning. The population
averages of non-LED and LED responses were calculated by averaging
responses across all cells.
Quantifying the fraction of response mediated by recurrent cortical circuits. To
determine the fraction of the response dependent on cortical recurrent circuits
(Fig. 1b, bottom row), responses were processed as above but were not normalized. The responses were binned into 5-ms windows, and the LED response was
shifted so that the first bin (0–5 ms) was equal to that of the non-LED response.
For each cell, we calculated the difference between the non-LED (black) and
LED (blue) traces, and then divided this quantity by the non-LED (black) trace
at each time point. For cells in which the longer, 1.7-s-duration stimulation was
employed, this calculation was performed only up to the time point at which the
non-LED response was greater than 10% of its peak amplitude.
Data analysis: single-unit response durations (Fig. 1c). To measure the
response duration for each single unit individually, we plotted the trialaveraged peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) of the unit’s response and then
measured the time it took for this PSTH to re-enter the noise (that is, when
the unit’s firing rate after the stimulus returned to within 1 s.d. of the mean
of the unit’s activity in the absence of a visual stimulus). We report this time
as the response duration.

and anatomically defined Cre+ neuronal population). We found that the depth
relationship was consistent across awake and anesthetized mice, thus validating
the utility of the CSD-defined L4 sink as an alignment point. Finally, we assigned
putative cortical layers (notably, these are only rough estimates of the cortical layer
boundaries) to the aligned average by stretching a template of putative cortical
layer widths from slice experiments (quantification by D. Bortone, University of
California San Diego) across the depth of cortex, with L4 at the L4 CSD sink.
Data analysis: V1 active states under anesthesia. We identified V1 active states
according to the local field potential (LFP) power ratio (PR), a method that
quantifies the ratio of the power in the LFP between 5 and 30 Hz over power
between 30 and 100 Hz. Increases in this LFP PR, as calculated from single-trial
spectrograms (Gabor-Morlet wavelets, as in ref. 61 or Chronux62) are indicative
of Up states (cortical active states under anesthesia). We found a threshold for the
PR able to separate Up (high activity) and Down (low activity) states by plotting
the bimodal distribution of cortical multi-unit (MU) firing rates across 500 ms
time bins, using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify
the MU threshold best separating the two modes in this histogram (Up and
Down states), and then converting this MU threshold to a PR threshold using
the least-squares linear fit to the relationship between MU firing rate and PR.
Thus, consistent with the identification of Up states in previous work, we selected
time periods of cortical activity characterized by a high LFP PR. We applied this
LFP PR threshold to all the cortical LFP data to pick out the Up states beginning
within 300 ms of silencing of the thalamus, aligned the Up states to their onsets
and to the LED onset, and calculated the average firing rate over the course of
the Up state (Fig. 2e).

Data analysis: sorting single units. We used UltraMegaSort from D.N. Hill, S.B.
Mehta and D. Kleinfeld59 to cluster spike waveforms into putative units and then
manual sorting to verify the quality of the isolated units. Our units were wellisolated clusters with large spikes (Gaussian fit to the distribution of spike amplitudes suggested >85% of the spikes in every cluster were greater than 4 × the s.d. of
the high-frequency noise), contained fewer refractory period violations than 1%
of the total spikes, and did not appear similar in waveform shape or amplitude to
any neighboring clusters, thus excluding units that could be confused.
Sorting thalamic relay units. We separated the signals obtained from our dLGN
recordings into spikes originating from putative relay cells and spikes originating
from putative TRN axons. Spikes from putative relay cells had larger, broader
waveforms and exhibited significantly higher F1 modulation. Furthermore, these
spikes were suppressed by TRN photo-activation, and they showed a clear postinhibitory rebound. Activity from the putative TRN axons, in contrast, represented
a very thin, low-amplitude spike population (hash). The spike rate of this hash
was increased by TRN photo-stimulation with very low latency. Thus, we separated the spikes of the putative relay cells from the LED-driven hash by isolating
single units and then excluding any units with an average spike waveform width
at half-maximum of less than 0.22 ms.
Separating regular-spiking and fast-spiking units in the cortex. We separated the
regular-spiking (putative excitatory) and fast-spiking (putative inhibitory) units in
the cortex by evaluating the average waveform of each unit by eye. The mean width
at half-maximum of the spike waveform for regular-spiking units was 0.44 ms
(s.d. 0.16 ms). The mean width at half-maximum of the spike waveform for
fast-spiking units was 0.25 ms (s.d. 0.067 ms).

Data analysis: PSTH normalization. dLGN PSTH under anesthesia. To show
the effects of TRN photo-activation on thalamic relay cell activity (Fig. 2c), we
isolated putative relay cells as described above (“Sorting thalamic relay units”)
and plotted, for each mouse, a PSTH of summed single-unit activity, analogous to
multi-unit activity but excluding high-frequency noise and putative axonal hash
(see above). We then normalized the PSTH for each mouse by the mean summed
single-unit activity over the full duration of the moving grating (3 s) during
control conditions (black). Error bars are s.d. of the normalized PSTH across mice.
Summed single-unit activity in the thalamus was not baseline-subtracted.
V1 PSTH under anesthesia. For visually evoked activity in V1 (Fig. 2f), we
show the baseline-subtracted multi-unit PSTH in response to brief visual stimuli,
normalized by the mean multi-unit firing rate over the first 500 ms of the
control evoked response. This PSTH includes responses to brief flashes, reversing
checkerboards, full-field luminance transitions and static gratings. The results
were the same for all these brief stimuli and also for moving gratings. We show
the cortical decay function (CDF) during brief stimuli in Figure 2f. Again, there
was no difference in the CDF between brief visual stimuli and moving gratings
(Supplementary Table 1). The PSTH showing spontaneous activity in V1 during
Up states (Fig. 2e) is multi-unit activity normalized by the mean firing rate in the
control condition over the 500-ms window surrounding the peak of the Up state,
similar to the PSTH showing visually evoked activity. In all cases, error bars are
s.d. of the normalized PSTH across mice.
Awake. We also show the visually evoked PSTH in awake mice (Fig. 3b). In
this case, we show the PSTH for visual stimuli including moving gratings and the
CDF curves separately for brief visual stimuli (brief flashes, reversing checkerboards, full-field luminance transitions and static gratings) and moving gratings.
As under anesthesia, there was no change in the CDF across any of the visual
stimuli tested (Supplementary Table 1).

Registration of recording depth by current source density and alignment
relative to Scnn1a-Tg3 Cre mouse line. To correct for potential variation in
the position of the 16 linear electrode channels relative to cortical layers across
experiments, we used the current source density (CSD) to identify the site of the
L4 current sink at stimulus onset and used this site as a reference. We verified
the stability of this CSD-defined L4 sink relative to the cortical anatomy using
conditional expression of virally injected ChR2 in the Scnn1a-Tg3-Cre mouse
line, which expresses Cre recombinase mainly in L4 excitatory neurons60.
We first measured the CSD-defined L4 sink at stimulus onset and then photostimulated the ChR2-expressing L4 population on interleaved trials to determine
the relationship between these two reference points (functionally defined L4 sink

Data analysis: accounting for shut-off delay in dLGN. To calculate the exact
time course of sensory activity decay intrinsic to the cortical recurrent circuits
(in linear systems terms, the cortical impulse response function), we needed to
remove (deconvolve) the time course of shut-off in the thalamus from the time
course of shut-off in the cortex. However, deconvolution of real neural signals
with noise introduces error. Therefore we decided to study the shape of the decay
curve in V1 only after the thalamus was nearly off. The single exponential time
constant fit to the shut-off of activity in dLGN was 3.7 ms. Thus, the dLGN
activity has already decreased substantially (>60%) by about 3 ms after the LED
onset. Furthermore, 3 ms is the average delay before activity begins to obviously decay in V1. Beyond 3 ms, a single exponential fit well approximated the

result of the deconvolution (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Furthermore, the V1 decay
time course approximated an exponential function, and an exponential function
has the same shape at all scales, meaning that theoretically we can measure any
window of the exponential decay and get the same fit. Finally, considering this
time window beyond 3 ms after LED onset is more than sufficient to allow us to
study response frequencies between 1 and 60 Hz. For these reasons, in all cases,
we fit the single exponential decay to cortical shut-off starting 3 ms after LED
onset. This accounts for the time it takes the dLGN to shut off.
Data analysis: single exponential fits to cortical shut-off. We applied the
following protocol to fit the CDF. (i) We used the baseline-subtracted PSTH
of V1 shut-off between 3 and 50 ms after the onset of the LED (or longer; see
time window in each figure). The 3-ms delay from LED onset was excluded
from the shut-off curve to account for the time it takes the dLGN to shut off
(see section above). (ii) Avoiding any assumptions about the expected fractional
suppression of the evoked response, we used Matlab to fit a single exponential
plus a constant offset to this PSTH. This method optimized the fit to all points
in the trace, without forcing the initial or final values. (iii) If this method failed
to return a fit, we forced the constant offset to equal the mean value of the last
5 ms of the shut-off PSTH. (iv) In the case of noisy data, this latter method
could also fail to return a fit, in which case we forced both the initial value of
the exponential fit to equal the mean of the PSTH over the 20 ms preceding
the LED onset and the final value of the exponential fit to zero. (v) If all of
these methods failed to fit the shut-off curve, we excluded the data. (vi) All fits
were verified by eye.
Data analysis: frequency response. Frequency response: heat map. To compare
the responses of dLGN and V1 to high-contrast, sinusoidally modulated,
full-field luminance stimuli (called flicker stimuli) presented at various temporal frequencies (15 stimulus frequencies between 1 and 60 Hz), we used the
frequency response. We computed the frequency response as follows.
We used Chronux62 to compute the amplitude spectrum (or power spectrum)
of the trial-averaged steady-state PSTH (between 0.4 and 2 s after stimulus onset)
in response to each stimulus frequency. With this method, we picked out the
frequency component of the response to a given stimulus as long as that component was phase-locked to the onset of the stimulus (that is, apparent in the trialaveraged PSTH). We created heat-map matrices of the power at each frequency
to summarize the neural responses in dLGN and V1 as a function of stimulus
frequency (Supplementary Fig. 8b). When combining single units, each single
unit’s heat map was first normalized to its peak along the diagonal, to equally
weight all units in the combined heat map and thus avoid a larger contribution from cells with higher firing rates. We also excluded units that were not
visually responsive. For dLGN, we show the median rather than the mean heat
map and frequency response to reduce biases from very high firing rate outlier
units observed in dLGN (about 3% of total units). For V1, we show the mean
(in Fig. 4c,f,g) and the median (in Supplementary Fig. 5b). For V1 units, the
mean and median are very similar. However, we also show the full distributions
for dLGN and V1 amplitudes as percentiles in Supplementary Figure 5b to show
that the full distributions are consistent with filtering by the CDF.
Frequency response: two-dimensional plot. To obtain a simple two-dimensional
plot that captures how well the dLGN and V1 followed the stimulus input
frequencies (Fig. 4c,f,g), we plotted the amplitude of the neural response at
each frequency of the stimulus (Fig. 4c,f,g). To obtain a meaningful zero value
for this two-dimensional plot, we subtracted the average amplitude of the nonspecific response at all response frequencies above 70 Hz. This ‘nonspecific
response’ was equivalent to the amplitude at frequencies other than the frequency
of the input, when we did not observe harmonics. In the power heat maps, for
example, the nonspecific power corresponds to the dark blue background. This
nonspecific response subtraction eliminates noise contributions to the final
frequency response.
Frequency response: prediction in the time domain. We predicted the V1 PSTH
(Fig. 4b, pink traces) by convolving the dLGN PSTH traces (Fig. 4b, top) with the
regular-spiking empirical CDF of V1 measured during moving gratings (Fig. 4c,
inset, and Supplementary Figs. 2g and 7, pink). The CDF did not change with
stimulus type for all stimulus types tested, so we chose this very clean measurement of the regular-spiking units’ CDF to attempt to predict the regular-spiking

units’ frequency response in V1. For the example data in Figure 4b, to maintain
the relative amplitudes of the predicted responses across temporal frequencies
of the visual stimulus, we scaled all the pink traces by the same amount to best
match, by eye, the actual V1 PSTH responses (black traces). We then aligned each
pink trace to each black trace by eye. The pink prediction curves in Figure 4b
for 4 and 6 Hz visual stimuli in the awake mouse have been flipped upside
down with respect to the curve in dLGN to account for the fact that, in this
example, units sampled in V1 in response to these stimulus temporal frequencies have a 90-degree phase offset with respect to the units sampled in dLGN.
This does not affect the ability of the CDF to predict the amplitude of the V1
response (Fig. 4b). Sometimes our recordings sampled more On-responsive
units; other times our recordings sampled more Off-responsive units. Therefore
we focused on testing the ability of the CDF to predict V1’s multi-unit response
amplitude, not its phase.
Prediction in the frequency domain. We predicted V1’s frequency response
by multiplying the dLGN’s frequency response (Fig. 4c, green) by the amplitude spectrum of the CDF (Supplementary Fig. 7b, pink). For the summary
two-dimensional single-line graphs (Fig. 4c), we plotted the cortical prediction
(pink) relative to the thalamic frequency response (green) such that an ideal
frequency response curve representing ‘perfect following’ of the thalamic input
(that is, filtered by an infinitesimally fast CDF) would lie atop the plotted thalamic
response. Because the proportionality factor relating firing rates in the dLGN to
firing rates in V1 is not known, the absolute amplitude of the actual V1 frequency
response (black) relative to the predicted V1 frequency response (pink) is arbitrary. Thus, in Figure 4 we aligned the prediction for V1 (pink) to V1’s actual
frequency response (black) by scaling the heights of the curves to minimize the
difference between the curves by eye, while also aligning these curves at the
nonspecific, baseline-subtracted zero (see “Frequency response: 2D plot” above
for explanation of zero in the frequency response). In Figure 4g, we use the same
method to predict the frequency response curve that would result from replacing
the real CDF with a time constant of 1 ms or 100 ms.
Models of fundamental (F1) and first harmonic (F2) responses in V1
(Supplementary Fig. 8). To test whether a simple transformation of spatial
receptive field (SRF) structures between dLGN and V1 could account for the
decrease in V1 response amplitudes to high temporal frequencies with respect
to the response in dLGN, we considered an alternate simple model: responses at
the fundamental (F1) in dLGN can become responses at the first harmonic (F2)
in V1. We found that this model alone, in the absence of low-pass filtering by the
cortical decay function (CDF), was not able to account for the observed F1 and
F2 responses in V1 (Supplementary Fig. 8).
First, we measured the fundamental (response frequency matches stimulus
frequency, called F1 modulation) and first harmonic (response frequency is
twice the stimulus frequency, called F2 modulation) amplitudes in dLGN and
V1 (Supplementary Fig. 8b,c). We then attempted to fit three models, inspired
by previous work on spatial receptive fields in the visual system2 (Supplementary
Fig. 8d), to this data.
Model 1. Model 1 allows F1 activity in dLGN to drive F1 activity in V1. F2
activity is not considered. Model 1 is the simple model presented in Figure 4.
For discussion of model 1 and filtering of the F1 response by the cortical decay
function (CDF), see above.
Model 2A. Model 2A allows F1 activity in dLGN to drive either F1 or F2 activity
in V1. F2 activity in dLGN can also drive F2 activity in V1. In this model, there
is no filtering by the cortical decay function (CDF).
Model 2B. Model 2B allows the same F1-to-F2 transformations as model 2A
but also includes filtering by the CDF.
Equations for models of F1 and F2 responses in dLGN and V1. Let dF1(f) be the
amplitude of dLGN’s F1 response as a function of the visual stimulus temporal
frequency f. Let dF2(f) be the amplitude of dLGN’s F2 response as a function of
stimulus frequency. Similarly, let VF1(f) and VF2(f) be the amplitudes of V1’s F1
and F2 responses, respectively, as functions of stimulus frequency. Let c0 be a constant scaling factor between dLGN spiking and V1 spiking that is independent of
stimulus frequency. Let FNTC(fresp) be the amplitude scaling produced by filtering
thalamic activity at frequency fresp with the CDF. Finally, let D(f) be the fraction
of the F1 amplitude in the dLGN at stimulus frequency f that is transformed to
an F2 response in V1, without a loss of amplitude during this transformation.
This is the simplest model of an F1-to-F2 transformation between dLGN and V1.

doi:10.1038/nn.4153

Let D(f) vary as a function of stimulus frequency. Then we can write models 2A
and 2B as two systems of equations:
Model 2A: no filtering by CDF:
VF1 ( f ) = c0 (1 − D ( f )) dF1 ( f )
VF2 ( f ) = c0 (dF2 ( f ) + D ( f ) dF1 ( f ))
Model 2B: includes filtering by CDF:
VF1 ( f ) = c0 FNTC ( f ) (1 − D ( f )) dF1 ( f )

© 2015 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

VF2 ( f ) = c0 FNTC (2 f ) (dF2 ( f ) + D ( f ) dF1 ( f ))
To test models 2A and 2B, we solved each system of equations above for the
fraction of the F1 response in dLGN that is frequency-doubled to produce F2 in
V1 (a parameter we call D(f); see above). We took the average estimate of D(f)
from each equation, forcing D(f) ≥ 0 (Supplementary Fig. 8e). We then used this
estimate of D(f) to predict the F1 and F2 amplitudes for V1 and compared these
predictions to the real F1 and F2 responses in V1 (Supplementary Fig. 8f). If
a simple solution exists to model 2A or 2B, we should be able to find a value of
D(f) that accurately predicts both V1’s F1 response and V1’s F2 response. We were
only able to find such a value for D(f) in the context of model 2B, which includes
filtering by the CDF, indicating the following: first, model 2A does not explain
V1’s response, and, second, V1’s F1 and F2 responses are better explained by
filtering with the CDF than by a simple, lossless (no loss of amplitude) F1-to-F2
transformation between dLGN and V1.
Data analysis: deconvolution of dLGN PSTH from V1 PSTH. In Supplementary
Figure 5c, we approximate the temporal transformation of the sensory response
between dLGN and V1 directly by computing the deconvolution of the dLGN
response from the V1 response. We used Matlab to compute this deconvolution for each pair of responses in dLGN and V1 to the same visual stimulus
(same temporal frequency of the flicker stimulus), across all possible pairs of
recordings across all mice. We then computed the average and standard error
of this deconvolution across all the pairwise dLGN-V1 comparisons. The result
of the deconvolution is noisy because the deconvolution of real neural signals
is not ideal (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Therefore, this deconvolution should be
viewed as a rough approximation. To summarize the difference in this result
between anesthesia and awake, we fit a single exponential decay function to each
deconvolution (black fits in Supplementary Fig. 5c).
Measuring thalamo-cortical synaptic depression in vivo. We isolated the
thalamic component of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSPthal)
recorded in layer 4 as described in detail previously21. Briefly, we optogenetically silenced visual cortex by photo-activating GABAergic cortical interneurons conditionally expressing ChR2 (in Gad2-Cre mice with viral injections—see
above—or in vGat-ChR2 reporter mice) with a blue LED positioned above visual
cortex while recording the fEPSPthal with a 16-channel linear extracellular array
(NeuroNexus, A series). Visual stimuli consisted of brief pulse trains of blue
light flashed at the contralateral eye ranging in frequency between 1 and 60 Hz
(see “Visual stimulation to measure the depression of thalamo-cortical synapses”).
To separate the depression occurring at the thalamo-cortical synapse63,64 from
any potential frequency-dependent changes occurring upstream of the dLGN-V1
synapse (for example, adaptation of the spike rate response in the dLGN), we also
measured the spike rate response in the dLGN to the same visual pulse trains and
normalized the fEPSPthal in V1 at each response number by the amplitude of that
response in the dLGN multi-unit response. We also plotted the raw steady-state
amplitude of the fEPSPthal response to the visual stimulus pulse train (Fig. 4e,f;

doi:10.1038/nn.4153

see “Visual stimulation to measure the depression of thalamo-cortical synapses”),
comparing anesthetized and awake recordings.
Data analysis: predicting slowed cortical onset response when CDF is slowed.
In Supplementary Figure 10e, we predict the change in the cortical response to
the onset of a visual stimulus (moving grating) when the CDF is slowed by suppressing cortical inhibitory interneurons. To do this, we first consider the onset of
the sensory-evoked response in V1 (blue line in Supplementary Fig. 10e marked
“Control”) to be the combination (convolution) of the time course of the response
in the thalamus with the CDF under control conditions. Then we can ask: how
does changing the CDF without changing the time course of response in the
thalamus change the time course of response in the cortex? To analyze this, we
first deconvolve the CDF under control conditions from the onset response in V1
under control conditions to arrive at the approximate onset response in the dLGN.
Then we recombine (convolve) this onset response in the dLGN with the slower
CDF under conditions of reduced cortical inhibition (dark purple line in Fig. 5d)
to predict V1’s onset response under conditions of reduced cortical inhibition.
This convolution gives the prediction (lighter purple line in Supplementary
Fig. 10e ii, marked “Prediction for disinhibition”). This prediction matches the
actual time course (darker purple line in Supplementary Fig. 10e ii, marked
“V1 disinh.”) of the V1 response to the onset of the visual stimulus under conditions of reduced cortical inhibition. We then plot how the onset response is
slowed by V1 disinhibition as the time delay between the blue and dark purple
onset curves. If these curves are the same and not shifted in time, the time delay
should be centered around 0. However, we see that the time delay is centered at a
few milliseconds lag, consistent with the prediction by the CDF.
Statistics. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our
sample sizes are similar to those generally employed in the field. Data collection
and analyses were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiment.

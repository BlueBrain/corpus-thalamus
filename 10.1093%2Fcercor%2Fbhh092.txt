A major challenge in the post-genomic era is to determine the
relevance of specific gene expression patterns on behavior.
Neurons, the building blocks of the nervous system, display a
variety of complex electrical behaviors that result from the
orchestrated activity of a large number of different ion channels (reviewed in, for example, Johnston and Wu, 1995;
Sakmann and Neher, 1995; Hille, 2001). However, it is very
difficult to quantify the causal relationship between the expression of specific genes and the electrical function of the neuron
because there are numerous complex non-linear steps between
genome, proteome, and electrical phenotype. These include
the amounts of mRNA transcribed, the amounts of protein
translated from the mRNAs, post-translational modifications,
heteromerization of ion channel subunits, ion channel modulation by auxiliary subunits, different protein turnover rates and
targeting via different anchoring proteins. Furthermore, the
electrical phenotype also depends on where the active channel
is localized on the neuron and on the specific morphology of
the neuron.
Only a few studies have established strong evidence for a
causal relationship between the expression of a single ion
channel gene and the electrical behavior using, for example,

dynamic clamp in hippocampal neurons (Lien and Jonas,
2003), antisense oligonucleotides in hippocampal neurons (Du
et al., 2000), transfection with dominant negative mutants in
cerebellar granule cells (Shibata et al., 2000), single-cell
pharmacology and transfection of HEK cells (Baranauskas et
al., 2003) and modeling combined with immunohistochemical
and pharmacological approaches in neocortical interneurons
(Erisir et al., 1999).
More commonly, attempts have been made to correlate the
frequency of detecting an expressed gene in a specific cell
with an electrophysiological feature (Yan and Surmeier, 1996;
Martina et al., 1998; Plant et al., 1998; Song et al., 1998; Lien et
al., 2002). In some cases it has been possible to establish a
correlation between the expression of specific ion channel
subunits and an aspect of electrical behavior (Martina et al.,
1998; Plant et al., 1998; Seifert et al., 1999; Liss et al., 2001;
Lien et al., 2002). However, causal relationships have often
been much more difficult to establish. This difficulty probably
results from the enormous complexity. Since a large number of
ion channel genes may be expressed in different combinations
to generate the electrical behavior, a first essential step is to
establish quantitatively the degree to which profiles of
expressed genes are correlated to the electrical behavior.
Although there are several published reports of the simultaneous expression of a large number of receptors using singleneuronal RT-PCR (Porter et al., 1998; Cauli et al., 2000), a
maximum of only five ion channel genes were simultaneously
investigated. Mermelstein et al. (1999) studied the expression
of Caα1A and its four auxiliary subunits Caβ1–4 from acutely
dissociated cortical pyramidal neurons; Franz et al. (2000)
studied the co-expression of the four Na+/K + channels HCN1–4
in layer V pyramidal neurons; and Foehring et al. (2000)
reported the expression of Caα1E from acutely dissociated
neocortical pyramidal neurons.
The detection of specific mRNA transcripts from a single cell
is a technical challenge due to the minute quantities of mRNA
in a single neuron. There are several strategies to overcome
this limitation. The most straightforward strategy is to use the
entire cell’s cytoplasm to test the expression of a single gene
(Martina et al., 1998). A second strategy is to split the cell’s
cytoplasm into as many reactions as genes to be tested before
amplifying each gene independently (Surmeier et al., 1996;
Yan and Surmeier, 1996). A third strategy, useful when the
genes of interest show a high degree of sequence similarity, is
to design a single pair of degenerated primers located in
regions identical or nearly identical for all the genes (Plant et
al., 1998; Lien et al., 2002). Subsequently, the identity of each
gene can be determined by: (i) differences in the size of the

The computational power of the neocortex arises from interactions
of multiple neurons, which display a wide range of electrical properties. The gene expression profiles underlying this phenotypic diversity are unknown. To explore this relationship, we combined wholecell electrical recordings with single-cell multiplex RT-PCR of rat
(p13–16) neocortical neurons to obtain cDNA libraries of 26 ion channels (including voltage activated potassium channels, Kv1.1/2/4/6,
Kvβ1/2, Kv2.1/2, Kv3.1/2/3/4, Kv4.2/3; sodium/potassium permeable
hyperpolarization activated channels, HCN1/2/3/4; the calcium activated potassium channel, SK2; voltage activated calcium channels,
Caα1A/B/G/I, Caβ1/3/4), three calcium binding proteins (calbindin,
parvalbumin and calretinin) and GAPDH. We found a previously
unreported clustering of ion channel genes around the three calciumbinding proteins. We further determined that cells similar in their
expression patterns were also similar in their electrical properties.
Subsequent regression modeling with statistical resampling yielded
a set of coefficients that reliably predicted electrical properties from
the expression profile of individual neurons. This is the first report of
a consistent relationship between the co-expression of a large profile
of ion channel and calcium binding protein genes and the electrical
phenotype of individual neocortical neurons.

Materials and Methods
Slice Preparation
Slicing procedure was described previously (Gupta et al., 2000;
Markram et al., 1997). In brief, Wistar rats (13–16 days old) were
rapidly decapitated and neocortical slices (sagittal, 300 µm thick)
were sectioned on a vibratome (Microslicer; DSK, Japan). Slices were
incubated for 30 min at 34°C and then at room temperature until
transferred to the recording chamber. The extra-cellular solution
contained (mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 glucose, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25
NaH2PO 4, 2 CaCl2 and 1 MgCl 2. Neurons in somatosensory cortex
were visually identified using infrared differential interference
contrast microscopy.

Electrical Recording
This was performed as previously described (Markram et al., 1997;
Gupta et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2002). In brief, somatic whole-cell
recordings (pipette resistance 1–3 MΩ) were made. Signals were
sampled at intervals of 10–400 µs, filtered at 3, 10 or 30 kHz, digitized
using an ITC-18 interface (Instrutech, Great Neck, NY) and stored on
the computer hard disk for off-line analysis (Igor Wavemetrics, Lake
Oswego, OR). Voltages were recorded with pipettes containing
RNAse-free (mM) 100 K+ gluconate, 20 KCl, 4 ATP–Mg, 10 phosphocreatine, 0.3 GTP, 10 Hepes (pH 7.3, 310 mosmol/l, adjusted with
sucrose) and 0.5% biocytin (Sigma). Neurons were filled with biocytin
by diffusion during the 20–30 min recordings. Strengths of current
injection were normalized across all cells according to the minimal
step current required to reach AP threshold. Somatic current injections to reach threshold ranged from 30 to 150 pA.
Analysis of Electrophysiological Recordings
Intrinsic properties: input resistances were approximated by linear
regression of voltage deflections from holding potential (–70 ± 1 mV)
in response to 2 s current steps of four to eight different amplitudes
after reaching steady state. Membrane time constants were determined by fitting a mono-exponential to the decay phases of hyperpolarizing delta-pulses (1 ms duration, voltage deflections of <10 mV),
or from fitting a mono-exponential to the rising phases of the voltage
traces used for determining the input resistances. AP analysis was
performed on the first and second APs elicited by supra-threshold
depolarizations. Values of the AP amplitude, duration, half duration
(time from AP half amplitude to the same voltage during offset), rise
time and fall time (duration from peak to the offset — when Vm
reaches that of onset) were determined by averaging three to five
values. Values of the fAHP were determined by averaging three to five
traces. Maximum rise and fall rates were obtained as peak values after
differentiating the single AP.
Histological Procedures and Morphological Identification
These were performed as previously described in (Markram et al.,
1997; Gupta et al., 2000). In brief, after recording, slices were fixed
for 24 h in cold 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4) containing 2%
paraformaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde and 0.3% saturated picric acid,
then rinsed several times in PB and transferred into phosphatebuffered 3% H2O 2 for 30 min. After rinsing in PB, slices were incubated overnight at 4°C in biotinylated horseradish peroxidase conjugated to avidin (2% A, 2% B and 1% Triton-100, ABC-Elite; Vector Labs,
Peterborough, UK). Sections were then washed several times in PB,
developed with diaminobenzadine, washed and then mounted. Subsequently neurons were morphologically classified according to the
axonal morphology (reviewed in, for example, Toledo-Rodriguez et
al., 2002).
Cytoplasm Harvesting and Single-Cell Reverse Transcription
These procedures were performed as previously described (Cauli et
al., 1997; Wang et al., 2002). In brief, at the end of the recording, cell
cytoplasm was aspirated into the recording pipette under visual
control by applying gentle negative pressure. Only cells in which the
seal was intact throughout the recording and whose nucleus was not
harvested were further processed. The electrode was then withdrawn
from the cell to form an outside-out patch that prevented contamination as the pipette was removed. The tip of the pipette was broken
and the contents of the pipette expelled into a test tube by applying
positive pressure. mRNA was reverse transcribed using an oligo-dT
primer (25 ng/ul) and 100 U of MMLV reverse transcriptase (Gibco,
BRL). After 50 min incubation at 42°C, the cDNA was frozen and
stored at –20°C before further processing.
Multiplex PCR
Multiplex-PCR conditions were optimized using total RNA purified
from rat neocortex, so that a PCR product could be detected from
(250 pg–1 ng) of total RNA without contamination caused by nonspecific amplification. For the lists of the primer pairs included into
the different multiplexes, the name and accession number of the
genes amplified and the length of the PCR product, see Table 1. Three
different multiplex-PCR reactions were performed for testing the

PCR products; (ii) use of specific restriction enzymes that cut
only one amplified PCR product (Plant et al., 1998); (iii)
Southern blot using gene specific probes (Lien et al., 2002); or
(iv) second PCR using gene specific nested primers (Lien et al.,
2002). A fourth method is non-specific pre-amplification of all
the neuron’s mRNA before the gene specific PCR, using amplification methods based on either PCR (Brady et al., 1990; Dulac
and Axel, 1995; Dixon et al., 1998; Lin et al., 1999) or T7
mRNA polymerase (Eberwine et al., 1992; Ginsberg and Che,
2002). Although T7 mRNA amplification is routine when
starting from micrograms of mRNA or cDNA, it remains technically challenging when starting from the picogram-levels of
mRNA, available from single neurons. Although a few studies
attempted cDNA microarray analysis on single-cell aspirates
(Chiang and Melton, 2003; Kamme et al., 2003; Tietjen et al.,
2003), the success rate was very low and this method is therefore not yet practical for profiling of a large number of individual neurons.
Finally, a fifth strategy to detect specific mRNA transcripts
from a single-cell is based on gene specific pre-amplification
employing multiplex-PCR (Edwards and Gibbs, 1994; Cauli et
al., 1997; Wang et al., 2002). Unfortunately, the number of
genes that can be simultaneously investigated using multiplex,
although large, is still limited. The main limitation of multiplex
PCR is interference among the multiple primers used for amplifying the different genes, requiring a lengthy calibration
procedure in which the optimal combination and relative
concentrations of primers and temperatures must be determined (Edwards and Gibbs, 1994).
A major drawback of all single-cell gene expression
approaches is the false negative rate (genes expressed but not
detected). The best current solution to this problem is to
obtain a large dataset and perform statistical modeling on a
population of neurons. In this study, we determined the
profiles of genes expressed by 203 neocortical neurons characterized electrically using patch clamp recordings combined
with the single-cell multiplex RT-PCR method (Lambolez et al.,
1992; Monyer and Jonas, 1995; Monyer and Lambolez, 1995;
Sucher and Deitcher, 1995; Cauli et al., 1997, 2000; Wang et
al., 2002; Fig. 1). Neurons were screened for the expression of
one house-keeping gene (GAPDH), three Ca2+ binding proteins
(CaBPs) and 26 ion channel genes for which the biophysical
properties have been established in the literature. We then
used statistical modeling approaches to determine the correlations between profiles of gene expression and profiles of electrical properties and tested the validity of the derived
correlation maps. This approach revealed the relationship
between electrical phenotype and a modest but physiologically
relevant subset of the neuronal transcriptome.

expression of 30 mRNA species from each cell. The genes co-amplified in each of three multiplex-PCR reactions were Pool I → (CB, PV,
CR and GAPDH), Pool II → (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.6, Kv2.1, Kv2.2, Kv3.1,
Kv3.2, Kv4.2, Kvβ1, Kvβ2, HCN1 and HCN2) and Pool III → (Kv1.4,
Kv3.3, Kv3.4, Kv4.3, HCN3, HCN4, Caα1A, Caα1B, Caα1G, Caα1I,
Caβ1, Caβ3, Caβ4 and SK2). Pool 1 was already calibrated to give PCR
products for each gene with even intensity (Cauli et al., 1997; Wang et
al., 2002). Pools 2 and 3 were calibrated to give PCR products for each
gene with even intensity starting from 1 ng of brain total mRNA.
During calibration different combinations of genes were distributed
between the two pools (2 and 3) and different primer pairs were
tested until an even amplification of all genes included in the pool was
obtained.
The first amplification round consisted of 10 min hot start at 95°C
followed by 25 cycles (94°C for 40 s, 56°C {Pools I and II} or 58°C
{Pool III} for 40 s and 72°C for 1 min) performed with a programmable thermocycler (Eppendorf, Germany). For each pool all genes
were simultaneously amplified in a single tube containing 1/10 (Pool
I) or 2/5 (Pools II and III) of the RT product, 100 nM of each of the
primers, 2 µM of each dNTP (Promega) and 5 U of HotStarTaq DNA
Polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in a final volume of 100 µl. A
second round of PCR consisted of 40 cycles (94°C for 40 s, 56°C
{Pools I and II} or 58°C {Pool III} for 40 s and 72°C for 1 min) was
performed. In this case, each gene was individually amplified in a
separate test tube containing: 1 µM of its specific primers, 2 µl of the
first PCR product (template), 2 µM of each dNTP and 5 U of
HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase, in a final volume of 20 µl. The products
of the second PCR were analyzed in 1.5% agarose gels using ethidium
bromide. Amplification specificity was randomly verified by restriction analysis.
Controls for the RT-PCR
For each PCR amplification, controls for contaminating artifacts were
performed using sterile water instead of cDNA. A control for nonspecific harvesting of surrounding tissue components was randomly
employed by advancing pipettes into the slice and retrieving without
seal formation and suction. Both types of controls gave negative
results throughout the study. Amplification of genomic DNA could be
excluded by the intron-overspanning location of many of the primers

controls in which the RT was omitted were performed giving negative
results.
Pre-processing Expression and Electrical Data
Electrophysiological measurements were considered outliers if the
value was six or more standard deviations from corresponding mean
each of the 61 electrophysiological parameters. These outliers
comprised only ∼1% of all measurements. Missing values were ignored
in computing means and standard deviations and deleted pairwise for
correlation analysis (below). For all analyses described below, each
electrophysiological parameter was z-normalized (mean of zero and
unit standard deviation) in order to provide a common scale of
comparison.

Results
Gene Expression Profiles
In order to correlate detailed electrical properties with gene
expression profiles, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp
recordings from neocortical neurons located in layers 2–6 of
the somatosensory cortex of rats (P13–16, Fig. 1a), applied a
comprehensive protocol for testing their electrical properties
(Fig. 1b) and harvested their cytoplasm (Fig. 1c) for subsequent
multiplex non-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1d,e). We studied the
simultaneous expression of 30 genes: 26 ion channels,
including the voltage activated K+ channels [Kv1.1/2/4/6
(Table 2), Kvβ1/2, Kv2.1/2, Kv3.1/2/3/4, Kv4.2/3] (Rettig

The Operator
The operator consists of a family of multivariate linear regression
models, one for each of the 61 z-normalized electrophysiological variables, fit by minimizing the least squares error (SYSTAT, Richmond,
CA; R Statistical System, v. 1.6.2, http://www.r-project.org). We used
10-fold cross-validation to estimate mean prediction error and to
obtain scatter plots of actual-versus-estimated values. To test the statistical significance of the operator, we compared its prediction error to
a distribution of errors obtained by generating 500 random cell-wise gProfile permutations, each of which was used to fit and cross-validate
a complete operator. To determine the most independent subsets of

predictor genes, we applied a bounds-and-branch exhaustive search
for best subsets (LEAPS algorithm; R Statistical System; Miller, 2002).
Searching for best subsets comprising 1–29 genes was computationally feasible for full model and bootstrapped modelling. We found no
changes in best subset distributions when increasing from 400 to 800
bootstrap replications. Genes that survived the bootstrap test are
defined as appearing in at least 80% of bootstrapped searches.

and Tibbs, 1999); the Ca2+ activated K+ channel (SK2) (Vergara
et al., 1998); the voltage activated Ca2+ channels (Caα1A/B/G/
I, Caβ1/3/4) (Moreno Davila, 1999); three CaBPs [Calbindin
(CB), parvalbumin (PV) and calretinin (CR)]; and the housekeeping gene GAPDH (as a quality control of the harvested
mRNA). While >100 ion channel genes are potentially
expressed in neurons, we focused on 26 thought to be crucial
for the active and passive electrical properties of neurons (Fig.
1e; see also Table 1 and Materials and Methods). This profile of
expressed genes by a specific neuron is referred to as g-Profile.
During recordings, neurons were also loaded with the dye
biocytin for subsequent histochemical staining to establish
their morphological identity (Fig. 1f).
The major drawback in single-cell gene expression profiling,
and in particular multiplex RT-PCR is a largely unknown
number of false negatives due to failed mRNA harvesting or
amplification (Monyer and Jonas, 1995). We addressed this
problem directly by (i) carrying out an extensive iterative calibration to control for and setup the multiplex, (ii) recording
from a large number of neurons (we recorded from 703
neurons, of which 115 were utilized for pharmacological tests
and controls), (iii) selecting neurons for the quality of their
expression and (iv) performing statistical modeling. The iterative calibration involved adjusting the concentration and
specific mixtures of primers in order to minimize interactions
as progressively more genes were added to the pool (Edwards
and Gibbs, 1994). Indeed, we discarded six K+ and Ca2+
channel genes (Ca1αE, SK1, SK3, KChIP1, KChIP2 and
KChIP3), because they could be reliably amplified individually,
but not within the multiplex. Occurrence of false positives was
ruled out in all cases by employing controls routinely
throughout the multiplex RT-PCR procedure (see Materials and
Methods). We encountered a false positive for only one gene
(Ca1αH) in two batches (68 cells) and this gene was excluded
from the entire study.
From a total of 703 neuronal recordings, 601 were harvested
(those not harvested were used for pharmacological tests and
controls). Of these, we selected the neurons expressing four or
more genes (including GAPDH and a minimum of two ion
channels; n = 203). Overall, 198 of these 203 neurons (97.5%)
expressed three or more of ion channel genes (Fig. 1g).

properties (Fig. 2). We focused on the discharge responses to
step current pulses (Fig. 2a), the shape of the first two action
potentials (APs) generated just above threshold (Fig. 2b), the
neuronal response to ramp current injection (Fig. 2c), the
change in the spiking behavior with time (Fig. 2d), the afterdepolarization generated by APs (Fig. 2e), the hyperpolarization after a burst of APs (Fig. 2f), the subthreshold currentvoltage relationship (Fig. 2g), the membrane time constant at
different potentials (Fig. 2h), the membrane time constant for
brief hyperpolarizing current pulses (Fig. 2i) and the resting
membrane potential. A numerical breakdown of the electrical
behavior was obtained by measuring various aspects of the
voltage responses to these stimulation protocols yielding 61
key electrical parameters (EPs) (Table 3). This profile of 61 EPs
representing the electrical behavior of each neuron is referred
to as the electrical profile or e-Profile of the neuron.
Correlating Gene Expression and Electrical Profiles
To determine whether it is possible to derive correlations
between gene expression and the phenotype, we first examined whether any relationship can be detected at all by
comparing corresponding gene expression and electrical
profiles across neurons. For each cell, the detected expression
of a gene was coded as one and the absence as zero, obtaining
what we refer to as the neuron’s gene expression profile or gProfile (does not include GAPDH in the analysis because all the
cells expressed this house-keeping gene). In this way, the gProfile of each cell was represented by a vector of 29 ones
(gene expressed) and zeros (gene not expressed; Fig. 3a). The
g-Profile of each cell (vector of binary values) was correlated
with the g-Profile of each of the other cells, thereby obtaining
a correlation matrix of similarity representing the degree too

which an expression profile of a cell compares with that of
others (Pearson correlation coefficient; Fig. 3a). On the colour
scale, colours towards red indicate cell pairs that are more
similar in terms of their gene expression profile. The same
correlation was performed for the electrical profiles (e-Profile)
except that the values were normalized analog values (Fig. 3b;
see Table 3). A z-normalization was performed across cells to
obtain a standard deviation of 1 around 0. Subsequently, the eProfile of each cell (vector of 61 analog z-normalized EP values)
was correlated with all other cells, producing another similarity matrix for the electrophysiological behavior (Fig. 3b; see
Materials and Methods).
Shown sorted in the same cell order (based on maximal clustering of the e-Profiles), the similarity of the two matrices is
very evident, indicating that neurons with similar electrical
expression profiles express similar genes. Indeed, the Pearson
correlation of these two matrices was 0.157 (95% CI = 0.144,
0.171), much higher than that expected by shuffling g- and eProfiles (P < 0.001). The Spearman rho, 0.150, was essentially
the same as the Pearson correlation, indicating no substantial
bias due to distributional assumptions. This highly significant
relationship of transcriptome subset and electrical phenotype
justifies the predictive linear regression modeling described
below.
Clusters of Expressed Genes
Before deriving the correlations between the gene expression
profile and the phenotype, we wanted to know whether there
is any detectable structure within the patterns of gene expression. We therefore carried out an unsupervised gene cluster
analysis (Ward, 1963; Fig. 3c) to determine co-expression
tendencies. Because we did not know a priori the number of

clusters to expect, we used a hierarchical technique that
begins by assigning each gene to its own class. The class of
each gene was represented by a vector or ones (expressed) and
zeros (not expressed) across all 203 cells. We computed the
Euclidian distance between each class (sum of squared differences) and then combined classes as we gradually relaxed this
distance criterion (Fig. 3c).
Four major clusters of genes that tend to co-express were
discovered. Interestingly, three of these clusters each
contained one of the three CaBPs widely used for classifying
neocortical neurons and therefore we named them according
to the CaBP they included. The ‘CR cluster’ contained SK2,
Kv3.4, CR and Caα1B; the ‘CB cluster’ contained CB, Caβ4,
HCN3, Kv1.4, Caα1G, Caβ1, HCN4, Kv3.3 and Caβ3; and the
‘PV cluster’ contained HCN2, Kv3.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.6, Kv1.1, PV,
Kv3.2, HCN1, Kvβ1 and Caα1A. These three clusters are also
consistent with the known biophysical properties of the
different ion channels and CaBPs, which may complement
each other to generate a broad class of discharge behaviors: the
CR cluster is associated with accommodation of discharge
(Vergara et al., 1998); the CB cluster is associated with bursting
behavior (Ertel and Ertel, 1997), and the PV cluster is associated with high frequency discharge (Martina et al., 1998; Chow
et al., 1999; Rudy and McBain, 2001). These three clusters are
also consistent with the known expression of CB, PV and CR in
different types of neocortical neurons, further validating the
sufficient level of accuracy of the expression profiling carried
out in this study as well as the sufficient numbers of cells
included in the data set for statistical modeling.

The Linear Operator
While many methods can be applied to derive the correlations
between two vectors, as a first step we chose linear regression
because this would allow reversible translation between
profiles of expressed genes and the electrical phenotype. This
operator provides coefficients, Ck, for the relative correlation
of the expression or non-expression of each gene, (mRNAk, 1
or 0, respectively) with the final value of each EP (EPi) (see
Materials and Methods; Fig. 3d):
29

EP i =

∑ (C

k

⋅ mRNA k ) ⋅ N i

k=1

where Ni is the normalization factor used to z-normalize EPi. A
profile of gene coefficients (PGC = {C1, C2, . . ., C29}) was
independently obtained for each EPi by fitting to the
multiple regression model with a least-squares error function. These regression coefficients provide a novel quantification of the relative correlation between the expression
and non-expression of individual genes in the context of coexpressed genes with the value of each EP. The coefficients
were represented on an analog scale where the highest coefficient predicts the maximal EP value recorded in any of the
203 cells (Fig. 4a).
Reliability of the Operator
The performance of the operator was tested in a number of
different ways. The first approach was to generate the operator

The Operator: General Observations
Figure 4a is a pseudocolored display of the regression coefficients (weights) for all 29 genes in predicting each of the 61
EPs. The first important observation is that each gene contributes significantly (adjusted for chance) to the prediction of
each EP. Secondly, best-subsets analysis showed that no simple
subset of genes can be used to predict all EPs, nor even EPs
with moderate correlation; on average an overlapping 42% of
genes independently predicts any given EP. Thirdly, the
average correlation among sets of gene-wise weights was very
low (mean, 0.02 ± 0.291), indicating that genes tend to
contribute independently in predicting the electrical profile.
We did, however, notice a few strong deviations from this
rule. Two gene trios were found to be strongly positively correlated (Kvβ2–PV, 0.7445; Kv1.4–PV, 0.6795; Kv1.4–Kvβ2,
0.5886) and (SK2–CR, 0.6336; SK2–Kv2.1, 0.597; Kv2.1–CR,
0.4954) indicating they are similarly correlated with the elec-

trical profiles. The genes in each trio were also strongly negatively correlated with the genes in the other group. This
indicates that the expression of each of these two trios correlates with nearly opposite electrical profiles. Further gene pairs
were found to be highly negatively correlated (Kv1.2–Kv3.1,
–0.679 and Kv1.2–Kv3.2, –0.636; HCN4–PV, –0.694 and
HCN4–Kvβ1, –0.63; Caβ4–SK2, –0.596 and Caβ4–CR, –0.614).
We then examined how these gene pairs and trios are coexpressed and found four principles of co-expression: (i) some
gene pairs such as SK2–CR, which have similar correlation
profiles, can be co-expressed (see Fig. 3c), while (ii) other
genes pairs, such as Kv1.1–Kv1.4 and PV–Kv1.4, which also
have similar correlation profiles, are seldom co-expressed; (iii)
gene pairs such as Kv1.2–Kv3.1 and Kv1.2–Kv3.2, which are
correlated with opposite electrical values, are often coexpressed; while (iv) other gene pairs such as HCN4–PV,
KCN4–Kvβ1, Caβ4–SK2 and Caβ4–CR, which are also correlated with opposite electrical values are seldom co-expressed.
The apparent conflict between these finding is discussed
further bellow.
We noticed that some differences and similarities between
the correlation profiles were surprising given their known
biophysical properties. For example, the two low threshold
Ca2+ channel genes, Caα1I and Caα1G, that both generate
rather similar T-type Ca2+ currents were found to be nearly
oppositely correlated with the frequency of the initial burst
(see Fig. 5a2). The correlation profiles for the delayed rectifiers Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 with very similar biophysical properties
(Wang et al., 1999) are also nearly opposite. Similarly for the
two hyperpolarization activated Na+/K+ channels HCN2 and
HCN4. We also found examples of genes with similar correlation profiles that produce ion channels with very different
biophysical properties. These include Kv4.3 (an A type
channel) and Kv2.1 (a delayed rectifier) as well as Kv3.3
(another type of delayed rectifier) and Kv4.3. However, when
we checked the co-expression of these genes pairs, we found
that they were expressed in different neurons, indicating that
the electrical properties with which an expressed gene is
correlated, is strongly influenced by the type of neuron in
which it is expressed.
The Operator: Specific Observations
The statistical validation of the operator provides confidence in
the correlation coefficients allowing a more detailed analysis of
the specific gene profile correlated with electrical properties.
Four categories of electrical properties are discussed: the AP
waveform, after hyperpolarization, passive properties and
discharge behavior.
The profile of expression that correlated positively with
brief APs, as found in high frequency discharging interneurons
(genes whose coefficients were more than twice the standard
deviation from the mean), includes PV, Kv1.4, Kvβ2, Kvβ1,
Kv1.1, Kv3.2, Kv3.1 and Caβ4 and the profile that is negatively
correlated includes CR, HCN1, HCN4, Caα1I, Caα1B, Kv1.2,

using only 90% of the cells and test the predictions of EP values
using the remaining 10%. Figure 4b shows an example where
several features of the AP waveform are predicted with >90%
accuracy for one cell belonging to the 10% test group. The
accuracy of using the coefficients to predict all 61 electrical
parameters for a representative cell is shown in Figure 4c. We
then generated 10 operators each time leaving out a different
10% of cells for the test set. The accuracy of predicting a single
EP (e.g. AP duration) in all 203 cells is shown in Figure 4d. To
evaluate the performance of the operator as a whole, for all
parameters and all cells, we compared its average prediction
error with the average prediction errors of operators generated
by randomly shuffling the g- and e-Profiles (P < 0.0001; Fig. 4d).
In another test we measured the variance accounted for by the
coefficients to make the predictions. The mean was 14%
(corrected R2 = 0.1443) for all the cells and all EPs, but the
corrected R2 was much higher for many EPs, some even greater
than 0.3, or 30%. The SD in the permutations is small, such that
3 SD is ∼0.1 R2 units. Therefore predictions with corrected R2
> 0.1, or 10%, are statistically meaningful (35 of the 61 EPs). An
average operator was also generated from the 10 partial operators with SDs that give an indication of the significance of the
coefficient (data not shown).
We further tested the significance of the coefficients by
searching for the minimal set of genes (best gene subsets, bGs)
that independently predict the EPs (open circles in Fig. 4a; see
Materials and Methods) and then tested which of these genes
would survive a bootstrap re-sampling of the bGs modeling
process, which tests for bias caused by under-sampling (solid
circles in Fig. 4a). The bGs and the subset of genes surviving
the bootstrap, overlay on virtually all strong, some moderate
and a few weak coefficients, supporting the significance of the
main predictions of the operator using these coefficients as
well as identifying the limitations of the derived operator due
to the methodological noise, nonlinearities, multicolinearities
and limited sample size.

The Operator as a Road Map
The linear operator is a correlation map that can now be used
to translate the profiles of genes expressed into the electrical
phenotype. These correlations do not imply any causality,
but they can be used as a road map to explore the numerous
potential causal steps between gene expression and the
emergent behaviour. As an illustration, we tested for the presence of the Kv1.1 protein whose mRNA expression was positively correlated with an index of stuttering discharge (STUT,
see Gupta et al., 2000) and which is supported by the best
subsets analysis (Fig. 4a, E52 ‘median of the distribution of
interspike intervals’). The presence of Kv1.1 protein in STUT
cells was confirmed by immunohistochemical (Fig. 5b1) and
pharmacological analysis. Indeed, application of dendrotoxin I
(DtxI, 20 nM, n = 9), which blocks Kv1.1/2/6 or dendrotoxin K
(DtxK, 10 nM, n = 9) which preferentially blocks Kv1.1
(Harvey, 1997), blocked stuttering and allowed unhindered
fast spiking and non-adapting discharges in all cells tested (Fig.
5b2). This finding is also consistent with the involvement of
Kv1.1 in a related firing pattern, the irregular discharging
neuron (Porter et al., 1998).

Discussion
Using single-cell multiplex RT-PCR combined with whole-cell
patch-clamp recordings we found a significant relationship
between profiles of gene expression and profiles of electrical
properties of neocortical neurons. We relied on this relationship to derive a linear operator that analytically predicts the
phenotype from the gene expression profile. This correlation
map represents the first quantification of the correlations
between the expression of a profile of genes and the emergent
phenotype. These coefficients provide a novel method with
which to quantify not only correlations for expressed genes
but also correlations for non-expressed genes with a spectrum
of specific electrical properties. Patterns within these coefficients verify and extend numerous previous reports in addition
to providing a spectrum of novel insights into which single
genes and profiles of genes, are correlated to electrical behaviors. Furthermore, the correlation map combined with a coexpression analysis revealed novel principles of expression
that may underlie the generation of electrical diversity.
The causal relationship between profiles of genes expressed
and the electrical phenotype could be quantifiable in future
studies by using the correlation map to generate hypotheses to
knock-out, express, or silence multiple genes in different
combinations and applying causally oriented statistical
modeling. Using the techniques applied here, it would be
possible to derive precise information about developmental
changes in ion channel and calcium binding protein expression, firing patterns and alterations that occur in cortical
circuits in human brain disorders and related animal models.
Moreover, the use of DNA microarrays with hundreds or
thousands of simultaneously-measured mRNAs could make it
possible to expand the descriptive and predictive accuracies of
our approach to the whole transcriptome; this could facilitate
identification of key nodes in complex networks, which can

SK2 and Kv2.1 (Fig. 4a, E7 ‘Average time from 1st AP onset’).
A similar profile of expression is also correlated with the 2nd
AP (Fig. 4a, E15 ‘Average time from 2nd AP onset’).
Many interneurons, especially the high frequency spiking
interneurons, exhibit large afterhyperpolarizations immediately after an AP (fAHP), which serves to remove Na+ channels
from inactivation permitting high frequency discharge. The
profile positively correlated with large amplitude fAHPs
includes PV, Kv1.6, Kv3.1, Kv3.2 Caα1G and Caβ4 and the
negatively correlated profile includes CR, Caα1I, Kv2.2, HCN4
and SK2 (Fig. 4a, E13 ‘Amplitude from 1st AP onset to
minimum voltage’). The amplitude of the intermediate AHP
following a burst of APs (measured as the amplitude at 100 ms
after a burst) is positively correlated with the expression of
SK2, HCN1, PV, Caα1B, CR, Kv1.2 and Kvβ1 and negatively
with Kv3.3, Kv3.1, Kv4.2 and Kv3.2 (Fig. 4a, E37 ‘Amplitude
of the AHP at 100 ms after the end of a burst of APs’).
Interneurons can differ greatly in terms of their input resistances (Chitwood et al., 1999). Figure 4a [E28 ‘Maximum input
resistance (peak voltage response to current injection)’ and
E29 ‘Input resistance at steady-state (steady-state of voltage
response to current injection)’] illustrates the gene expression
profiles that are positively correlated with the input resistance
at the peak and steady state following a step current injection.
The genes whose expression correlated positively with low
input resistances include PV, Kvβ2, Kv3.2 and Caα1G and the
expression profile correlated with high input resistances
include CR, SK2, Kv4.3 and Caβ1. Another important passive
property is a non-linear change in the membrane resistance
(rectification) as a function of voltage; the expression profile
correlated with high indices of refraction included HCN1, SK2,
HCN2, HCN3, Kv2.2, Caβ1, CB and Kv1.1 and the absence of
Kv3.3, Caα1B, Caα1A, Kvβ2 and Caα1I (Fig. 4a, E30 ‘Change in
input resistance at peak voltage’ and E31 ‘Change in input
resistance at steady-state voltage’). The resting membrane
potential may also vary >10 mV; the expression profile correlated with positive potentials includes SK2, CR, Caα1G, Kvβ1
and Kv2.1 and the absence of PV, Kvβ2, Kv2.2, Caα1B, Kv1.4
and HCN3 (Fig. 4a, E1 ‘Membrane potential at the onset of
whole-cell’). Finally, interneurons can differ strikingly in terms
of their thresholds for AP generation. When submitted to a
standard pulse (where the duration was fixed and the amplitude strength was scaled as described in Materials and
Methods) high thresholds are positively correlated with PV,
HCN1, Kv2.2, Caα1B, Caα1G and CR expression and negatively correlated with CB, Kv4.2, Kv3.4 and HCN4 expression
(Fig. 4a, E34 ‘Threshold to discharge APs during a ramp
depolarization’).
Figure 5a1 shows the representative responses for delayed
(d-, left) and rapid (b-, right) onset responses. EPs that distinguish these behaviors are the delay to spiking onset (Fig. 4a,
E42 ‘The average delay for the cell to generate a 2nd AP’) and
the mean inter-spike interval as the cell begins to discharge
(Fig. 4a, E44 ‘Average interspike interval for the first 3 APs’).
While differences in these two behaviors have been noted
previously (Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997; Gupta et al., 2000) it
was not suspected that these two behaviors were opposite
phenotypic classes of ‘fast reacting’ and ‘slowly reacting’
neurons until we noticed a near perfect inversion of the correlated gene expression profiles (Fig. 5a2).

Reliability of Correlation Coefficients
Any method that attempts to detect genes expressed in a
single-cell is likely to suffer from a significant incidence of false
negatives. In this study the number of false negatives depends
on the specific gene analyzed because each gene gives rise to a
different number of mRNA molecules. We directly addressed
this handicap by obtaining large numbers of neurons and
performing statistical modeling.
Several findings indicate that this approach is valid and reliable. Firstly, we found that cells with similar electrical behavior
also have statistically significantly similar gene expression
profiles. This finding together with the fact that these are two
methodologically independent measures indicates that the
expression and electrical profiling was sufficiently accurate to
justify statistical modeling.
Secondly, we found three main clusters of ion channel gene
co-expression, each one defined by a CaBP: CB, PV and CR. It
is known from immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization and
RT-PCR studies that these three CaBPs are largely expressed in
different types of neurons (reviewed in, for example, DeFelipe,
1997; Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997; Chow et al., 1999;
Toledo-Rodriguez et al., 2002) further supporting the accuracy

of the expression profiles as well as validating the sufficient
number of neurons obtained for this study. The expected
biophysical properties of the produced ion channels in each
cluster are also largely consistent with those supporting the
three broad classes of electrical behaviors found in neocortical
neurons (regular, bursting and fast firing). For example, several
delayed rectifiers, between them the two members of the Kv3
family Kv3.1 and KV3.2, which have been previously shown to
be highly correlated with narrow action potentials and highfrequency discharging (Martina et al., 1998; Erisir et al., 1999)
were found in the PV cluster that correlates with fast firing
neurons.
Thirdly, a cross-validation analysis indicated that many electrical parameters can be predicted with very low errors and
that the entire e-Profile can be predicted with an accuracy that
is statistically significant. Moreover, cross-validation was
performed on cells not involved in constructing the operator,
indicating that the coefficients allow predictions of electrical
parameters from gene expression profiles for new cells that
will be recorded in the future in this same species, age and
brain region. How these coefficients will generalize to other
species, ages and brain regions is an interesting issue for future
study.
Fourthly, the correlation coefficients verify many past
studies in terms of previously reported gene expression in
specific neocortical interneurons using single-cell RT-PCR and
other methods of ion channel localization, such as immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization and are consistent
with biophysical properties of the ion channels that would be
expected to result from this expression and their expected
impact on the electrical behavior. While very little is known
about which specific genes are expressed in single identified
neurons in the neocortex, our data confirms the findings of
those previous studies that reported a high correlation
between the expression of the CaBP PV, the powerful delayed
rectifiers Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 and fast spiking neocortical
interneurons with brief action potentials (see Martina et al.,
1998; Erisir et al., 1999; Rudy and McBain, 2001). We further
extended these findings by showing that while less frequent,
Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 are also expressed by neocortical pyramidal
neurons [which is in agreement with a similar finding in
hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Martina et al., 1998)].
In terms of consistency with predicted biophysical impact,
the coefficients reveal: (i) a high correlation between the
expression of the hyperpolarization activated Na+/K+ channels
HCN1, HCN2 and HCN3 and voltage rectification, as seen in
the hippocampus (see Magee, 1998); (ii) expression of the low
threshold Ca2+ channel Caα1I (see Lee et al., 1999) and the
auxiliary subunit Caβ3 (which accelerates the rate of inactivation of the voltage activated Ca2+ channels to facilitate a transient Ca2+ influx; Castellano et al., 1993), as in burst firing
neurons in the hypothalamus (Fan et al., 2001); (iii) the expression of Kv4.3 and Kvβ1 (which probably modifies Kv1.2 to
produce a transient A type channel) and high threshold Ca2+
channels in delayed discharge neurons, as in neurogliaform
cells in the neocortex (Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997); (iv) the
ion channels predicted to favor accommodation of the firing
rate are biophysically consistent (expression of SK2); (v) the
predicted Ca2+ channels that favor burst firing are biophysically
consistent (alpha subunit Caα1G in addition to its three beta
subunits Caβ1, Caβ3 and Caβ4, whose combined activity
enables the explosive increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concen-

and morphologically characterized neocortical neurons, this is
only a subset of the genes that are relevant to the neuron’s electrical behavior. Since the number of genes that can be included
in the multiplex is limited, we chose to include only those
genes that produce ion channels: (i) whose activity may add
significantly to the electrical behavior of neurons; (ii) whose
biophysics are also well known; (iii) shown to be expressed in
the neocortex (based on previous RT-PCR, immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization and pharmacological studies); and
(iv) known to have some causal relationship with the behavior
(Tanaka et al., 1995; Coetzee et al., 1999; Talley et al., 1999; Du
et al., 2000; Shibata et al., 2000; Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000;
Lien and Jonas, 2003). Aside from not selecting Na+ channel
genes, our strategy was to continue adding K+ and Ca2+ channel
genes to the multiplex until the calibration became too
complex.
The usual measure employed when correlating gene expression with electrical behavior of neurons is the ‘frequency of
expression’. This measure, however, is susceptible to methodological flaws in sensitively detecting mRNA expression and/or
accurately characterizing specific phenotypes. Our approach
to minimizing these biases was to quantify multivariate correlations between the expression of a gene and the value of a
large repertoire of specific electrical parameters. We did not
attempt to perform quantitative single-cell multiplex RT-PCR
for two reasons. First, technical difficulties increase as a function of the number of genes included in the multiplex due to
non-specific interactions and competition for the reagents.
Secondly, mRNA quantification will provide information about
only a small part of the molecular cascade that gives rise to the
phenotype. In order to unravel the causal chain of events
leading from gene expression to electrical behavior one would
also need to know the amount of protein translated from each
mRNA species, the degree of ion channel heteromerization,
the types of posttranslational modifications the protein undergoes, the functional state of each protein, the targeting of the
protein and the rate of protein turnover. Although the correlations and associations established in our study can not prove
causality they are required to support a causal hypothesis.

trations underlying the initial burst); and (vi) the predicted ion
channels that favor non-accommodation are also biophysically
consistent and tend to co-express with PV.
In summary, the main the reliability of the PCR methodology
is supported by: (i) the significant correlation among expression and electrical profiles; (ii) the predictive power of the
operator prediction electrical behavior from gene expression;
(iii) the consistency of our findings with previous reports of
expression in single neocortical neurons; and (iv) with the
known biophysical properties of the ion channels.

Gene Expression Principles
The coefficient matrix provides two measures of the relationship between gene expression and the electrical phenotype.
The first is a multi-gene coefficient profile to evaluate the
correlation of each gene with the value of a specific electrical
parameter and the second is a single-gene coefficient profile
that evaluates the correlation of one gene with the values of
multiple electrical parameters. Comparison of single-gene
coefficient profiles, revealed three features of the singlegene correlations. First, most genes displayed unique singlegene coefficients profiles, which indicates low potential
functional redundancy. Secondly, the expression of some
genes, even with different biophysical properties can demonstrate remarkably similar correlations with the electrical
profile. Thirdly, the expression of some genes, even very
similar biophysically, can demonstrate nearly opposite correlations with the electrical profile.
When we further combined these findings with the results
from the co-expression, we found evidence to suggest four
possible co-expression principles that may underlie the elec-

1324 Correlating Phenotype with Gene Expression • Toledo-Rodriguez et al.

Inversion of Gene Expression Profiles
Typically interneurons are classified into fast, burst and regular
firing. Recently a more detailed classification scheme was
proposed in which fast firing cells are sub-classified according
to their onset response: one sub-class where the neuron
responds to a depolarizing current pulse with a delayed
discharge, one sub-class in which the neuron begins with a
high frequency burst and one sub-class that does not display
any special onset response. The current study demonstrates
that the entire expression profile that was tested is inverted
when comparing delayed onset to burst onset neurons. This
finding indicates that these two subclasses of neurons, which
have previously been classified into the same broad group as
fast spiking, are essentially opposite types of neurons. To our
knowledge, such a phenomenon has never been reported
before and alludes to upstream control of the entire gene
expression profile possibly by a few transcription factors.
Understanding how many upstream genes control the expression of entire profiles of genes could solve a long-standing
problem of whether electrical behavior is expressed either to
form a continuous diversity or a finite number of classes.
Expression Principles in Different Morphological and
Electrophysiological Types
The present study purposefully avoided the problem of classifying electrical behavior according to the gross and subjectively defined electrical classes because the statistical modeling
approach requires an unbiased numerical breakdown of the
electrical phenotype. We recorded from as many different
types of neocortical neurons (including pyramidal neurons) as
possible so that the maximal ranges of values for the different
electrical parameters would be represented. The diversity in
this study is therefore an advantage rather than an intractable
problem. The study also included neurons with diverse
morphologies and since a correlation map could be derived
despite this morphological diversity, these correlations are independent of morphology. This does not mean that morphology
is irrelevant, just that the coefficients reflect the morphologyindependent component of the electrical behavior. Taking
morphology into account in future studies could add greatly to
understanding the relationship between ion channel genes,
morphology and electrical behavior. Nevertheless, solely based
on frequency of expression Kv2.1, HCN4, Kv4.2, Kv1.1 and
some of the voltage activated Ca2+ channels were the ion channels with the highest expression in pyramidal neurons, Kv3.1,
Kv3.2, Kv3.3, PV, HCN1, HCN2 and HCN3 were the ion channels with the highest expression in large basket cells and
Kv2.1, Kv3.3, Kv4.2, HCN4 and Kv3.1 were amongst the channels with the highest expression in Martinotti cells. This

Novel Correlations
This study reveals the simultaneous expression 26 of ion channels and 3 CaBPs in neocortical neurons and a significant and
quantifiable relationship between a small subset of the transcriptome and the electrical phenotype. This relationship
exposes the specific genes that are correlated with specific
electrical properties in neocortical neurons. For example, we
found, in addition to Kv3.1, Kv3.2 and PV that expression of
another delayed rectifier, Kv1.6, as well as the high threshold
Ca2+ channel gene Caα1G and its β subunit, Caβ4 are also
highly correlated with fast spiking, while CR, Caα1I, Kv2.2,
HCN4 and SK2 expression are anti-correlated with this firing
behavior. The operator also indicates that the precise pacing of
the discharge to minimize accommodation in fast spiking
neurons is correlated with the expression of the hyperpolarization activated channels HCN1 and HCN2 and of Kvβ1 which is
an auxiliary subunit of the Kv1 gene family that transforms
these delayed rectifiers into transient A type channels (Rettig et
al., 1994) that have important pacemaker properties (Adamson
et al., 2002). Indeed, we also found that blockade of HCN channels with the specific blocker ZD7288 (100 nM) converts high
frequency evenly spaced firing into an interrupted pattern
(data not shown).
This study further provides a cluster analysis of co-expression of multiple genes across a large number of neurons
revealing the specific ion channels that co-express with the
three major CaBPs. By combining the co-expression results
with the gene correlation coefficients, novel principles that
govern expression in these electrically diverse neocortical
neurons were found.

trical diversity: synergizing (genes expressed that correlate in
the same manner and found in the same cells, e.g. SK2-CR);
antagonizing (genes expressed that correlate oppositely but
found in the same cells, e.g. Kv1.2–Kv3.1 and Kv1.2–Kv3.2);
homogenizing (genes expressed that correlate in the same
manner but are expressed in different cells, e.g. Kv1.1–Kv1.4
and PV–Kv1.4); and heterogenizing (genes that correlate in the
opposite manner and expressed in different cells, e.g.
HCN4–PV, KCN4–Kvβ1, Caβ4–SK2 and Caβ4–CR). These
governing principles may enable the large diversity of electrical types and may explain how different morphological
types of neurons can express the same electrical behavior.

measure is not, however, optimal and further studies will be
needed for correlating gene expression with morphology and
electrophysiology.
Reverse Prediction
While we did not focus on the gene profiles for subjective
classes of neurons, this approach can be adapted to derive such
profiles. As an illustration, we derived a reverse operator to
predict the profile for any single cell (Fig. 6). Although there is
no simple analytical solution (expression is binary) and the
ratio of available neuronal exemplars to the number of EPs is
modest, we can use an iterative, stepwise optimization technique to accurately predict the gene expression profile. For
example, we found that at least 17 EPs are required to make a
reliable prediction (data not shown). The best EPs that reliably
predict >10 genes (EP1, EP11, EP14, EP17, EP30, EP31, EP37,
EP46, EP50, EP58; data not shown) were also isolated. The
same approach could in principle be used in the future to
predict the gene profile for any subjectively defined type of
neuron from its averaged electrical profile.

Summary
In summary, we report here the first study correlating detailed
whole-cell electrophysiological properties with an extensive
profile of simultaneously expressed ion channel and calcium
binding protein mRNAs. We found clustering of ion channel
genes around three major calcium binding proteins. Regression
modeling with statistical re-sampling yielded a set of coeffi-

cients that reliably predicted electrical properties from the
expression profile of individual neurons. Further studies would
be required to determine whether this same map also predicts
electrical behavior in neurons from other brain regions and
other species and, thereby, whether many different or one
universal transcription formula is used for all neurons to
generate electrical diversity.

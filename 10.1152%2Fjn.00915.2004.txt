When the brain goes from wakefulness to sleep, cortical neurons
begin to undergo slow oscillations in their membrane potential that are
synchronized by thalamocortical circuits and reflected in EEG slow
waves. To provide a self-consistent account of the transition from
wakefulness to sleep and of the generation of sleep slow waves, we
have constructed a large-scale computer model that encompasses
portions of two visual areas and associated thalamic and reticular
thalamic nuclei. Thousands of model neurons, incorporating several
intrinsic currents, are interconnected with millions of thalamocortical,
corticothalamic, and both intra- and interareal corticocortical connections. In the waking mode, the model exhibits irregular spontaneous
firing and selective responses to visual stimuli. In the sleep mode,
neuromodulatory changes lead to slow oscillations that closely resemble those observed in vivo and in vitro. A systematic exploration of
the effects of intrinsic currents and network parameters on the initiation, maintenance, and termination of slow oscillations shows the
following. 1) An increase in potassium leak conductances is sufficient
to trigger the transition from wakefulness to sleep. 2) The activation
of persistent sodium currents is sufficient to initiate the up-state of the
slow oscillation. 3) A combination of intrinsic and synaptic currents is
sufficient to maintain the up-state. 4) Depolarization-activated potassium currents and synaptic depression terminate the up-state. 5)
Corticocortical connections synchronize the slow oscillation. The
model is the first to integrate intrinsic neuronal properties with
detailed thalamocortical anatomy and reproduce neural activity patterns in both wakefulness and sleep, thereby providing a powerful tool
to investigate the role of sleep in information transmission and
plasticity.

The transition from wakefulness to sleep is accompanied by
striking changes in neural activity, which are evident at the
level of individual neurons recorded intracellularly as well as at
the population level recorded by the electroencephalogram
(EEG). During wakefulness, cortical neurons are tonically
depolarized and fire at irregular intervals, giving rise to an EEG
characterized by low-voltage, fast-activity patterns. With the
onset of slow-wave sleep, virtually all cortical neurons undergo
a slow oscillation (Ͻ1 Hz) in their membrane potential (Steriade 2003). The slow oscillation is composed of a hyperpolarized phase or “down-state” during which neurons are deeply
hyperpolarized and remain silent for a few hundred milliseconds. The down-state is followed by a depolarized phase or
“up-state,” also lasting several hundred milliseconds, during
which neurons fire at rates that are even higher than in quiet
wakefulness. These fluctuations in membrane potential are

reflected in the cortical EEG as slow waves of high-voltage
activity.
The slow oscillation is the fundamental cellular phenomenon
that groups and organizes sleep rhythms such as slow-wave
activity and sleep spindles (Steriade 2003). After its discovery
in anesthetized cats (Steriade et al. 1993), the slow oscillation
has been investigated during natural sleep in vivo (Achermann
and Borbely 1997; Steriade et al. 2001), in cortical slabs
(Timofeev et al. 2000), in vitro in cortical slice preparations
(Mao et al. 2001; Sanchez-Vives and McCormick 2000), and in
computo (Bazhenov et al. 2002; Compte et al. 2003). These
studies have revealed that both intrinsic currents and various
kinds of synaptic interactions are involved in initiating, maintaining, and terminating the slow oscillation, and that corticocortical circuits are involved in synchronizing it (Amzica and
Steriade 1995b).
To integrate the information gathered from these different
experimental approaches, we have constructed a large-scale
model of the thalamocortical system that aims to provide a
coherent account of the transition from wakefulness to sleep
and the generation of the slow oscillation at several different
levels—from ion channel kinetics to global EEG phenomena.
The model incorporates key aspects of the neuroanatomical
organization of the thalamocortical system, including two visual cortical areas subdivided into multiple layers, corresponding thalamic and reticular sectors, and several millions of intraand interareal connections linking Ͼ65,000 spiking neurons.
Moreover, the model incorporates several types of intrinsic
conductances (mediating the hyperpolarization-activated cation current Ih, low-threshold calcium current IT, persistent
sodium current INa(p), potassium leak current IKL, depolarization-dependent potassium current IDK—representing
Ca2ϩ and Naϩ-dependent Kϩ currents) and synaptic currents [␣-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), ␥-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA), ␥-aminobutyric acid-B (GABAB)].
Because of these properties, the model is able to reproduce
experimental data ranging from intracellular traces and multiunit rasters to optical imaging–like voltage patterns and EEGlike field potentials. Moreover, by simulating changes in intrinsic currents arising from the reduced release of neuromodulators, the model can switch from a waking to a sleep mode of
activity. Specifically, in the waking mode the model reproduces spontaneous activity patterns as well as selective responses to visual stimuli that are seen in vivo. After transitioning to the sleep mode, the model engages in slow oscillations
that closely resemble those observed experimentally. By providing a comprehensive view of all system variables and by

permitting idealized “experimental” manipulations, the model
provides a self-consistent account of the mechanisms responsible for the initiation, maintenance, and termination of the
slow oscillation and of its synchronization within and across
thalamocortical circuits.
METHODS

In the next sections, we describe the principles used to construct
and scale the simulated cortical and thalamic regions, the layout of the
various connection pathways within and among these regions, and the
implementation of cellular and synaptic properties. We then describe
the sources of spontaneous activity, the procedures for the collection
and analysis of data, and the actual computer implementation.

Regional organization
The model (Fig. 1) is organized in
regions and pathways consisting of a primary and a secondary area of
visual cortex, two corresponding regions of the dorsal thalamus, and
two regions of the reticular thalamic nucleus. The primary visual area
(Vp) represents a restricted portion of cat striate cortex (area 17) and

PRIMARY CORTICAL AREA.

it contains units with small receptive fields that are selective for
oriented segments. The simulated cortex is divided into 3 layers with
different patterns of afferent, efferent, and local connectivity corresponding to supragranular layers (L2–3), infragranular layers (L5– 6),
and layer 4 (L4).
In the cat, the striate cortex exhibits a basic periodicity of structure
and function at the scale of about 1 mm. This organization is
manifested both in terms of the center-to-center distance of isoorientation bands (Kisvarday and Eysel 1993; Kisvarday et al. 1997; Lowel
et al. 1987) and in terms of the average separation of neighboring
axonal termination patches in supragranular layers (Kisvarday and
Eysel 1992). To constrain our model, we assume that an area of
roughly 1.0 mm2 forms a basic macrounit in the striate cortical mosaic
array. Vp is scaled to span 64 (8 ϫ 8) such macrounits. Therefore Vp
corresponds to approximately 0.8 cm2 of striate cortical surface and
spans a monocular patch of 8 ϫ 8° in the parafoveal visual field. Each
macrounit in the model contains discrete groups of orientation selective cells. In the present model, 2 groups of cells selective for vertical
and horizontal oriented input represent a simplified version of the X
pathway for one eye.
Figure 2 shows the detailed orientation-selective, feedforward, and
feedback circuitry for one horizontally selective and one vertically
selective macrounit. Each topographic location (topographic element)

diffuse inhibitory projections to thalamocortical neurons in Tp and Ts. (3) Cortical interlaminar (vertical) loops: columnar projections are made from L4 to L2–3
(corresponding to supragranular layers 2–3), from L2–3 to L5– 6, and from L5– 6 back to L4 and L2–3. (4) Cortical intralaminar (horizontal) connections: each
layer contains excitatory projections (shown only for L2–3 in Vp) forming connections between patches of cells with similar response selectivity (for horizontal
or vertical bars). (5) Interareal corticocortical loops: forward projections from L2–3 of Vp to L4 of Vs; backward projections from L5– 6 of Vs to L2–3 of Vp.

FIG. 2. Schematic of modeled orientation-selective receptive fields, feedforward and feedback projections. Feedforward
connections start with visual input to the elements of the model
thalamus (Tp). Each topographic element in Tp contains one
excitatory (white circle) and one inhibitory (black circle) neuron. Rp contains one inhibitory cell per topographic element.
Each topographic element in layers L5– 6, L4, and L2–3 consists of 2 excitatory and one inhibitory cell. Excitatory cells in
Tp project to inhibitory cells in Rp and both excitatory and
inhibitory cells in L4 and L5– 6. Orientation selectivity is
achieved by the convergence of afferents from an oriented
rectangular region in Tp onto individual cortical cells in L4 and
L5– 6. All excitatory cells in L4 and L5– 6 receive oriented
input from Tp. Red marks the receptive field and projection
patterns for a cortical cell selective for horizontal input. Blue
marks the receptive field and projection patterns for a cortical
excitatory cell selective for vertical input. Feedback connections (shown in green) show the projection pattern from L2–3 to
L5– 6, and from L5– 6 to Rp and Tp. These connections are
present for both horizontally and vertically selective cells.

in the model cortex is considered to correspond to a cortical column,
which is represented by 9 model neurons (2 excitatory and 1 inhibitory for each of the 3 layers). All topographic elements in Vp are
organized in maps of 40 ϫ 40 elements for each of the 2 modeled
orientation selectivities (horizontal and vertical). Orientation selectivity is achieved by the convergence of afferents from an oriented
rectangular region in Tp onto individual cortical cells in L4 and L5– 6.
The subdivision of the modeled cortical areas in elements spanning all
layers reflects the developmental, anatomical, and physiological evidence for a basic columnar organization of neocortex (Gilbert 1993;
Mountcastle 1997, 1957; Rakic 1995).
Assuming that different selectivities are mapped onto nonoverlapping
pieces of cortex, and that there are about 62,000 neurons beneath 1 mm2
of cortical surface in area 17 (Beaulieu and Colonnier 1983), each
topographic element corresponds to a cortical column with a surface area
of 1,454 ␮m2 and containing approximately 94 neurons. Because we
explicitly model only 9 cells for each topographic element, each modeled
cell represents the activity of approximately 10 cortical neurons, making
the topographical elements in the model comparable to the basic cortical
modules proposed by Peters and Payne (1993). Although the ratio of
modeled excitatory/inhibitory cells (66%/33%) is not exactly the same as
that observed in vivo (about 80%/20%) because of computational considerations, the observed ratio of excitatory/inhibitory synapses is maintained (see following text).

V1 is 1,120 mm2 and V4 is 540 mm2 (Felleman and Van Essen
1991)]. In the model, Versus is based on some general properties
associated with extrastriate areas (e.g., an enlargement of receptive
fields) and with termination patterns of “forward” and “backward”
corticocortical projections (Felleman and Van Essen 1991; Van Essen
et al. 1992). Vs contains neurons that are selective for either vertical
lines, horizontal lines, or line crossings, organized in a coarse topographic map. For each of its 3 selectivities, Vs has a map of 30 ϫ 30
elements (for a total of 24,300 model neurons) as compared with the
40 ϫ 40 (totaling 28,800 model neurons) elements in Vp.

The secondary visual area (Vs) corresponds to an extrastriate area located along the ventral occipitotemporal pathway. Although Vs does not represent in detail any particular
region of visual cortex, we use area 21 in the cat as a reference, which
is the presumed homolog of cortical area V4 in the monkey (Payne
1993). Vs is assumed to be about half the size of Vp [in the monkey,

According to Peters and Payne (1993), there is
a rough correspondence between the number of X-cells in the lateral
geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the number of basic cortical modules in
area 17. We therefore model a geniculate map (Tp) composed of the
same number of elements (40 ϫ 40) as Vp. Each element of Tp
contains 2 modeled neurons that correspond respectively to an X-relay
cell and to an inhibitory interneuron. For simplicity of implementation, only the ON-portion of thalamic receptive fields is modeled. The
secondary thalamic map (Ts) has 30 ϫ 30 elements and its visuotopic
arrangement has a much lower spatial resolution than that of Tp. Two
sectors of the reticular nucleus, primary perigeniculate (Rp) and
secondary higher-order (Rs), are modeled respectively as a 40 ϫ 40
and a 30 ϫ 30 map of inhibitory neurons.

THALAMIC SECTORS.

In constructing the model, special emphasis was placed on the
incorporation of realistic network properties, such as the spread and
relative proportions of the various sets of connections composing the
intra- and interregional thalamocortical circuitry. Specific patterns of

arborization are classified as either focused or diffuse, on the basis of
anatomical data. The focused connection pattern diverges for single
arbors over a topographically registered region with a diameter of 5
target elements. Diffuse projections typically cover an area with a
diameter of 25 elements for a single arbor. Contacts from individual
arbors in the target area are made probabilistically according to
Gaussian spatial density profiles. The proportion of synapses from
different sources was used as a constraint in the parameterization of
the various density profiles (Table 1). Two books, by Sherman and
Guillery (2001) and White and Keller (1989), were particularly
helpful in the development of this model.
VERTICAL INTERLAMINAR CONNECTIONS. Interlaminar connections
couple neurons vertically through the cortical depth. These connections may be described as part of a loop that includes the following
major steps (Gilbert 1993; Mountcastle 1997): from layer IV to
supragranular layers, from supragranular to infragranular layers, and
from infragranular back to layer IV and to supragranular layers
(Callaway and Wiser 1996; Wiser and Callaway 1996, 1997). All
these projections are made in a focused manner in the model. As a
further constraint, we consider the proportion of synapses from
different sources in each layer. As an example, for each simulated
excitatory cell of layer IV, there are on average 40 interlaminar
connections from infragranular layer and 23 intralaminar connections
from layer IV, in close agreement with the 45% ratio reported in the
cat striate cortex (Ahmed et al. 1994). A similar connectivity was
established in each map of Versus.
HORIZONTAL INTRALAMINAR CONNECTIONS. Individual excitatory
neurons in the supragranular layers of striate cortex have intralaminar
horizontal projections that tend to be organized in patches of 200 – 400
mm in diameter. These patches typically interconnect neurons that
have similar orientation preference (Kisvarday et al. 1997). Patches
originating from a single location extend over a region of roughly 2– 4
mm (Gilbert 1993). In the model, horizontal connections in the
supragranular layer of Vp are made diffusely onto isoorientation cells,
with an equivalent spread of 5.5 ϫ 5.5 mm2. Intrinsic connections in
the infragranular layer of Vp have a similar organization. Intralaminar
connections in layer IV extend over a more limited area with a
diameter of 15 elements. This reduced projective field reflects the
more compact arborization in layer IV (Douglas and Martin 2003).
INTRACORTICAL INHIBITORY CONNECTIONS. The cerebral cortex
contains many different types of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons
(Douglas and Martin 2003; Jones 1993). Among these, basket cells
are ubiquitous and project mostly to the same layer where their soma
is located. Double-bouquet cells are concentrated in supragranular
layers (Conde et al. 1994; Kawaguchi 1995; Kawaguchi and Kubota
1997; Peters and Sethares 1997) and their projections are organized in
a restricted columnar arrangement that extends to most layers. There
are indications that basket cells and other inhibitory interneurons act
through fast GABAA-receptors, whereas double-bouquet cells may
preferentially activate GABAB receptors (Kang et al. 1994). In the
model, basketlike cells provide a fast (GABAA-like) inhibition within
each cortical layer to all cell types; double-bouquet analogs located in
supragranular layers provide a slow (GABAB-like) inhibitory control
of a narrow cylinder extended to all 3 layers.
The relationship between inhibition and orientation selectivity in
the visual cortex is complex. However, some recent studies suggest
that a single basket cell in the cat visual cortex provides input to
surrounding regions representing the whole range of orientations,
including iso- and cross-orientations to that basket cell soma (Kisvarday and Eysel 1993; Kisvarday et al. 1994). In the model, we assume
that lateral inhibition (GABAA) is provided equally to both of the
modeled orientation selectivities in Vp. In Vs, half of the terminals of
individual basketlike cells in Vs provide input to cells with similar
selectivity to that of the parent soma, whereas the remaining half are
split evenly between cells of other selectivities. The density profile of

J Neurophysiol • VOL

inhibitory connections was adjusted such that the relative proportions
of inhibitory connections per layer are comparable to the values
reported in the literature (i.e., about 10 –20% of all synapses) (Beaulieu and Colonnier 1985; Beaulieu et al. 1992).
FORWARD AND BACKWARD INTERAREAL CONNECTIONS. According to several studies, backward connections are considerably more
divergent than forward connections. This has been documented for
projections from area MT to V1 and V2 of primates (Krubitzer and
Kaas 1989; Rockland and Knutson 2000; Shipp and Zeki 1989; Zeki
and Shipp 1989) and from V2 to V1 (Henry et al. 1991; Rockland and
Van Hoesen 1994; Rockland and Virga 1989). Reconstructions of
single axons indicate that forward projections from V1 and V2
(Rockland 1992; Rockland and Knutson 2000; Rockland and Virga
1989) to V4 have discrete terminal clusters (2– 4 clusters per axon,
250 mm wide), which are distributed over 2 to 2.5 mm. Conversely,
individual axons from V4 to V1 diverge Յ5 mm (Rockland et al.
1994). These values should be compared with values around 2 to 5
mm for horizontal connections in V1. According to a classic description, forward projections tend to originate in superficial layers and to
terminate in layer 4, whereas backward connections tend to originate
from infragranular as well as supragranular layers and to terminate
outside layer 4 (Rockland and Pandya 1979). This basic scheme has
since become considerably more complicated (Felleman and Van
Essen 1991; Maunsell and van Essen 1983). However, in the model,
forward connections originating from the supragranular layer of Vp
defined the 3 feature-specific responses in Vs. These selectivities
resulted from biased convergent projections onto individual L4 neurons of Versus from either a 19 ϫ 3 region of vertical selective cells,
a 3 ϫ 19 region of horizontal selective cells, or from both selectivities
of Vp (9 ϫ 3 and 3 ϫ 9 regions, respectively). Backward projections
from vertical and horizontal selective cells of Vs originate in the
infragranular layer and terminate diffusely in the supragranular layer
of Vp, targeting cells of similar orientation specificity. In contrast,
backward projections from cross-selective cells extend to both selectivities in Vp. The laminar specificity of projections between Vp and
Vs was consistent with that observed between cat areas 17 and 21
(Rosenquist 1985).
THALAMIC CONNECTIONS. Relay cells in the LGN have strong,
driving connections to the cortex, and form collaterals only with the
reticular nucleus (RT), whereas interneurons in the LGN inhibit other
interneurons as well as relay cells with a focused connectivity pattern.
RT neurons make diffuse connections within the RT nucleus and to
thalamic relay nuclei (Dubin and Cleland 1977). In the model, local
interneurons produce (fast) GABAA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic
potentials (IPSPs) in thalamocortical relay cells. Thalamic to reticular
projections (i.e., from Tp to Rp and from Ts to Rs) are made according
to the focused connection scheme. RT projections target their corresponding relay sectors of the thalamus in a diffuse manner. Both
GABAA and GABAB IPSPs mediate the RT inhibition of thalamic
relay and interneurons, in accord with the inhibitory effect observed
when RT cells fire tonically (Kim and McCormick 1998; Kim et al.
1997; Pinault and Deschenes 1992).
THALAMOCORTICAL AND CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS. Xcells in cat laminae A and A1 of the LGN send axons that terminate
mainly in layer IV and VI of area 17 (Freund et al. 1989; LeVay and
Gilbert 1976; Leventhal 1979). In the model, each simulated cell in L4
of Vp received connections selected from an 8 ϫ 2 region of the
thalamic map for the vertical selectivity (2 ϫ 8 for the horizontal
selectivity). Infragranular cells received about half as many connections from the same geniculate regions. The convergence of projections from these horizontal or vertical patches within the thalamus
promoted orientation-specific responses in the cortex. Note that, in the
model, the same X-cell targets both horizontal and vertical cortical
cells, such that its arbor extends over at least half of an orientation
cycle or 0.55 mm. This dimension is consistent with anatomical

Connectivity patterns are specified as follows: source area, layer of origin, and cell type (E, excitatory, I, inhibitory) and selectivity (V, vertical; H, horizontal;
C, cross); target area, layer of termination, and cell type and selectivity; type of synaptic channel activated by the connection; style of connection pattern
(Gaussian: connections are selected according to a Gaussian distribution with a peak of Pmax and a width of ␴, Rectangular: connections are selected by the
maximum probability within a rectangular area, Constant-connections are selected according to the maximum probability over the entire radius specified);
maximum probability of connection (Pmax); standard deviation (␴) of the Gaussian distribution used to generate connections (scaled according to the radius);
radius of the target area in which the projections from a single source cell diverge (expressed in number of topographic elements along vertical and horizontal
axis in target map); strength of the connections (expressed in number of simultaneous PSPs per connection); mean Ϯ SD of the delay of the spike impulse from
the source cell to the target cells. Intrinsic cortical connections, corticothalamic projections from Vp to Tp and Rp, thalamocortical and corticothalamic
projections from Vs to Ts and Rs, are isomorphic for the various selectivities; as a reference, we give only the connectivity patterns originating from cells selective
for vertical orientations. Thalamocortical projections from Tp to Vp and interareal projections are biased and rectangular so as to produce feature selectivities;
these projections are described for all the selectivities present in the model.

evidence that X axonal terminals form a single elongated clump in
area 17, about 1 mm long ϫ 0.6 – 0.8 mm wide (Freund et al. 1985).
Versus cells in L4 and the infragranular layer receive thalamocortical
projections converging from a region of Ts with a diameter of 4
elements. Thalamocortical projections account for about 8% of all
connections received by layer IV neurons, consistent with anatomical
estimates (Ahmed et al. 1994; Latawiec et al. 2000; Peters and Payne
1993). Corticothalamic axons descend from the infragranular excitatory cells into their corresponding thalamic relay sectors, contacting
all cell types present in these structures, consistent with anatomical
data (Montero 1991; Robson 1983; Weber et al. 1983). En route, such
fibers send collaterals to the RT nucleus. Consistent with experimental
observations (Golshani et al. 2001), corticoreticular projections are
substantially stronger (2.5ϫ) than corticothalamic projections. The
topography of corticothalamic connectivity matches that of the
thalamocortical connectivity (Jones 2002).

Transmission delays
Transmission of signals within and across cortical areas occurs
through several successive stages, including axonal conduction, synaptic delays, and postsynaptic potential (PSP) generation. Each of
these stages is associated with delays in the transmission of a signal.
Measured latencies between the firing of successive visual cortical
areas in the cat have been estimated to lie between 5 and 15 ms (Dinse
and Kruger 1994) in the forward direction. Geniculocortical latencies
may be even shorter (Bullier and Henry 1979). Backward connections
may be slower conducting. For instance, latencies from areas 18 and
19 to area 17 are 6 and 10 ms, respectively (Bullier et al. 1988).
Because of the fact that the simulated cortices contain only 3 layers
(instead of 6), we account for experimentally measured latencies
along polysynaptic pathways by assuming comparatively longer transmission delays along certain pathways. Transmission delays for individual connections are sampled from Gaussian distributions with a SD
of 1 ms. Each set of connections in the model is associated with a
specific mean delay. Mean conduction delays are set to 2 ms for
intralaminar connections and for most interlaminar connections. Infragranular to layer 4 connections are delayed on average by 7 ms, to
account for disynaptic transmission through layers 5 and 6. Thalamocortical connections and forward connections from Vp to Vs have a
mean delay of 3 ms, whereas corticothalamic connections and backward connections from Vs to Vp have a mean delay of 8 ms, again
taking into account a disynaptic pathway through layers 5 and 6.

Model neurons
Both excitatory and inhibitory neurons are modeled as singlecompartment spiking neurons incorporating Hodgkin–Huxley style
currents. To model the contributions of key intrinsic currents, while
preserving the computational efficiency of integrate-and-fire neurons
that is necessary when computing a large-scale network, we devised
a simplification of the fast-spiking currents (INa and IK). Model
neurons thus behave like a hybrid between traditional integrate-andfire neurons and full-fledged Hodgkin–Huxley neurons.
A dynamic threshold (␪) is defined for each cell that determines at
which membrane potential the cell should fire
d␪
ϭ Ϫ ͑ ␪ Ϫ ␪ eq ͒/ ␶ ␪
dt

The resting threshold (␪eq) determines the equilibrium threshold
potential for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The threshold
time constant ␶␪ determines the time to return to the equilibrium
threshold. The specific values were chosen to match absolute refractory periods for different neuron types (Table 2).
The change in membrane potential V for each neuron is as follows
dV
ϭ ͓ Ϫ gNaL͑V Ϫ ENa͒ Ϫ gKL͑V Ϫ EK͒ Ϫ Isyn Ϫ Iint͔/␶m Ϫ gspike͑V Ϫ EK͒/␶spike
dt

where the conductances for the sodium leak (gNaL ϭ 0.2) and
potassium leak (gKL ϭ 1.0–1.85) are the primary determinants of the
resting membrane potential. Conductance units are dimensionless
because of the fact that the neurons do not have a defined area or
volume.
When the membrane potential V exceeds the threshold ␪, a spike is
generated by setting both V and ␪ instantaneously to the sodium
reversal potential (ENa ϭ 30 mV), modeling the contribution of the
fast-spiking INa current. The activation of a fast potassium current
during a spike is represented by a brief pulse (duration tspike, Table 2)
with an amplitude of gspike ϭ 1, thereby driving the membrane
potential toward the potassium reversal potential (EK ϭ Ϫ90 mV),
while continuing to integrate intrinsic and synaptic currents. The

membrane potential and is therefore governed by a “spike” time
constant (␶spike Յ ␶m). The cell is unable to fire until ␪ Յ V. With
these three parameters, ␶␪, ␶spike, and tspike, we model key characteristics of spike generation including action potential width, afterhyperpolarization, and relative refractory period (Table 2).
The membrane time constants ␶m are consistent with experimental
data (Baranyi et al. 1993; Connors et al. 1982; Kim and Connors
1993; Mason et al. 1991).
Two main categories of input currents contribute to the membrane
potential, synaptic input (Isyn) and intrinsic currents (Iint), which are
described below.

Synaptic channels
The synaptic input Isyn is the sum of all synaptic channel currents,
I syn ϭ ijg͑i͒
j ͑V Ϫ Ej͒. Simulated synaptic channels provide voltagedependent (NMDA-like) and voltage-independent (AMPA-like) excitation, as well as fast (GABAA-like) and slow (GABAB-like) inhibition. The conductance for each afferent i, on each channel j, specifies
the amplitude and time course of the PSPs. The reversal potential for
each channel Ej determines whether a current is inhibitory or excitatory. Electrical couplings between cortical inhibitory populations have
been observed experimentally (Galarreta and Hestrin 1999) but are
not modeled here.
Synaptic activation is expressed as the change of a channel conductance, g(t), according to a dual-exponential response to single
spike events, given by

Conductances are implicitly normalized by a leak membrane conductance and are adimensional. The time constants and reversal potential
for each channel type were taken from the neurophysiological literature (Otis and Mody 1992; Otis et al. 1993; Stern et al. 1992). The
peak conductances gpeak were chosen to conform to a few simple
constraints that led to regular network behavior. These constraints
consisted of having: 1) peak excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) of 1 mV in AMPA-like channels; 2) matched integrated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) through AMPA and unblocked
NMDA channels; 3) matched integrated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) through GABAA and GABAB channels. The activation
of NMDA-like channels was expressed as
g˜ NMDA ϭ m͑V͒gNMDA͑t͒,

where gNMDA(t) is a dual-exponential impulse response and m(V) is a
sum of 2 exponentials functions with fast and slow time constants,
which modulates the change in the NMDA conductance. This modulation mimics the voltage-dependent affinity of the Mg2ϩ located
inside the channel pore. Additionally, although the blocking of
NMDA channels by Mg2ϩ occurs instantaneously (Ͻ0.06 ␮s) there is
a slower dynamic to the unblocking process occurring on 2 timescales,
as recently described (Vargas-Caballero and Robinson 2003). Based
on this work, we model a 2-stage unblocking process with one
component that unblocks quickly (about 1 ms) and a second slow
component that unblocks in about 20 ms. Specific parameter settings
for the different type of synaptic channels are listed in Table 3.
AMPA-like channels are used for most excitatory connections
implemented in the model. For horizontal connections in supragranular layers, vertical projections from supragranular to infragranular

layers, as well as for backward connections from Versus to supragranular cells of Vp, we add model voltage-dependent NMDA-like
channels. This choice enabled these connections to modulate the firing
of target units without disrupting their response selectivity. Evidence
supporting this choice includes the finding that voltage-gated NMDA
receptors are denser in the supragranular layers of visual cortex (Fox
et al. 1989; Rosier et al. 1993); in addition, the effectiveness of these
connections seems in part contingent on a concomitant depolarization
of target cells that are not in visuotopic register with the sources of
afferentation (Bullier et al. 1988; Hirsch and Gilbert 1991; Salin and
Bullier 1995).
Inhibition in the thalamus was mediated by fast (GABAA-like)
synapses. Because of nucleus specific differences in the chloride
reversal potential, reticulothalamic GABAA (TC) channels had a
reversal potential more negative for thalamic relay cells (about Ϫ80
mV) than for cells found in the reticular nucleus (about Ϫ70 mV)
(Ulrich and Huguenard 1997).

There is substantial evidence that the rapid plasticity of excitatory
and inhibitory synaptic responses is dominated by short-term depression and caused by the depletion of presynaptic pools of readily
releasable neurotransmitter vesicles (Zucker and Regehr 2002). In the
model, short-term depression of both excitatory and inhibitory connections was based on a simple vesicle pool model (Abbott et al.
1997; Galarreta and Hestrin 1998; Tsodyks and Markram 1997).
Synaptic depression was modeled by scaling the peak conductance of
a given synaptic channel by the size of the corresponding presynaptic
pool of synaptic “vesicles.” The dynamics of this pool was governed
by the simple first-order equation dP/dt ϭ Ϫspike ⅐ ␦P ⅐ P ϩ (Ppeak Ϫ
P)/␶P. The pool P decreases by the fraction ␦P for each spike ϭ 1. The
pool recovers its peak value Ppeak according to the time constant ␶P.

Intrinsic ion channel properties of thalamic and
cortical neurons
Ion channel currents that influence intrinsic firing properties of
thalamic and cortical neurons were modeled according to the
Hodgkin–Huxley formalism Iint ϭ gpeakmNh(V Ϫ Eint), where gpeak is
the maximal conductance for the channel, m and h determine the
activation and inactivation respectively (see following text), and Eint
is the reversal potential for the given channel. The factor N allows the
activation to occur on a different order than inactivation. The gating
of activation and inactivation follows the same first-order kinetics
equation: dx/dt ϭ [xϱ(V) Ϫ x]/␶x(V) where xϱ is the steady-state
activation/inactivation value for the channel.
PACEMAKER CURRENT IH. Ih is a noninactivating hyperpolarizationactivated cation current that is believed to underlie a depolarizing
“pacemaker” potential observed in many cells throughout the brain,
including the thalamus and the cortex (Huguenard and McCormick
1992; McCormick and Bal 1997; Robinson and Siegelbaum 2003).
The activation variable mh for Ih is modeled by mh ϭ 1/{1 ϩ
exp[(V Ϫ Vthreshold)/5.5]}, with Vthreshold ϭ Ϫ75.0. The rate ␶m of
activation and deactivation also follows Huguenard and McCormick
(1992): ␶m ϭ 1/[exp(Ϫ14.59 Ϫ 0.086V) ϩ exp(Ϫ1.87 ϩ 0.0701V)].

MODELING SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS

Only thalamic (Tp and Ts) and intrinsically bursting cells (IB: 30% of
excitatory cells in L5– 6) were endowed with Ih channels. The highest
density of Ih channels in cortex is expressed in the dendrites of layer
V neurons and was therefore included in L5– 6 neurons (Robinson and
Siegelbaum 2003).
IT is a low-threshold fastactivating calcium current that underlies the generation of bursts in the
thalamus and reticular nucleus (Huguenard and Prince 1992; McCormick and Bal 1997). We use the formulation of IT from previous
modeling work (Destexhe et al. 1996a; Huguenard and McCormick
1992). Using the steady-state activation formulae, the activation
variable is given by mϱ ϭ 1/{1 ϩ exp[Ϫ(V ϩ 59.0)/6.2]}, with the
voltage-dependent time constant ␶m ϭ {0.22/exp[Ϫ(V ϩ 132.0)/
16.7]} ϩ exp[(V ϩ 16.8)/18.2] ϩ 0.13. Inactivation of IT is defined as
hϱ ϭ 1/{1 ϩ exp[(V ϩ 83.0)/4.0]} with the inactivation time constant
␶h ϭ ͗8.2 ϩ {56.6 ϩ 0.27 exp[(V ϩ 115.2)/5.0]}͘/{1.0 ϩ exp[(V ϩ
86.0)/3.2]}. Only thalamic (Tp and Ts) and reticular (Rp and Rs) cells
incorporated IT channels. This current combined with Ih (described
above) endowed thalamic relay cells with intrinsic bursting properties.
Although some cortical neurons contain T-type currents (Pare´ and
Lang 1998), we did not include them in model cortical neurons for the
purpose of the present simulations. A slower T-current is known to
exist in reticular neurons (Destexhe et al. 1996b), but was not modeled
here, although it is not expected that this current would have a
significant impact on the present results.
LOW-THRESHOLD CALCIUM CURRENT IT.

PERSISTENT SODIUM CURRENT INA(P). This sodium current is found
in virtually all cortical neurons (French et al. 1990; Kay et al. 1998;
Mittmann and Alzheimer 1998; Stafstrom et al. 1984). It activates
quickly near the resting potential and is considered persistent because
it inactivates very slowly (on the order of seconds). We borrowed the
formulation for INa(p) from previous work (Compte et al. 2003;
Fleidervish et al. 1996). The steady-state values for activation are used
because they are considered to be instantaneous given their rapid time
course (Ͻ1 ms). The steady-state activation is mϱ(V) ϭ 1/[1 ϩ
exp(ϪV ϩ 55.7)/7.7]. We did not model the inactivation of this
current given its very slow time course. All cells in the model
contained INa(p).

A Naϩ- or
Ca2ϩ-activated Kϩ current appears to play an important role in the
termination of the depolarized phase of the slow oscillation (SanchezVives and McCormick 2000; Steriade et al. 2001). Both Naϩ and
Ca2ϩ currents are activated by the influx of ions that build up during
periods of depolarization or spiking. To reduce the computational
burden, we did not explicitly model either Ca2ϩ influx during spiking
or the intracellular Naϩ concentration. These concentrations increase
most when the membrane potential is elevated. Therefore we chose to
model this current as a generic activity-dependent potassium current
with some activation properties taken from models of IKNa (Wang and
Lambert 2003). To characterize this depolarization-dependent influx,
we use a sigmoid threshold function to determine how much the
measure of depolarization D should increase for the current membrane
potential. The factor D accumulates with depolarization and decays to
the internal equilibrium concentration according to dD/dt ϭ Dinflux Ϫ
D ⅐ (1 Ϫ Deq)/␶D where Dinflux ϭ 1/{1 ϩ exp[Ϫ(V Ϫ D␪)/␴D]}. The
voltage-dependent influx Dinflux is determined by a sigmoid function
with a threshold D␪ ϭ Ϫ10 mV and slope ␴D ϭ 5.0. The equilibrium
level for the depolarization-dependent value is Deq ϭ 0.001, and ␶D ϭ
1.25 s is the time constant that determines the return to Deq. The
depolarization-dependent activation of the current IDK is given by
mϱ ϭ 1/1 ϩ (d1/2D)3.5. The parameter d1/2 ϭ 0.25 determines the
level of D necessary for half activation. All cortical (L5– 6, L4, and
L2–3; excitatory and inhibitory) cells contained IDK channels.

INFLUENCE OF DIFFUSE NEUROMODULATORY SYSTEMS. Under
physiological conditions, ascending neuromodulatory projections

J Neurophysiol • VOL

1679

modulate the mode of firing in the thalamocortical system. Ascending
neuromodulatory projections from several brain stem nuclei and the
basal forebrain activate muscarinic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic,
histaminergic, and glutamate metabotropic receptors, which modulate
various cellular conductances that influence the overall level of
depolarization on which the sleep–wake cycle critically depends
(McCormick 1992). As will be specified in the RESULTS, the various
actions of neuromodulators are modeled as simultaneous changes of
the conductances for IKL, Ih, IDK, INa(p), and AMPA synapses of the
cortex, thalamus, and reticular nucleus.
The
primary source of noise in the model was random spontaneous optic
tract firing (45 spikes/s) modeled as 1,600 separate Poisson processes,
which were independent of the behavioral state (Mukhametov et al.
1970). The simulated optic nerve cells connect to Tp by diffuse
projections with independent Gaussian latencies on each connection.
This decreases the degree of synchronicity of spontaneous input and
produces the slightly overlapping receptive fields observed in the
LGN (Kara and Reid 2003). This random activity percolated throughout the network, producing irregular spontaneous activity in all layers
of the model.
In addition, we modeled “minis,” the spontaneous release of neurotransmitter quanta (Vautrin and Barker 2003), as low-amplitude
PSPs (mean ϭ 0.5 Ϯ 0.25 mV) consistent with experimental observations (Timofeev et al. 2000). The mean frequency of these Poisson
distributed synaptic minis was set to 2 Hz (total for an individual cell).

SPONTANEOUS ACTIVITY: OPTIC NERVE FIRING AND MINIS.

Data recording
All state variables of the network (Vm, intrinsic and synaptic
conductances and currents) were recorded during each simulation.
These recordings were then used to visualize the model activity in a
way that allowed comparison with experimental data—including local
field potentials, optical dye recordings, and intrinsic and synaptic
channel conductances.
The local field potential (LFP) as recorded in vivo is thought to be
primarily a reflection of the net synaptic activity (i.e., not the mean
firing rate) within a local region (several millimeters) around the
measuring electrode (Logothetis et al. 2001). A signal meant to
resemble the local field potential was calculated as a spatial average of
membrane potentials, LFP ϭ 1 Ϫ 1/N N V i, for all cells i within

͸

iϭ1

a given radius (unless otherwise specified, the radius ϭ 20 units ϭ the
area of an entire model layer).
Voltage-sensitive optical dye recordings provide a technique to
visualize spatiotemporal activity patterns in large-scale populations on
a rapid timescale (about 10 ms) (Fitzpatrick 2000). Accordingly, we
visualized large-scale activity patterns by displaying average membrane potential (10 ms) while preserving topographic relationships
between neurons.
Conductances of individual channels can be measured experimentally using patch-clamp techniques. In the model, all conductances are
explicitly calculated, and therefore easily recorded under all conditions.

Simulation techniques
SYNTHESIS. All simulations were performed using a general-purpose object-oriented interactive neural simulator called Synthesis
written by S. Hill (www.infinitedegrees.info). Synthesis provides a
complete simulation environment, including: a computation server
capable of parallel and distributed computation, a graphical userinterface for interactive visualization and manipulation, a scripting
language for automating parameter searches and experiments, an
interactive command-line environment for controlling the simulation,
data agents for data gathering and analysis, and a library of standard

neuron, synapse, and connection pattern models. The simulation
server is multithreaded for multiprocessor computation and capable of
distributing a simulation across multiple networked computers. Synthesis allows the user to interact fully with a simulation, visualizing
and recording all variables—at different levels and timescales—while
observing all network interactions and controlling all parameters in
real time throughout the course of a simulation.
NUMERICAL METHODS. Differential equations were numerically integrated using the Runge–Kutta 4th-order method (Press et al. 1992)
with a step size of 0.25 ms. The model was tested at smaller time steps
with no significant differences observed. The generation of optic
nerve activity and probabilistic connectivity patterns were based on
standard pseudorandom number generator routines (Press et al. 1992).
Analysis of the simulation data was carried out using standard toolboxes in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA).
COMPUTATIONAL TIME. The simulations were carried out on dualprocessor 2.0 Ghz Power Macintosh G5 machines running Mac OS
10.3 and equipped with 3.5 GB RAM (Apple, Cupertino, CA). Each
simulation of the full model used approximately 1.7 GB RAM.
Computational performance varied with the mean firing rate and
ranged from 500 to 700 ms/h for the full model. A single simulation
run of 3 s in duration required over 5 h to compute.
RESULTS

The overall organization of the model thalamocortical system is shown in Fig. 1. We chose to model the thalamocortical
system of the cat because most intracellular recordings during
the slow oscillation have been obtained from this system
(Steriade 2003). The full model contains 65,400 spiking neurons with 4,860,450 connections organized in regions and
pathways, consisting of a primary and a secondary area of
visual cortex (Vp and Vs), 2 corresponding regions of the
dorsal thalamus (Tp and Ts), and 2 regions of the reticular
thalamic nucleus (Rp and Rs). Vp represents a restricted
portion of area 17 in the cat (i.e., about 1 cm2) and it contains
units with small receptive fields that are selective for oriented
segments. Versus represents a corresponding part of an extrastriate area with coarser topography, containing units with
larger receptive fields that are selective for oriented lines and
for line crossings. Tp and Ts correspond to a portion of the
lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and to a portion of the lateral
posterior pulvinar complex (LP), respectively. The thalamocortical model builds on a previously published architecture
that was used to explore properties of synchrony and spike
timing in response to visual stimuli and that successfully
reproduced several experimental results (Lumer et al. 1997a,b).
A central feature of the model is the subdivision of the
simulated cortex into 3 layers with different patterns of afferent, efferent, and local connectivity corresponding to supragranular layers, infragranular layers, and layer 4 (Figs. 1 and
2). Another key feature is the detailed simulation of horizontal
intralaminar connections, vertical interlaminar connections
within Vp and Vs, forward and backward connections between
Vp and Vs, thalamocortical and corticothalamic connections,
and connections from thalamic relay nuclei and cortex to the
nucleus reticularis. We believe all these features constitute the
minimum necessary components of a prototypical thalamocortical system.
Individual cortical and thalamic neurons, both excitatory and
inhibitory, were modeled as single-compartment integrate-andfire units using cellular constants from regular- and fast-spiking
J Neurophysiol • VOL

neurons, respectively (Connors et al. 1982). Intrinsic currents
were modeled using details of intracellular channel dynamics
including those regulating hyperpolarizarion-activated cations
Ih, low-threshold calcium IT, persistent sodium INa(p), potassium leak IKL, and a depolarization-dependent potassium current IDK. Synaptic interactions occurred through simulated
channels that provided voltage-dependent (NMDA-like) and
voltage-independent (AMPA-like) excitation, as well as fast
(GABAA-like) and slow (GABAB-like) inhibition. All connections were endowed with conduction delays. Finally, neuromodulatory influences, such as those attributed to acetylcholine, were modeled as diffuse changes of intrinsic and synaptic
conductances.
In what follows, we first show that our large-scale model of
the thalamocortical system reproduces various aspects of spontaneous activity during wakefulness including low-voltage fast
activity in the EEG, irregular firing, correlated subthreshold
activity that reflects the functional architecture, and selective
response to stimuli including gamma frequency synchronization in the evoked response. We then show that the model
transitions to slow-wave sleep primarily arise from an increase
in the potassium leak (IKL) current. The slow oscillation that
subsequently emerges has many properties that are consistent
with experimental results including a bimodal membrane potential distribution, a disfacilitated and silent down-state and a
depolarized, high-conductance up-state that exhibits gamma
frequency synchronization and mean firing rates in the range of
10 –20 Hz. By performing several manipulations on the key
model parameters, we investigate which intrinsic and synaptic
currents underlie the initiation, maintenance, and termination
of the slow oscillation. Finally, we demonstrate that the synchronization of the slow oscillation in the model is dependent
on corticocortical connections, consistent with experimental
observations.
The robustness of the results presented here was tested by
replicating the experiments described below while systematically varying the relevant parameters as well as by starting
from different initial conditions (the precise location of connections are generated probabilistically; see METHODS). For all
simulation results described below, small perturbations in parameter values did not significantly alter the results (actual
results of robustness tests are not shown because of the extremely large size of parameter space explored, amounting to
more than 3 years of CPU time).
In the waking mode, the model exhibits spontaneous activity
throughout the cortex and shows selective responses to
visual stimuli
In the waking mode, spontaneous activity originating in
retinothalamic afferents spreads throughout the thalamocortical system (Fig. 3, A–D, left). When a visual stimulus is
applied, a selective response emerges from the spontaneous
activity and high-frequency firing occurs for the duration of the
stimulus (Fig. 3, A–D, right).
Figure 3A depicts the spatiotemporal organization of the
membrane potential for 25 neurons for each of the 3 layers of
Vp and the corresponding sectors of Tp and Rp. During the
spontaneous condition (Fig. 3A, left), the membrane potential
rapidly fluctuates around approximately 60 mV. The cells are
rarely hyperpolarized below Ϫ70 mV. Occasionally, neurons

in all layers. L4 is slightly more depolarized than other cortical
layers because of the high level of synaptic input from Tp.

responses consist of marked inhibition and decreased firing,
while the network reconfigures and resumes generating spontaneous activity after a few dozen milliseconds.
Intracellular unit recordings (Fig. 3B) depict spontaneous
and evoked activity comparable to intracellular recording in
vivo. Specifically, cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons
fire irregularly at low rates (2–10 Hz) during spontaneous
activity, while firing at elevated rates (20 –100 Hz) during
stimulation, consistent with experimental data (Azouz and
Gray 1999). In these traces, the evoked activity appears to end
prematurely because the stimulus is a slowly drifting grating
and therefore does not rest within the receptive field of the
individual cells shown for the entire time period.
The LFP (see METHODS), reflecting spontaneous and evoked
activity, shows low-voltage fast-activity patterns in the absence
of stimuli (Fig. 3C, left) and clear evoked responses with
high-frequency oscillations during stimulus presentation (Fig.
3C, right), consistent with LFPs recorded in vivo during
stimulation (Gray and Singer 1989).
The topographic displays (Fig. 3D) show time-averaged (10
ms) membrane potentials in L2–3. Spontaneous activity in the
model has a subthreshold correlational structure that reflects
the orientation preference of the neural population (Fig. 3D,
left). Specifically, subthreshold vertical and horizontal bars of
depolarization are visible in the average membrane potential
for each selective population even when no stimulus is applied.
The spontaneous emergence of correlated activity reflects the
underlying orientation-selective mechanisms, consistent with
optical dye recordings in the monkey showing that cellular
membrane potential fluctuations during spontaneous activity
reflect the functional architecture and selective response mechanisms of visual cortex (Kenet et al. 2003; Tsodyks et al.
1999). When a vertical grating is presented, vertically selective
cells respond preferentially, whereas cells selective for horizontal features remain virtually silent, as is evident in Fig. 3D
(right). A movie of the topographic view of several layers
throughout the model network during both spontaneous activity and during stimulus presentation is available (see supplementary video #11).
An increase in potassium leak conductance triggers the
transition from the waking mode to the sleep mode
In the model, the transition from the waking mode to the
sleep mode (Fig. 4) comes about primarily by increasing the
potassium leak conductance gKL (from 1.0 to 1.85), which is
present in all model neurons. This corresponds to the unblocking of background potassium leak channels arising from the

reduced actions during sleep of neuromodulators such as acetylcholine (McCormick 1992). Without this single change of
gKL, the network does not enter the hyperpolarized, silent state
necessary for the sleep mode. A number of other network
parameters are modulated during the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Several studies suggest that muscarinic receptor
activation can significantly inhibit the INa(p) conductance (Mittmann and Alzheimer 1998). The removal of acetylcholine
would therefore cause an effective increase in the conductance
of INa(p) throughout the network. We model this by increasing
the conductance gNa(p) for the sleep mode (from 0.5 to 1.25).
Acetylcholine has also been shown to shift the activation curve
of Ih to more depolarized levels (McCormick et al. 1993). We
model this by increasing the conductance of Ih during the sleep
mode (from 1.0 to 2.0). IT is also known to be inhibited by
activation of muscarinic receptors (McCormick 1992). We
model this by increasing the peak conductance of IT from
wakefulness to sleep (from 1.0 to 1.25). Neither of the changes
to Ih or IT played a significant role in the transition to sleep.
The removal of acetylcholine and norepinephrine unblocks
slow potassium currents (McCormick 1992), which are represented in the model by the depolarization-activated potassium
current IDK. We increased gDK (from 0.5 to 1.25) in parallel
with gKL. Finally, muscarinic receptor activation reduces intracortical EPSPs (Gil et al. 1997), suggesting that— during
wakefulness— excitatory synapses are depressed relative to
slow-wave sleep. We model this change by increasing the
amplitude of AMPA EPSPs (by 50%) from the waking mode
to the sleep mode.
Membrane potential rasters for a population of neighboring
cells from throughout both Vp and Versus of the network
illustrate the result of this modulation (Fig. 4A). Spontaneous
activity during the waking mode gradually diminishes and the
entire network enters a silent down-state by the time gKL has
reached its maximum. After several hundred milliseconds of
silence, the network begins to depolarize as a result of the
activation of INa(p) and rapidly enters an up-state with depolarized membrane potential, elevated firing, and apparent synchronization throughout the network. In the sleep mode, the
thalamus is quieted, although it becomes periodically depolarized, producing short spike bursts in response to cortical
depolarization. Vp and Versus fall in and out of phase initially,
but gradually become and remain synchronized. Intracellular
activity in Versus is similar to that shown in Vp, although it
tends to have less noisy down-states because of the lack of
optic nerve input.
Figure 4B shows the same transition from the irregular firing
of the waking mode to the sleep mode in 2 neighboring
excitatory and inhibitory cells in L2–3 as well as single cells in
the model thalamus and reticular nucleus. It is evident that the

network becomes hyperpolarized as gKL increases and the network becomes silent. After several hundred milliseconds, individual cells become depolarized and
fire for several hundred milliseconds, during which the entire cortical network becomes strongly engaged in the up-state. LFP reflects the synchronization of the
network activity showing the transition from low-voltage fast activity to high-amplitude slow activity. Notice the increased level of activity during the up-state
compared with the down-state as well as to the waking mode.

As revealed by the LFP (Fig. 4C), when the network transitions from the waking mode to the sleep mode, the population
activity changes from irregular activity (low-voltage fast activity) to a synchronized oscillation that continues indefinitely
(high-voltage slow activity).
Figure 4D depicts a topographic map of average membrane
potentials (10 ms) from L2–3 during periods of the waking
mode and during up- and down-states during the sleep mode.
The topographic map during waking (Fig. 4D, left) is similar to
that shown in Fig. 3D. The 2 topographical maps taken from
the sleep mode illustrate the dramatic difference between upand down-states. The up-state is clearly more depolarized than
the down-state and neurons are intensely active. During the
down state, neurons are hyperpolarized and virtually silent
(Fig. 4D, right). The rapid development of this synchronization
in the network is consistent with observations of the transition
from wakefulness to natural sleep in cats (Steriade et al. 2001).
A movie of the topographic view of several layers throughout
the model starting from the waking mode and showing the
transition to the sleep mode is available (see supplementary
video #2).
Additional simulations (not shown) reveal that when the
network is transitioned more gradually from the waking mode
to the sleep mode, and when the parameters influenced by
neuromodulators are at an intermediate level, it exhibits sleep
spindles. Spindle activity will be the object of a future publication and will not be discussed here.
In the sleep mode, the model displays a stable slow
oscillation consisting of an up-state and a down-state
In the sleep mode, the network oscillates between a depolarized and hyperpolarized phase in a synchronized fashion
(Fig. 5). The depolarized “up-state” lasts about 300 – 600 ms
and is characterized by an average membrane potential of
around Ϫ58 mV, elevated firing rates, and elevated intrinsic
and synaptic currents. The hyperpolarized “down-state” lasts
between 400 and 600 ms and is characterized by an average
membrane potential of around Ϫ75 mV, an absence of firing,
and very low intrinsic and synaptic currents. The LFP (Fig. 5,
top) depicts the population level synchronization. Membrane
potential rasters depict activity for each layer showing the
synchronization of the up- and down-states across all layers
and all neurons of the model cortex (Fig. 5, rasters). The
network produces regular alternations between up- and downstates at about 1 Hz. Intracellular traces reflect the irregularity
and variety of up- and down-states typical of the slow oscillation (Fig. 5, A–C, intracellular traces).
If the transition from the waking mode to the sleep mode is
more gradual, the slow oscillations produced by the network
occur at more irregular intervals and are less tightly synchronous (not shown). Regions of the network initiate the up-state
of the oscillation and gradually recruit the rest of the network
after several cycles. In general, the synchronization of the
oscillation is very dynamic, with each new cycle dependent on
the activity during the previous oscillation. For instance, when
an up-state spontaneously produces high firing rates across the
network, several subsequent cycles are increasingly synchronized. As the system relaxes, the next cycles of the oscillation
become less tightly synchronized. The duration of the up- and
down-states under such circumstances are more variable,

closely resembling the intracellular traces recorded during
natural sleep (Steriade et al. 2001). For the purposes of this
paper we have focused on the prototypical slow oscillation
with clearly defined up- and down-states similar to those
recorded during deeper stages of natural sleep (Amzica and
Steriade 1998) or under ketamine–xylazine anesthesia (Steriade et al. 1993).
The slow oscillation propagates through intra- and
interareal connections
The model slow oscillation propagates at different spatial
and temporal scales. First, small local clusters of activity
propagate like traveling waves slowly within Vp (see supplementary materials, movie 2). The propagation of this activity
wave has a definite origination point and propagation direction
with a speed of approximately 0.01 m/s, which is comparable
to the speed measured in cortical slices (Petersen et al. 2003;
Sanchez-Vives and McCormick 2000). This is a reflection of
the propagation of activity largely through local interlaminar
connections. Second, the activity propagated rapidly across the
entire cortical area Vp, attributed to the accelerated spread of
multiple clusters of activity mediated largely through intralaminar horizontal connections. These connections cause the
depolarization of the up-state to propagate throughout Vp with
an estimated speed of about 1.6 – 4.0 m/s. The propagation of
the slow oscillation and the observed range of speeds are
compatible with experimental data measured in human EEG
showing that the slow oscillation is a traveling-wave phenomenon (Massimini et al. 2004). Finally, propagation occurs
between cortical areas Vp and Versus (not shown), although it
is not possible to estimate the corresponding propagation speed
from the model. The precise origination site and propagation
path is variable between each cycle and the next.
Intrinsic and synaptic currents underlie the alternation
between up- and down-states
The 3 primary active intrinsic currents underlying the upand down-state in L5– 6IB neurons are Ih, IDK, and INa(p) (Fig.
5D). These currents fluctuate and reflect the different stages of
the slow oscillation, with INa(p) and IDK making the strongest
contribution to the membrane potential. The primary depolarizing intrinsic factor is a voltage-dependent sodium current
INa(p). The half point activation for INa(p) was set to Ϫ55.0 mV,
but the conductance begins to increase slightly at voltages as
low as Ϫ80 mV. Although the current is very small at this
voltage, it has an accumulative and amplifying effect as it is
integrated into the membrane potential, gradually increasing
and pushing the cell to a persistent depolarized state. The
primary hyperpolarizing intrinsic factor is the depolarizationactivated potassium current IDK. Because this current is activity
dependent, the amount of depolarization and spiking influence
the strength of IDK, thus determining the degree of hyperpolarization. With an increased firing rate, IDK increases significantly. Similarly, with low levels of depolarization or spiking,
the IDK current remains weak. INa(p) and IDK tend to covary
balancing each other during the up-state. The hyperpolarization-activated current Ih becomes active during the down-state
and slowly activates, providing a small depolarizing current.
Model neurons in other cortical layers lack Ih, although they

of about 0.9 –1.1 Hz. Network maintains a stable regimen of alternating up- and down-states throughout the cortical circuitry. LFP (A, top) reflects the
synchronization of all neurons throughout the cortical model. Membrane potential rasters for 100 neurons selected from each layer (A: L2–3, B: L4; and C: L5– 6)

including some without any spikes at all (*, as observed in vivo). Small depolarizations seen in some traces (L4 and L5– 6) during the down-state reflect synaptic
input that continues to arrive from Tp. Individual synaptic (D) and intrinsic (E) current traces show the component currents of the membrane potential for the
selected cell in L5– 6. Note the activation of excitatory ␣-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and inhibitory ␥-aminobutyric acid-A
(GABAA) synaptic currents during the up-state. Note also the activation of INa(p) and IDK intrinsic currents during the up-state and the very low activation of
all currents during the down-state.

contain the remaining intrinsic currents and similar activity
profiles.
Figure 5E shows the primary categories of synaptic input:
the excitatory currents AMPA, NMDA and the inhibitory
currents GABAA and GABAB. AMPA and GABAA dominate
during the up-state and they tend to maintain a balance with
each other. Note that NMDA occurs independently of these 2
during the up-state and plays a significant depolarizing role
during periods of strong activation. GABAB is rarely active
during the up-state, although it can become active during
seizurelike activity (see following text). During the down-state,
large EPSPs (reflecting synaptic input from the thalamus) and
the low-amplitude synaptic minis (representing synaptic quantal release) are visible in L5– 6 synaptic current traces (especially AMPA). Throughout the up-state synaptic currents are
held in check by synaptic depression, an activity-dependent
decrease in synaptic strength that depends on presynaptic firing
rates.
The distribution of the membrane potential changes between
the waking and sleep modes
Spontaneous activity patterns in individual neurons show
dramatically different distributions between the waking mode
and the sleep mode. In the waking mode, the membrane
potential of model neurons throughout the model cortex fluctuates near firing threshold and the cells spike irregularly (Fig.
6A). The histogram of the membrane potential of a representative neuron shows an even distribution around the mean of
Ϫ60 mV, consistent with in vivo intracellular recordings in
cats (Steriade et al. 2001). During the sleep mode, by contrast,
each cell changes activity patterns and alternates between
depolarized (Ϫ60 mV) and hyperpolarized (Ϫ80 mV) phases
(Fig. 6B). The membrane potential distribution becomes strikingly bimodal, illustrating the bistable nature of the network
during the slow oscillation. The bimodal distribution of the
membrane potentials is consistent with data recorded during
natural sleep in vivo (Steriade et al. 2001). Because of the long
duration of the down-states the peak of the distribution during
the hyperpolarized phase is larger than that observed in vivo.
This is to be expected because of the small portion of cortex
being modeled. In vivo, the frequency of the up-states increases and the duration of down-states decreases with the size
of the intact preparation (Timofeev et al. 2000).
Spontaneous firing rates vary throughout the layers of the
model and change between the waking and sleep modes
In the waking mode, model neurons exhibit average spontaneous firing rates that vary throughout the layers of the
network (Fig. 6C, left). L4, the primary input layer, has the
highest firing rate in the cortex (10 Ϯ 8.5 spikes/s). L5– 6,
which receives slightly less dense projections from the thala-

mus, has a lower activity rate (9 Ϯ 9.3 spikes/s). L2–3, the
superficial layer, is more quiet, with a mean firing rate of
approximately 6 Ϯ 5.8 spikes/s. This distribution of firing rates
in the model is consistent with in vivo recordings from V1 of
alert monkeys, although the model exhibits slightly higher
firing rates in the supragranular layer (6 Ϯ 5.8 vs. 2–3 spikes/s)
(Snodderly and Gur 1995) (to our knowledge, data are not
available for the cat). In the sleep mode (Fig. 6C, right), the
mean rate and laminar distribution of neural firing change
slightly. Neurons in L2–3 increase their firing rate, whereas the
firing rate for L4 excitatory neurons decreases. A slight increase is also seen in the firing rate for excitatory neurons in
L5– 6. Figure 6C shows the distribution of firing rates during
the up- and down-state of the sleep mode. L2–3 shows the
highest firing rate (25 Ϯ 10.1 spikes/s). L4 is the least active
cortical population firing at 11 Ϯ 8.2 spikes/s. L5– 6 fires at
elevated rates comparable to L2–3 (22 Ϯ 9.3 spikes/s). Overall,
firing rates are elevated above the level seen during waking
(10 –25 Hz) during the up-state, whereas the network is strikingly inactive and firing rates are essentially zero during the
down-state. This is consistent with experimental observations
of the firing rate during the slow oscillation in vivo (Steriade et
al. 1993). The most active populations during the up-state are
L2–3 and L5– 6, reflecting the dominance of corticortical input
during the sleep mode, in contrast to the dominance of
thalamocortical input during the waking mode.
Activated states give rise to gamma frequency activity in the
waking and sleep modes
Figure 6D shows that high-frequency fluctuations occur
during both the waking and sleep modes. In the waking mode,
bursts of activity are seen both when a stimulus is applied and
during spontaneous ongoing activity. This activity consists of
synchronized fluctuations in membrane potential and spike
discharges across entire neural populations. In the sleep mode,
high-frequency fluctuations in the LFP are present during the
up-state of the slow oscillation. This is consistent with the
description of the generation of gamma frequency activity
during activated states in both wakefulness and sleep in vivo
(Steriade 2000). Figure 6D (bar plot) compares the total power
in the ␥ range of 35–58 Hz (during 4-s epochs) in the waking
and sleep modes. Consistent with recent studies in humans
(Cantero et al. 2004), there is much less gamma activity during
the up-states of the slow oscillation of the sleep mode than
there is in the waking mode (n ϭ 10 epochs; P Ͻ 0.0001,
t-test).
Gamma frequency oscillations are generated in the model
during depolarized states. As indicated by further simulations,
a key parameter governing the generation of gamma is the
kinetics of GABAA receptors. Strong depolarization and activation of excitatory neurons causes a strong activation of

GABAA channels that serve to pace excitatory firing in a
synchronized oscillation. Specifically, the rise time of the
GABAA postsynaptic potential determines the frequency of
gamma-range oscillations during the presentation of a stimulus
or during the depolarized phase of the sleep mode (data not
shown). The role of GABAA in the model during waking is
consistent with both physiological and theoretical studies
(Traub et al. 2003; Whittington et al. 2000). The network
interactions governing the emergence of this rhythm have been
explored in an earlier paper (Lumer et al. 1997b).
Cellular conductances change with activity mode and
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents are balanced in
both the waking and sleep modes
During the waking mode, the average cellular conductance
for excitatory cells (n ϭ 1,600; L2–3 cells, summed intrinsic
and synaptic conductances) is steady at a moderate level,
whereas in the sleep mode the conductances alternate between
high and low levels reflecting the up- and down-states of the
slow oscillation (Fig. 6E). The conductances during the upstate of the sleep mode are nearly twice that of waking,
whereas the conductances at the beginning of the down-state
are extremely low. These values are consistent with measurements made in vivo showing that the input resistance (conductanceϪ1) during the up-state is significantly lower than that of
wakefulness (Contreras et al. 1996; Steriade 2003; Steriade et
al. 2001). Figure 6F shows the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents on a model pyramidal cell during both an up- and
down-state. Excitatory and inhibitory currents balance each
other throughout the slow oscillation. This is consistent with
previous theoretical studies concerning the role of excitation
and inhibition during activated states (van Vreeswijk and
Sompolinsky 1996).
Firing intervals during activated states are highly irregular
We computed the coefficient of variation (CV) of the interspike interval (ISI) for spike trains recorded throughout the
model cortex during both the waking mode and the up-state of
the sleep mode (not shown). The variability was high (CV Ն1)
for most model neurons during wakefulness with a mean of
CV ϭ 1.26; n ϭ 4,800. During the up-state, the variability was
similarly high (CV ϭ 1.41; n ϭ 4,800). The slight increase in the
CV during sleep may be a reflection of the increased “burstiness”
of IB cells in L5– 6 attributed to the hyperpolarized state. This
variability during both the waking mode and the up-state is
consistent with experimental observations. Recent work in vitro
has shown that the ISI of regular spiking neurons during up-states
is highly variable (CV ϭ 1.74; n ϭ 6) (Shu et al. 2003). Neurons
recorded in vivo from the primary visual and extrastriate cortices
of the awake behaving macaque monkey also exhibit highly
variable ISIs (Softky and Koch 1993). Indeed, variable firing
patterns occur in vivo under numerous conditions and appear to be

characteristic of high-conductance states (Destexhe et al. 2003;
Shadlen and Newsome 1998).
Persistent sodium currents (INa(p)), hyperpolarizationactivated cation currents (Ih), and synaptic activity in
cortical cells initiate the up-state
To identify the key players involved in the initiation, maintenance, and termination of the slow oscillation, we performed
a number of parameter manipulations on the network in the
sleep mode. We used as a control condition a 1.5-s window of
the slow oscillation starting from exactly the same initial
conditions for each manipulation, including the same random
number generator seed. In the absence of any manipulation, the
network exactly reproduces the control condition every time it
is simulated starting from these initial conditions. Therefore
until the point at which a parameter is manipulated, the activity
at all levels in the network is identical. This allows us to
examine the effect of the key parameters on network activity in
a precise and reproducible manner.
As shown in Fig. 7A, INa(p), Ih, synaptic minis, and thalamocortical EPSPs all provide depolarizing input to cortical neurons (L5– 6 and L4), causing them to start firing and leading to
a cascade of synaptic activity which initiates the slow oscillation throughout the network.
Figure 7B shows the important role of the potassium leak
current in the transition from the waking mode to the sleep
mode. The model starts from the same initial conditions as the
control condition, but with the potassium conductance set to
waking levels (gKL ϭ 1.0). The activity produced in this
condition strongly resembles the up-state but without any
down-state interrupting the periods of depolarization. The
bistability between up- and down-states in the network is lost.
Blocking INa(p) prevents any activity from developing (Fig.
7C). Synaptic minis and thalamocortical EPSPs are unable to
cause a cell to become sufficiently depolarized and fire. Lacking INa(p), neurons are incapable of reaching firing threshold
and initiating the up-state and they remain hyperpolarized at
about Ϫ80 mV. This is consistent with the finding that spontaneous up-states in cortical slice preparations are completely
abolished when INa(p) is blocked (Mao et al. 2001).
Under control conditions, the cells in L5– 6 endowed with Ih
are more depolarized and therefore to tend to be the first to fire.
When Ih is blocked, the onset of the slow oscillation is delayed
by over 100 ms (Fig. 7D). This increased duration of the
down-state persists after several cycles, thus reducing the
frequency of the slow oscillation (not shown). This slowing
effect is consistent with experimental studies showing that the
frequency of up-states is reduced when Ih blockers are applied
(Mao et al. 2001). The model behavior is also consistent with
the observation that infragranular layers tend to be more
depolarized and in slice preparations, the slow oscillation
originates from cells in these layers (Sanchez-Vives and McCormick 2000).

from the removal of this depolarizing input.

The removal of the thalamus, which provides excitatory
input to both L5– 6 and L4, causes a slight hyperpolarization in
L5– 6 (Fig. 7E) and L4 (not shown) membrane potentials,
slowing the initiation of the slow oscillation by about 250 ms.
Nonetheless, the slow oscillation still emerges and intrinsic and
synaptic activity resembles the control condition (Fig. 7A).
This demonstrates that the initiation of the slow oscillation in
the model is purely cortical, consistent with experimental
observations (Mao et al. 2001; Sanchez-Vives and McCormick
2000; Timofeev et al. 2000).
In summary, according to the present simulations, the key to
initiating an up-state is the activation of INa(p) consistent with
experimental observations (Timofeev et al 2000). This can be
accomplished using a variety of means, including spontaneous
quantal release “minis,” synaptic input from other cortical and
thalamic areas, or intrinsic hyperpolarization-activated Ih currents. The experimental evidence for the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of the up-state points to both intrinsic
and synaptic mechanisms. Compte et al. (2003) suggested that
neurons within the cortex are spontaneously active and the
coincident activation of a sufficient number of neurons triggers
the up-state. The spontaneous activity in infragranular cells is
attributed to intrinsic conductances present in these cells (Mao
et al. 2001; Sanchez-Vives and McCormick 2000). Infragranular IB cortical cells contain intrinsic conductances, such as Ih,
INa(p), and IKCa, which are responsible for intrinsic bursting
properties (Franceschetti et al. 1995; Silva et al. 1991). Of
these, INa(p) appears to be the most important in generating
intrinsic bursts (Franceschetti et al. 1995). Moreover, blocking
Ih and INa(p) abolishes spontaneous activity in cortical slice
preparations (Mao et al. 2001).
Both intrinsic and synaptic currents maintain the up-state
During the up-state, a number of currents—synaptic and
intrinsic—are active (Fig. 8A). Note that AMPA, NMDA, and
GABAA are all active during the up-state. Also note the
activation of intrinsic depolarizing [INa(p)] and hyperpolarizing
(IDK) currents.
Blocking all intracortical AMPA currents causes a failure in
the up-state (Fig. 8B) and terminates the slow oscillation,
although there continues to be spontaneous activity in L5– 6
arising from intrinsic currents. This is consistent with experimental evidence showing a termination of the slow oscillation
when non-NMDA glutamatergic channels are blocked, yet
spontaneous activity persists in infragranular cells (SanchezVives and McCormick 2000).
In Fig. 8C, blocking NMDA leads to a disruption of the
up-state. The depolarizing influence of NMDA plays an important role in determining the duration of the up-state. A
mixture of AMPA and INa(p) causes sporadic depolarizations
but network activity is strikingly desynchronized and fails to
exhibit a network-wide synchronized up-state. This is consistent with experimental data showing that blocking NMDA can
interfere with the generation of the slow oscillation and causes

greatly shortened up-states in individual cells (Steriade et al.
1993).
When GABAA is blocked during the up-state (Fig. 8D), a
high burst of activity is produced, followed by a rapid, synchronous termination of the depolarized phase. With the removal of this inhibition, AMPA and NMDA dominate, inducing a high-frequency burst until the inhibitory IDK current
overwhelms it. This suggests that GABAA plays a crucial role
in maintaining the balance of excitation and inhibition during
the up-state. During this intense burst of activity, GABAB
receptors also become highly activated (Fig. 8D, synaptic
currents). GABAB is usually minimally active during the
up-state and the waking mode, but during this seizurelike
activity, it plays a significant role in limiting the runaway
excitation.
Blocking INa(p) (Fig. 8E) during an up-state immediately
terminates the depolarized phase. The network rapidly becomes hyperpolarized, suggesting that INa(p) is critical not only
for initiating the up-state (as described above) but also for its
maintenance.
Depolarization-activated potassium currents (IDK) and
synaptic depression terminate the up-state
Intrinsic and synaptic factors are both involved in the termination of the up-state. The primary factor is the hyperpolarizing depolarization-activated potassium current IDK, which is
activated during the up-state (Fig. 9A). Because the strongest
influx of calcium and sodium occurs during a spike, IDK
increases most rapidly during periods of firing. This means that
periods of rapid firing substantially contribute to the termination of the up-state at the level of an individual cell. Figure 9B
shows the result of blocking IDK in the midst of an up-state.
The duration of the up-state is lengthened by several hundred
milliseconds and the down-state is shorter compared with the
control condition. The model activity also becomes desynchronized with the removal of IDK. The frequency of the oscillation
increases to 2– 4 Hz. This increase in the oscillation frequency
is consistent with that observed in vitro after the application of
␤-adrenergic agents, which block slow AHPs in cortical neurons and replace the slow oscillation with a faster 2- to 3-Hz
rhythm (Brumberg et al. 2000).
Synaptic depression, which reduces the amount of synaptic
current based on recent presynaptic activity (see METHODS), also
plays an important role in the termination of the up-state as
well as in the synchronization of the slow oscillation. Blocking
synaptic depression altogether causes some neurons to fail to
terminate the up-state and the network becomes more noisy
and desynchronized (Fig. 9C). In Fig. 9D, the rate of synaptic
depression is increased to 4-fold its normal level (used for
control and waking conditions). The amplitude of synaptic
currents is reduced and continues to decrease during the upstate. As a result, the up-state becomes significantly shorter
(about 1/3 less) than during the control oscillation (Fig. 9A).
The time to recover from synaptic depression also influences

FIG. 8. Intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms involved in the maintenance of the up-state. A: control condition. Notice the persistent activation of INa(p) and the
increased levels of AMPA, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and GABAA during the up-state. B: removing AMPA immediately terminates the up-state. Note that
intrinsic bursting remains in L5– 6 cells arising fromINa(p) and IDK. C: removing NMDA terminates the up-state. Note that the individual cells continue to produce
up- and down-states that are shorter and the network becomes desynchronized. D: removing GABAA causes high-intensity seizurelike bursts. Although
subsequent seizures are not visible because of the timescale, they do repeat at long intervals (about 1 s). E: removing INa(p) immediately silences the entire cortical
network. Red arrows indicate the time of the manipulation.

The mechanisms that determine the termination of the upstate are not clear from experimental data. Computational
studies have suggested that both potassium currents (Compte et
al. 2003) and synaptic depression (Bazhenov et al. 2002) are
important. Our model predicts that they each play an important
role. In the model, activity-dependent potassium currents are
essential not only for terminating the up-state, but also for
maintaining the balance of excitation and inhibition for its
duration. In addition, synaptic depression appears to be important in the termination of the up-state as well as in the overall
synchronization of the slow oscillation.

LFP reflects this synchronization and the alternation of activated and inactivated states is apparent in the intracellular
recording of a cell in L2–3. The slow oscillation is apparent in
all 3 layers of cortex. The autocorrelation shows the strong
periodicity of the slow oscillation at a frequency of about 1 Hz.
To test the dependency of this synchronized activity on corticocortical connections, we blocked 2 sets of connections. The
first is the set of horizontal intraareal excitatory connections,
which link neighboring neurons within the same cortical area.
The second is the set of long-range excitatory connections
connecting the 2 cortical areas (Vp and Vs).

Corticocortical connections influence the synchronization
and amplitude of the slow oscillation

Blocking all horizontal excitatory connections within the
primary cortical area Vp causes the network to rapidly desynchronize, although individual cells continue to produce both
up- and down-states (Fig. 10B). These connections are blocked
by setting the conductance for all AMPA and NMDA channels

In the control condition, the network is highly synchronized
and produces clearly defined slow oscillations (Fig. 10A). The

associated with horizontal connections within Vp or Versus to
zero. All vertical and interareal connections remain intact.
Notice the decrease in amplitude of the LFP as the network
becomes progressively desynchronized. Intracellular traces
show how the up-states of the slow oscillation are shortened as
a result of the lack of synchronizing input from neighboring
cells. The autocorrelation of the LFP shows that cutting intraareal connections dramatically reduces the normal strong
synchronization (Fig. 10D). In addition, the average hyperpolarization during the down-state (computed by averaging the
membrane potential across all down-states selected from 10 s
of sleep mode) is decreased by 63% of the control condition for
all cortical neurons. The role of intraareal connections in
maintaining and synchronizing the slow oscillation in the
model is consistent with experimental data recorded in vitro
and in vivo. Experiments in vitro show that activity is propagated and synchronized by horizontal cortical connections
(Sanchez-Vives and McCormick 2000). Furthermore, the frequency and regularity of depolarizing events in cortical slabs
has been linked to the size of their intact network, suggesting
that the frequency of the slow oscillation depends on the extent
of the corticocortical network (Timofeev et al. 2000).
Interareal connections
Blocking all interareal connections between Vp and Vs also
results in desynchronization, although less marked than that
after blocking intraareal connections (Fig. 10C). Blocking
these connections consists of setting the conductance of all
AMPA and NMDA channels for the connections between Vp
and Vs to zero. All intraareal connections remain intact. The
LFP continues to display a distinct rhythmicity but its amplitude is a greatly reduced. Intracellularly, cells continue to
produce the slow oscillation, although the up-state is shortened
and down-states become noisier as they reflect the activity of
other neurons in the network. Membrane potential rasters show
how Vp remains rhythmic but is not entrained in a tight slow
oscillation. The autocorrelation of the LFP illustrates the intermediate level of desynchronization arising from blocking
interareal connections (Fig. 10D). This intermediate desynchronization is also reflected in a 46% decrease in the average
hyperpolarization during the down-state. The results of these
manipulations are consistent with experimental data showing
that application of lidocaine to corticocortical connections can
cause cortical oscillations to become less synchronized
(Amzica and Steriade 1995a).
DISCUSSION

We have constructed a large-scale model of the visual
thalamocortical system that captures its physiological properties and anatomical organization at multiple levels: from the
level of intrinsic cellular currents and synaptic conductances to
that of the connectivity within and between cortical and thalamic areas. Our goal was to provide a coherent account, within
a single model, of the functioning of the thalamocortical
system in waking and sleep.
In the waking mode, the model reproduces experimental
observations from waking animals, including the spontaneous
irregular firing underlying EEG low-voltage fast activity, the
emergence of correlated subthreshold activity reflecting the
J Neurophysiol • VOL

functional organization of intracortical connections, the selective response of different neuronal populations to visual stimuli, and the gamma frequency synchronization in evoked responses. The results during waking are consistent with experimental work using intracellular (Azouz and Gray 1999;
Jagadeesh et al. 1992), extracellular (Alonso and Martinez
1998; Softky and Koch 1993), optical imaging (Arieli et al.
1995; Kenet et al. 2003; Tsodyks et al. 1999), and EEG
techniques (Gray and Singer 1989). The distribution of spontaneous firing rates across different cortical layers is also
consistent with experimental data (Snodderly and Gur 1995).
The present work builds on our previous model of orientation selectivity (Lumer et al. 1997b). Briefly, orientation selectivity in this model results from a conventional Hubel and
Wiesel arrangement of afferents from oriented patches in the
thalamus converging on individual cells in the model cortex
such that they define horizontal and vertical receptive fields.
Several other computational models have explored the genesis
of orientation and directional selectivity (Douglas et al. 1995;
McLaughlin et al. 2000; Miller 1994; Somers et al. 1995;
Wimbauer et al. 1997a,b; Worgotter and Koch 1991). Although the specific mechanisms yielding orientation selectivity
are not the focus of the present paper, it should be emphasized
that this model is unique, in that selective responses occur in
the context of a 3-layer cortex, reticular nucleus, and thalamus
connected by thalamocortical, corticothalamic, and corticocortical projections.
By changing a few parameters that simulate the effects of the
reduced release of neuromodulators on certain potassium currents, we show that the same model can transition smoothly
between a waking and a sleep mode of firing. In the sleep
mode, the model gives rise to slow oscillations at Ͻ1 Hz that
closely resemble those observed experimentally in vivo and in
vitro, including the bimodal distribution of membrane potentials (Steriade et al. 2001), the irregularity of firing (Shu et al.
2003), the wavelike propagation of the slow oscillation (Massimini et al. 2004; Sanchez-Vives and McCormick 2000), the
marked changes in total membrane conductance between the
up- and down-states (Contreras et al. 1996), and the preserved
balance of excitatory and inhibitory currents throughout the
slow oscillation (Sanchez-Vives and McCormick 2000; Shu et
al. 2003).
In addition, the model offers a self-consistent, multilevel
account of how the slow oscillation is initiated, maintained,
and terminated. Specifically, the model suggests that INa(p) is
the single most important current in the initiation and maintenance of the slow oscillation. This is consistent with experimental observations that INa(p) underlies a broad range of
intrinsic activity in cortical neurons (Mao et al. 2001;
Stafstrom et al. 1984). There are many mechanisms that can
depolarize a neuron sufficiently to activate INa(p). Intrinsic
depolarizing currents such as Ih or synaptic input from the
thalamus are 2 possible mechanisms for activating INa(p). Not
all cells in the model are the same and Ih helps the cells in
L5– 6 initiate the slow oscillation. In an intact system, the
synaptic input that could trigger abrupt transitions to an upstate will be much greater because of the strong corticocortical
inputs.
Experimental and computational studies have provided differing views of how depolarization-dependent potassium currents and synaptic depression are involved in the termination of

93 • MARCH 2005 •

the slow oscillation (Bazhenov et al. 2002; Compte et al. 2003;
Sanchez-Vives and McCormick 2000; Timofeev et al. 2000).
According to the model, IDK and synaptic depression are
jointly important for synchronizing network activity and terminating the up-state. The duration of the down-state is not
determined by a simple parameter such as the conductance or
time constant of IDK. The up-state requires a balance of
excitation and inhibition in the network that must include the
hyperpolarizing influence of IDK. In fact, when IDK was
blocked, the up-state was altered and the network began to
exhibit high-frequency waves of activity. The duration of the
down-state depends on the network’s ability to initiate a new
up-state, which itself is dependent on sufficient synaptic or
intrinsic depolarization to overcome the hyperpolarizing potassium currents (IKL and IDK) and activate the depolarizing
sodium current INa(p). The intricate balance of excitatory and
inhibitory synaptic and intrinsic mechanisms determines the
time course of the down-state.
The simulations also show that the synchronization and
amplitude of the slow oscillation are dependent on the strength
of both intra- and interareal corticocortical connections, confirming and extending experimental results both in vitro
(Sanchez-Vives and McCormick 2000) and in vivo (Amzica
and Steriade 1995a). Moreover, cortical connectivity in the
model plays an important role in determining the spontaneous
activity patterns during both the waking and the sleep mode. In
the waking mode, spontaneous activity is injected from peripheral inputs and filtered through thalamocortical connectivity.
This results in patterns of spontaneous subthreshold depolarizations and correlated firing that reflect the organization of
orientation selectivity. In the sleep mode, spontaneous activity
during the up-state of the slow oscillation is much less selective
because it is generated intrinsically within the entire cortex and
the thalamus is profoundly hyperpolarized.
The model also indicates that the specific balance of excitation
and inhibition that is active during waking is essential for producing balanced up-states during sleep. When the balance of excitation and inhibition in the waking mode is disrupted, the sleep
mode is similarly disrupted and the network tends to seizurelike
activity. The network is particularly prone to any instability during
sleep because of the bistable nature of this mode.
Finally, in the model NMDA plays a critical role in maintaining the up-state and synchronizing the slow oscillation.
This observation may seem to be inconsistent with the fact that
most available data concerning the slow oscillation have been
recorded under conditions of ketamine–xylazine anesthesia
(Steriade et al. 1993), where ketamine is known to be an
NMDA antagonist. Xylazine, however, is an agonist of the ␣2
subunit of GABAA receptors. In the model, when NMDA
blockade was associated with an increase in GABAA conductances (with an additional small augmentation of AMPA conductances), slow oscillations could be observed, albeit with
reduced up-state durations and with a tendency to produce
seizurelike activity.
Other computational models have examined the mechanisms
responsible for the generation of the slow oscillation. Bazhenov et al. (1998, 1999, 2000, 2002) studied sleep rhythms in a
simulated one-dimensional thalamocortical system during both
activated and inactivated states. Compte et al. (2003) modeled
a one-dimensional strip of cortical neurons, lacking a thalamic
architecture, which undergoes a slow oscillation. Besides being
J Neurophysiol • VOL

1695

larger (65,000 neurons vs. a few hundreds), the present model
is 3-dimensional, with a topographically organized cortex subdivided into 3 layers. This has allowed us to model the effects
of both intra- and interlayer connections. The model also has a
higher-order cortical area, Vs, which has allowed us to investigate the effects of corticocortical connections with different
layers of origin and termination on the synchronization of the
slow oscillation. Because the model cortex is subdivided into
functionally specialized minicolumns, we were also able to
evaluate the model’s performance with oriented stimuli during
waking. In this way, we could ensure that the same model
producing the slow oscillation in the sleep mode can also
produce orientation-selective responses in the waking mode.
Despite these differences, at least with respect to the specific
mechanisms responsible for the generation of the slow oscillation, the present results and those of previous models are in
substantial agreement.
Despite its success in reproducing and integrating experimental and computational results at several different levels, our
model, like any other model, has several limitations. For
example, although it contains many tens of thousands of
neurons and several million connections, the model is still a far
cry from real cortical networks, whose size plays a crucial role
in determining the frequency and other characteristics of the
slow oscillation in vivo (Timofeev et al. 2000). The model also
lacks detailed dendritic/axonal morphologies and intracellular
compartments and ignores the possible role of glial cells
(Amzica 2002). Furthermore, in a model this size it is obviously not possible to perform an exhaustive exploration of
parameter space.
The development of this model has required an extensive
exploration of dozens of possible mechanisms and parameters in
the effort to synthesize a unified thalamocortical model that could
reproduce as wide of a range of experimental results possible
within the constraints of anatomical and physiological data. The
process of modeling the slow oscillation started with a system that
produced stable low-firing rate spontaneous activity and high
signal/noise ratio selective responses to visual stimuli in the
waking mode. We retuned the system to incorporate the basic
currents and mechanisms—including INa(p), IDK, and synaptic
depression— believed to play important roles in the slow oscillation. Because the up-state of the sleep mode activates the same
circuitry underlying the spontaneous and evoked activity of the
waking mode, this tuning involved iteratively reestablishing a
balance of excitation and inhibition in the system to prevent
seizurelike activity during sleep and maintain visual response
characteristics of waking. Throughout the evolution of the model,
the refinement process was constrained by matching physiological
data at the level of intracellular traces, cellular input resistance,
extracellular recordings, and LFP. This process converged on a
single model that could satisfy the constraints of reproducing
experimental data of neural activity during both wakefulness and
sleep while modifying parameters influenced only by neuromodulatory changes.
Thus although we tested the robustness of the results to
modifications of dozens of different parameters related to
synaptic interactions, intrinsic properties, spiking characteristics, axonal delays, and synaptic depression—amounting to
more than 3 years of uninterrrupted CPU time—we cannot rule
out an aberrant behavior for some untested parameter combination. Nevertheless, the fact that parameter choices have been

constrained by anatomical and physiological data at multiple
levels, together with the model’s ability to reproduce a wide
range of experimental data, suggest that the present account of
the transition from wakefulness to sleep and for the generation
of the slow oscillation is sufficiently in line with actual biological mechanisms. Finally, by providing a single framework
within which a broad range of neural interactions can be
examined at several different levels in both a sleep and a
waking mode, the model provides a powerful platform for
further investigations into the role of sleep in information
transmission and plasticity (Destexhe and Sejnowski 2001;
Steriade and Timofeev 2003; Tononi and Cirelli 2003).

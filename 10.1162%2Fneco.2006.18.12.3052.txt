We present a mathematical model of a neural mass developed by a number of people, including Lopes da Silva and Jansen. This model features
three interacting populations of cortical neurons and is described by a
six-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. We address some aspects
of its behavior through a bifurcation analysis with respect to the input
parameter of the system. This leads to a compact description of the oscillatory behaviors observed in Jansen and Rit (1995) (alpha activity) and
Wendling, Bellanger, Bartolomei, and Chauvel (2000) (spike-like epileptic activity). In the case of small or slow variation of the input, the model
can even be described as a binary unit. Again using the bifurcation framework, we discuss the influence of other parameters of the system on the
behavior of the neural mass model.
1 Introduction
Jansen’s neural mass model is based on the work of Lopes da Silva, Hoeks,
and Zetterberg (1974), Lopes da Silva, van Rotterdam, Barts, van Heusden, and Burr (1976), and van Rotterdam, Lopes da Silva, van den Ende,
Viergever, and Hermans, (1982). They developed a biologically inspired
mathematical framework to simulate spontaneous electrical activities of
neurons assemblies recorded by EEG, with a particular interest for alpha
activity. In their model, populations of neurons interact by excitation and
inhibition and can, in effect, produce alpha activity. Jansen, Zouridakis, and
Brandt (1993) and Jansen and Rit (1995), discovered that this model was also
able to simulate evoked potentials, that is, EEG activities observed after a
sensory stimulation (such as a flash of light or a sound). More recently,
Wendling, Bellanger, Bartolomei, and Chauvel (2000) used this model to
synthesize activities very similar to those observed in epileptic patients,
and David and Friston (2003); David, Cosmelli, and Friston (2004) studied
connectivity between cortical areas with a similar framework.
The contribution of this letter is a fairly detailed description of the behavior of this particular neural mass model as a function of its input. This

description is grounded in the mathematics of dynamic systems and bifurcation theories. We briefly recall the model in section 2 and describe in
section 3 the properties of the associated dynamical system.
2 Description of the Model.
The model features a population of pyramidal neurons (see the central
part of Figure 1a) that receive excitatory and inhibitory feedback from local
interneurons and an excitatory input from neighboring cortical units and
subcortical structures like the thalamus. Actually the excitatory feedback
must be considered as coming from both local pyramidal neurons and
genuine excitatory interneurons like spiny stellate cells.
2.1 Equations of the Model. Figure 1b is a translation of Figure 1a in
the language of system theory. It represents the mathematical operations

performed inside such a cortical unit. The excitatory input is represented by
an arbitrary average firing rate p(t), which can be random (accounting for
a nonspecific background activity) or deterministic, accounting for some
specific activity in other cortical units. The three families—pyramidal neurons, excitatory interneurons, and inhibitory interneurons—and synaptic
interactions between them are modeled by different systems.
The postsynaptic systems Pi , i = 1, 2, 3 (labeled h e (t) or h i (t) in the figure)
convert the average firing rate describing the input to a population into an
average excitatory (EPSP) or inhibitory (IPSP) postsynaptic potential. From
the signal processing standpoint, they are linear stationary systems that are
described by either a convolution with an impulse response function or,
equivalently, a second-order linear differential equation. They have been
proposed by van Rotterdam et al. (1982) in order to reproduce well the
characteristics of real EPSPs and IPSPs. The impulse response function is of
the form
h(t) =

αβte −βt t ≥ 0
t<0

0

.

In other words, if x(t) is the input to the system, its output y(t) is the
convolution product h ∗ x(t).
The constants α and β are different in the excitatory and inhibitory cases.
α, expressed in millivolts, determines the maximal amplitude of the postsynaptic potentials; β, expressed in s −1 , lumps together characteristic delays
of the synaptic transmission, that is, the time constant of the membrane and
the different delays in the dendritic tree (Freeman, 1975; Jansen et al., 1993).
The corresponding differential equation is
y¨ (t) = αβx(t) − 2β y˙ (t) − β 2 y(t).

(2.1)

In the excitatory (resp. inhibitory) case, we have α = A, β = a (resp.
α = B, β = b). This second-order differential equation can be conveniently
rewritten as a system of two first-order equations:
y˙ (t) = z(t)
z˙ (t) = αβx(t) − 2αz(t) − α 2 y(t)

.

(2.2)

The sigmoid systems introduce a nonlinear component in the model. They
are the gain functions that transform the average membrane potential of a
neural population into an average firing rate (see, e.g., Gerstner & Kistler,
2002):

1 + tanh (v − v0 ) =

1 + e r (v0 −v)

Bifurcation Analysis of Jansen’s Neural Mass Model

where νmax is the maximum firing rate of the families of neurons, v0 is the
value of the potential for which a 50% firing rate is achieved, and r is the
slope of the sigmoid at v0 ; v0 can be viewed as either a firing threshold or
the excitability of the populations. This sigmoid transformation approximates the functions proposed by the neurophysiologist Walter Freeman
(1975) to model the cell body action of a population.
The connectivity constants C1 , . . . , C4 account for the number of
synapses established between two neuron’s populations. We will see that
they can be reduced to a single parameter C.
There are three main variables in the model—the outputs of the three
postsynaptic boxes noted y0 , y1 , and y2 (see Figure 1b). We also consider
their derivatives y˙ 0 , y˙ 1 , y˙ 2 , noted y3 , y4 , and y5 , respectively. If we write two
equations similar to equation 2.2 for each postsynaptic system, we obtain a
system of six first-order differential equations that describes Jansen’s neural
mass model:

2

 y˙0 (t) = y3 (t) y˙3 (t) = Aa Sigm[y1 (t) − y2 (t)] − 2a y3 (t) − a y0 (t)
y˙1 (t) = y4 (t) y˙4 (t) = Aa { p(t) + C2 Sigm[C1 y0 (t)]} − 2a y4 (t) − a 2 y1 (t) (2.3)


y˙2 (t) = y5 (t) y˙5 (t) = BbC4 Sigm[C3 y0 (t)] − 2by5 (t) − b 2 y2 (t).
We focus on the variable y = y1 − y2 , the membrane potential of the main
family of neurons (see Figure 1b). We think of this quantity as the output of
the unit because in the cortex, the pyramidal cells are the main vectors of
long-range cortico-cortical connections. Besides, their electrical activity corresponds to the EEG signal: pyramidal neurons throw their apical dendrites
to the superficial layers of the cortex where the postsynaptic potentials are
summed, accounting for the essential part of the EEG activity (Kandel,
Schwartz, & Jessel, 2000).
2.2 Numerical Values of the Parameters. The parameters A, B, a , and b
have been adjusted by van Rotterdam et al. (1982) to reproduce some basic
properties of real postsynaptic potentials and make the system produce
alpha activity. These authors set A = 3.25 mV, B = 22 mV, a = 100 s−1 , and
b = 50 s−1 .
The excitability of cortical neurons can vary as a function of the action of
several substances, and v0 could potentially take different values, though
we will use v0 = 6 mV as suggested by Jansen on the basis of experimental
studies due to Freeman (1987). The works of the latter also suggest that
νmax = 5s −1 and r = 0.56 mV−1 , the values used by Jansen and Rit (1995).
The connectivity constants Ci , i = 1, . . . , 4 are proportional to the average number of synapses between populations. On the basis of several neu¨ 1998, among others) where

these quantities had been estimated by counting synapses, Jansen and Rit

.

Jansen and Rit varied C to observe alpha-like activity and obtained it for
C = 135 (see Figure 2).

In summary, previous work shows that the following set of parameters
allows the neural mass model described by equations 2.3 to produce a set
of EEG-like signals:


 A = 3.25 B = 22
a = 100 b = 50 .


v0 = 6 C = 135

(2.4)

We show in section 3.4 that the behavior of the neural mass model is fairly
sensitive to the choice of the values of these parameters. Indeed, changes
as small as 5% in these values produce some fairly different behaviors.
The quantity p represents the lumped activity of the brain areas connected to the unit. Jansen and Rit (1995) chose p(t) to be a uniformly distributed noise ranging from 120 to 320 pulses per second, as they wanted
to model nonspecific input (they used the term background spontaneous activity). This noise dynamics allowed them to produce alpha-like activity.
Similarly, Wendling and his colleagues (2000) used a white gaussian noise
(mean 90 and standard deviation 30) for p(t) and observed the emission
of spikes that was reminiscent of an epileptic activity. We show in the next
section that these two different behaviors can be nicely accounted for by a
geometric study of system 2.3 through its bifurcations.
3 Bifurcations and Oscillations
In this section we consider p as a parameter of the system and propose to
study the behavior of a unit when p varies. We therefore study the dynamical system 2.3, with all parameters but p being kept constant and equal to
the values set by Jansen and Rit (1995) (see equation 2.4). In section 3.4 we
extend this analysis to other values of the parameters in equation 2.4. Let
Y = (y0 , . . . , y5 )T ; the system has the form
Y˙ = f (Y, p),
where f is the smooth map from R6 to R6 given by equation 2.3 and p is a
parameter.
We are interested in computing the fixed points and periodic orbits of
the system as functions of p because they will allow us to account for the
appearance of such activities as those shown in Figure 2 (alpha-like activity)
and Figure 3 (epileptic spike-like activity).
3.1 Fixed Points
3.1.1 The One Parameter Family of Fixed Points. We look for the points Y
where the vector field f (., p) vanishes (called fixed points, critical points, or

activities. (f–i) Real activities recorded from epileptic patients before (f,g) and

(3.2)

As mentioned before, y = y1 − y2 can be thought of as representing the EEG
activity of the unit, and p is our parameter of interest. We show the curve
defined by equation 3.2 in Figure 4a. The number of intersections between
this curve and a vertical line of equation p = consta nt is the number of
equilibrium points for this particular value of p. We notice that for p ≈ 110–
120, the system goes from three equilibrium points to a single one. We also
note that the curve has been drawn for some negative values of p. These
points do not have any biological meaning since p is a firing rate. It turns
out, though, that they play a central role in the mathematical description of
the model (see section 3.2).
The coordinates of the singular points cannot be written explicitly as
functions of p, but every singular point is completely determined by the
quantity y. More precisely, the coordinates of every singular point S(y) have
the following form:
S(y) =

3.1.2 Local Study Near the Singular Points. In order to study the behavior
of the system near the fixed points, we linearize it and calculate its Jacobian
matrix, that is, the partial derivative J of f (., p) at the fixed point S(y). It is
easy but tedious to show that at the fixed point S(y), we have

curves between points 3 and 5 give the highest and lowest y values attained by
the Hopf cycle. The other branch of limit cycles lies in the domain between the

and the dash-dotted line 4 representing a fold bifurcation of limit cycles. This
kind of representation is called a bifurcation diagram. (d) A Hopf bifurcation at

limit cycles.

We compute the eigenvalues of J along the curve of Figure 4a to analyze
the stability of the family of equilibrium points. The results are summarized
in Figure 4b. The solid portions of curve correspond to stable fixed points
(all eigenvalues have a negative real part) and the dashed ones to unstable
fixed points (some eigenvalues have a positive real part). Stars indicate
points where at least one eigenvalue of the system crosses the imaginary
axis, therefore having a zero real part. These points are precious landmarks
for the study of bifurcations of the system.
3.2 Bifurcations and Oscillatory Behavior in Jansen’s Model. A bifurcation is a drastic and sudden change in the behavior of a dynamic system
that occurs when one or several of its parameters are varied. Often it corresponds to the appearance or disappearance of limit cycles. Describing
oscillatory behaviors in Jansen’s model is therefore closely related to studying its bifurcations. In our case, when p varies from −∞ to +∞, the system
undergoes five bifurcations (remember that only the positive values of p
are biologically relevant).
We now describe these bifurcations from a somewhat intuitive viewpoint, but our results are grounded in the mathematical theory of bifurcations (Perko, 2001; Ioos & Adelmeyer, 1999; Kuznetsov, 1998; Berglund,
2001a, 2001b) and the extensive use of the software XPP-Aut due to Bard
Ermentrout (available on http://www.pitt.edu/∼phase/). We were also
inspired by bifurcation studies of single-neuron models (see Izhikevich, in
press; Hoppenstaedt & Izhikevich, 1997; Rinzel & Ermentrout, 1998).
3.2.1 Hopf Bifurcations and Alpha Activity in Jansen’s Model. When p is
varied smoothly, the eigenvalues of the fixed points move smoothly in the
complex plane: when two complex conjugate eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis, the system undergoes in general what is called a Hopf bifurcation.
Two of them happen in Jansen’s model (if we ignore the negative values
of p) for p = 89.83 and p = 315.70. A theorem due to Hopf (Perko, 2001)

3062

F. Grimbert and O. Faugeras

shows1 that for p = 89.83, a one-parameter family of stable periodic orbits appears at the fixed point that has two complex conjugate eigenvalues
crossing the imaginary axis toward positive real parts. These periodic orbits persist until p = 315.70, where a second Hopf bifurcation occurs: the
two eigenvalues whose real parts became positive for p = 89.83 see them
become negative again, corresponding to the (re)creation of a simple, attractive fixed point. This is shown in Figure 4c: for p between 89.83 and
315.70, there is a family of periodic orbits (we call them Hopf cycles from
now on) parameterized by p for which the minimal and maximal y values
have been plotted (thick oval curve). Numerically, using XPP-Aut, we find
that these oscillations have a frequency around 10 Hz, which corresponds
to alpha activity. So it appears that alpha-like activity in Jansen’s model
is determined by Hopf cycles. Interestingly enough, the system does not
display any Hopf bifurcation if we approximate the sigmoid by a piecewise
linear function, or if we try to reduce the dimensionality of the system by
singular perturbation theory (Berglund 2001b). In both cases, the system is
unable to produce alpha activity.
Let us interpret Jansen and Rit’s results in the light of our mathematical analysis. They report observing alpha activity (see the third curve in
Figure 2) when they use a uniformly distributed noise in the range 120 to
320 Hz at the entry of the system. This is easy to account for if we look at
Figure 4c: in this domain of p values, the Hopf cycles are essentially the only
attractors of the dynamical system 2.3. So at every time instant t, its trajectories will tend to coil around the Hopf cycle corresponding to p = p(t). We
will therefore see oscillations of constant frequency and varying amplitude
leading to the waxing and waning activity reported by Jansen and Rit.
3.2.2 Global Bifurcations and Spike-Like Epileptic Activity. Hopf bifurcations are called local because their appearance depends on only local properties of the dynamical system around the bifurcation point. In Figure 3,
we see that the system is able to display spike-like activities that resemble
certain epileptic EEG recordings (Wendling et al., 2000). These activities
arise from a branch of large stable periodic orbits delimited by a pair of
global bifurcations (i.e., depending not only on local properties of the dynamical system) that correspond to the star labeled 1 and the dash-dotted
line labeled 4 in Figure 4c. From now on, we will call these orbits spike cycles.
The branch of spike cycles begins for p = 113.58, thanks to a saddlenode bifurcation with homoclinic orbit2 (see Perko, 2001; Kuznetsov, 1998).
It ends for p = 137.38 because of a fold bifurcation of limit cycles that we
1 The proof of the existence of a Hopf bifurcation relies on the calculation of the
Lyapunov number at the bifurcation points. It is quite technical and is not developed
here.
2 The proof of the existence of this saddle node bifurcation with homoclinic orbit uses
a theorem due to Shil’nikov (Kuznetsov, 1998).

identified with XPP-Aut. This bifurcation results from the fusion of a stable
and an unstable family of periodic orbits. The stable family is the branch
of spike cycles, and the unstable family originates from a Hopf bifurcation
occuring at p = −12.15.
Thanks to XPP-Aut, we have been able to plot the folding and the associated Hopf bifurcation with respect to the y0 axis (see Figure 4d). So far we
have shown the bifurcation diagrams in the ( p, y) plane, but for technical
reasons due to XPP-Aut, we show the bifurcation diagram in the ( p, y0 )
plane in this case. Its general properties are the same, though. For example, we recognize the S shape of the fixed points diagram and the relative
position of landmarks 1, 2, and 4.
Contrary to the Hopf cycles whose periods remains around 10 Hz, the
spike cycles can display every frequency in the range 0 to 5 Hz (it increases
with p) so that they are able to reproduce the various “spiking” activities
observed in Figure 3.
In this case also we can identify the central role played by p in shaping the
output of the unit. Wendling et al. (2000) used a gaussian noise with mean
90 and standard deviation 30 to produce the spikes in Figure 3, resulting
in an input to the unit essentially varying between 30 and 150 Hz, which
is quite low compared to the range used by Jansen and Rit (1995). Let us
first distinguish two parts in the curve of fixed points in Figure 4c. We
call the set of stable fixed points below the star labeled 1 lower branch and
the one between the stars labeled 2 and 3 upper branch. For p between 30
and 90, the system displays a classical bistable behavior with two stable
fixed points (one on each branch), the lowest fixed points appearing to
be dominant. We found experimentally that the basin of attraction of the
upper point is not very large, so that one has to start quite close to it in
order to converge to it. As a result, a low input ( p ≤ 90) produces in general
a low output: the trajectory is attracted by the lower branch. For p between
110 and 140, we are in the range of p values where spike-like activity can
appear and spiking competes with Hopf cycles, but trajectories near the
lower branch are attracted by spike cycles (as we will see in section 3.3),
hence producing spike-shaped activities. These two facts—attraction to the
lower branch and preference of the lower branch for spike cycles—allow us
to understand how the model can produce epileptic-like activities.
3.3 Synthesis: Behavior of the Cortical Unit Model According to the
Input Parameter p. We now have in hand all the ingredients to describe
the activity of this neural mass model when stimulated by a slowly varying
input. For that purpose, we computed two trajectories (or orbits) of the
system with p increasing linearly in time at a slow rate (d p/dt = 1). The
system was initialized at the two stable fixed points at p = 0: the stable
state on the lower branch and the one on the upper branch (see the stars in
Figure 5). As long as p ≤ 89.83, the two trajectories are flat, following their
respective branches of fixed points (see Figure 6, p = 80). After the Hopf

Figure 5: Diagram of the stable attractors (stable fixed points and stable limit

points of the two trajectories we simulated with p slowly increasing. Their time
courses have been frozen for p = 80, 100, 125, and 200 (as indicated by the
vertical dashed lines on this figure) and can be seen in Figure 6. Lower and
upper states of the unit correspond to the thick and thin lines, respectively.

bifurcation occurring at p = 89.83, the orbit corresponding to the upper
branch naturally coils on the Hopf cycles branch (see Figure 6, p = 100),
resulting in alpha-like activity. The trajectory on the lower branch does the
same with the spike cycles as soon as p reaches the value 113.58 (see Figure 6,
p = 125). As p ≥ 137.38, the only remaining attractor is the Hopf cycle
branch so that the system can exhibit only alpha-like behavior (see Figure 6,
p = 200). For high values of p (≥315.70), there is only one stable fixed point,
and the trajectory is flat again. These results lead us to distinguish two states,
the lower and the upper, for the unit. The lower state is described by the
combination of the lower branch of fixed points that correspond to rest and
the spike cycles (thick lines in Figure 5). It corresponds to positive values of
p less than 137.38. The upper state is described by the upper branch of fixed
points, the Hopf cycle branch, and the branch of fixed points following it
(thin lines in Figure 5). It corresponds to positive values of p. These states
are relevant for slow dynamics of the input p. In effect, a trajectory starting

Figure 6: Activities produced by Jansen’s neural mass model for typical values
of the input parameter p (see the text). The thin (resp. thick) curves are the
time courses of the output y of the unit in its upper (resp. lower) state. For
p > 137.38, there is only one possible behavior of the system. In the case of
oscillatory activities, we added a very small amount of noise to p (a zero mean
gaussian noise with standard deviation 0.05).

near one of these states will stay in its neighborhood when p is varied
slowly (increasing or decreasing). When the unit is in its lower-state and p
becomes larger than 137.38, it jumps to its upper state and cannot return to
its lower state (if p varies slowly). Therefore, when in its upper state, a unit
essentially produces alpha-like activity, and its input must be decreased
abruptly to bring it back to its lower state. Conversely, starting in the lower
state, a unit can be brought to the upper state by an abrupt increase of its
input. It can also stay in its lower state regime, between rest and spiking, if
the input and its variation remain moderate.
3.4 What About Other Parameters? We think that the bifurcation analysis with respect to p is the most relevant since this parameter is expected to
vary more and faster than the others, but it is interesting to build bifurcation
diagrams with respect to p with different settings of the other parameters.

Figure 7: The stable attractors of the system in two typical cases encountered for
different settings of parameters A, B, C, a , or b. (a) Corresponds to lower (resp.
higher) values of A, B, C (resp. a and b) than those given by equation 2.4. Here,
A = 3 instead of 3.25: there are no more limit cycles. (b) Corresponds to higher
(resp. lower) values of A, B, C (resp. a and b). Here C = 140 instead of 135. The
spiking behavior is more prominent and is the only one available in a wide range
of p values (112.6 ≤ p ≤ 173.1). Except in a narrow band (173.1 ≤ p ≤ 180.4),
the system displays one single behavior for each value of p.

We indeed observed that varying any parameter by more than 5% leads to
quite drastic changes in the bifurcation diagram and to significantly less
rich behaviors of the unit. These changes fall into two broad categories (see
Figure 7).
For low values of A, B, or C or high values of a or b, the system is no
longer able to produce oscillations (see Figure 7a). For high values of A, B,
or C or low values of a or b, we observed a new kind of bifurcation diagram
(an example is given in Figure 7b). In this regime, the system has only one
stable state for each value of p, except sometimes in a narrow range of p
values (in the figure, 173.1 ≤ p ≤ 180.4). The range where spiking can occur
is broader and the one for alpha activity is severely truncated. Moreover,
spiking does not coexist with alpha rhythm anymore so that (except for a
very small range of p values) it is the only available behavior on a broad
interval of p values (in the figure, 112.6 ≤ p ≤ 173.1). So spiking becomes
really prominent.
The mathematical explanation for this new diagram is the fusion of the
Hopf cycles branch with the branch of unstable periodic orbits that can
be seen in Figure 4d. It results in a new organization of periodic orbit
branches. We have two stable branches (for 112.6 ≤ p ≤ 180.4 and 173.1 ≤
p ≤ 457.1), linked by a branch of unstable orbits. Transitions between stable
and unstable orbits are made via fold bifurcations of limit cycles like the
one in Figure 4d.

Bifurcation Analysis of Jansen’s Neural Mass Model

4 Conclusion
The bifurcation diagram (see Figure 5) is a precious tool to describe Jansen’s
neural mass model’s behaviors for constant or slowly varying stimulus. We
also showed that this analysis provided a good basis for understanding
what happened when the input was noisy. In the case of small or slow
variations of this input, the model can be reduced to a binary unit with two
possible states.
When we studied how the bifurcation diagram varied when changing the
values of the other model’s parameters, it appeared that Jansen’s model’s
behavior was quite sensitive to the choice of the physiological parameters
A, B, C, a , and b. Variations of a few percentages in the values of these
parameters can cause drastic changes in the qualitative behavior of this
neural mass model. Detailed comparisons of these behaviors with experimental data should be essential for further validation of the model and for
defining ways to make it evolve.
What about the behavior of spatial assemblies of such models? Jansen
et al. have studied evoked potentials in two connected cortical units (Jansen
& Rit, 1995; Jansen et al., 1993) and Wendling et al. (2000) have simulated an
epileptogenic network composed of three units. There are still no studies
involving an arbitrary number of such units or a continuum of them.
This is a difficult task for at least three reasons. First, the size of the
system of differential equations describing the network increases linearly
with the number of units, making its mathematical analysis even more
difficult. Second, the nonlinearities in the model and the network open the
door to emerging properties impossible to predict from the sole knowledge
of the behavior of one unit. Third, the way to connect those units is an open
question since our knowledge of anatomical connectivity in the cortex is
still very poor. Nevertheless, we think this is an important area for future
work.

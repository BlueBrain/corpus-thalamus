Abstract. This study deals with neurophysiologically
based models simulating electrical brain activity (i.e., the
electroencephalogram or EEG, and evoked potentials or
EPs). A previously developed lumped-parameter model
of a single cortical column was implemented using
a more accurate computational procedure. Anatomically
acceptable values for the various model parameters were
determined, and a multi-dimensional exploration of the
model parameter-space was conducted. It was found that
the model could produce a large variety of EEG-like
waveforms and rhythms. Coupling two models, with delays in the interconnections to simulate the synaptic
connections within and between cortical areas, made it
possible to replicate the spatial distribution of alpha and
beta activity. EPs were simulated by presenting pulses to
the input of the coupled models. In general, the responses
were more realistic than those produced using a single
model. Our simulations also suggest that the scalp-recorded EP is at least partially due to a phase reordering
of the ongoing activity.

1 Introduction

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a recording of the
spontaneous electrical activity of the brain recorded from
surface electrodes placed on the scalp (Martin 1985). An
evoked potential (EP) is a specific change in the ongoing
EEG resulting from stimulation of a sensory pathway.
The EEG and EP result mainly from extracellular
current flow associated with summed postsynaptic
potentials in synchronously activated, vertically oriented
neurons.
The complexity of the EEG signal reflects the intricate cortical structures which produce it. In order to
study the latter, various mathematical models have been
developed to simulate electrical brain activity (see, for
example, Freeman 1987; Lopes da Silva et al. 1976). The
concept of a neuronal model makes it possible to reduce

the complexity of cortical connections to relatively
simple circuits. If the model parameters are based on
anatomical data, such as the number of synapses or the
excitability of neurons, then it is possible to test their
respective role and influence.
The present study deals with the further development
and exploration of a neurophysiologically based model
of a cortical column, proposed by Jansen et al. (1993).
First, a thorough evaluation of the effects brought about
by variations in the parameters of the postsynaptic potential (PSP) functions and potential-to-pulse density
transformation defining the model were conducted to
explore the different kinds of activities a single model
could produce. Next, we investigated to what degree the
various components of the scalp-recorded visual evoked
potential (VEP) are due to (1) the arrival of the specific
afferent activity associated with the visual stimulus
and/or (2) interaction between cortical areas.
Section 2 presents a brief review of the model on
which the present study is based, followed by a presentation of the double-column model, and a discussion of the
parameter settings. The spontaneous and evoked activities that such a model may produce are presented in
Sect. 3. A discussion concludes this paper.

2 EEG and EP modeling

2.1 Single-column model
The mechanisms of oscillation generation in the brain
have been proven to be nonlinear, both in cats
(Kawashima et al. 1983; Shibagaki et al. 1985) and in
humans (Watanabe and Shikita 1981). Hence, nonlinear
models should be used to describe cortical activity. The
present study deals with the further development and
exploration of a nonlinear model of a cortical column
described by Jansen et al. (1993). This model, in turn, is
based upon Lopes da Silva's lumped parameter model
(Lopes da Silva et al. 1974, 1976; Rotterdam et al. 1982).
The cortical column is modeled by a population of
'feedforward' pyramidal cells, receiving inhibitory and
excitatory feedback from local interneurons (i.e., other

column) and excitatory input from neighboring or more
distant columns (Fig. 1). The latter input is represented
by a pulse density p(t) which can be any arbitrary
function, including white noise (see Sect. 2.2 for further
details).
Each of the neuron populations is modeled by two
blocks. The first block transforms the average pulse density of action potentials coming to the population of
neurons into an average postsynaptic membrane potential which can either be excitatory or inhibitory. This
block is referred to as the PSP block and represents
a linear transformation with an impulse response given
by

which can be rewritten as

(5)

where x(t) and y(t) are the input and output signals,
respectively. Using (5) we obtain the gollowing set of six
differential equations to describe the model:

Y3 (t) = Aa Sigm [yl (t) - Yz (t)] - 2ay3 (t) - a 2 Yo (t)
(2)

for the inhibitory case. A and B determine the maximum
amplitude of the excitatory and inhibitory PSP (EPSP
and IPSP), respectively, and a and b are the lumped
representation of the sum of the reciprocal of the time
constant of passive membrane and all other spatially
distributed delays in the dendritic network. The second
block transforms the average membrane potential of
a population of neurons into an average pulse density of
action potentials fired by the neurons. This transformation is described by a sigmoid function of the form

representing the supplementary excitation due to nonspecific afferent inputs. The effect of this branch is expected to be replicated by the interaction between
coupled models.]

of the form

where Yo, Y~, and Y2 are the outputs of the three PSP
blocks, respectively. These differential equations were
solved using an integration method based on the
Fehlberg fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta method.

which is a simplified, but identically behaving version of
the transformation presented in Jansen et al. (1993). Here,
eo determines the maximum firing rate of the neural
population, Vo the PSP for which a 50% firing rate is
achieved, and r the steepness of the sigmoidal transformation.
The interaction between the pyramidal cells and the
excitatory and inhibitory interneurons is characterized
by the four connectivity constants C1 through C4, which
account for the total number of synapses established by
interneurons onto the axons and dendrites of the neurons
constituting the cortical column. [In the model originally
presented in Jansen et al. (1993), there was an additional

2.2 Double-column model
The hypothesis that certain VEP components are due to
an interaction between two or more cortical columns
was explored using two coupled model columns. Both
columns are based on (6), but the system parameters (e.g.,
A, B and Vo) can be different for each column. Each
column is fed by two inputs: an external one, which can
be different for each column, and the output of the other
column. Two connectivity constants, K1 and K2, attenuate the output of a column before it is fed to the other. In
some experiments, a delay, ad, will also be incorporated
in these factors. The resulting double model is represented schematically in Fig. 2.

359
Typically, one of the two columns in the doublecolumn model may represent the visual cortex, while the
second one models the prefrontal cortex. We will assume
that the same cortical column model can be used for the
visual and prefrontal cortex. This assumption is supported by the fact that the basic neuronal architecture of
the cortex is similar throughout its areas (Cynader et al.
1988; Gilbert et al. 1988). However, the proportions of
cell types differ from one cortical area to the next. These
differences will be represented by a different setting of the
model parameter values. The prefrontal cortex typically
displays beta activity (Martin 1985). The various parameters of the column will be set so that the column
produces such an activity when the input is random
noise. [The many projections of the thalamus to the
prefrontal cortex, which have been described in recent
articles by Barbas et al. (1991) and Tanibuchi (1992),
substantiate the assumption of a random-noise input.]
The column representing the visual cortex will be made
to generate alpha activity when receiving random input.
The specific parameter values will be determined on the
basis of the outcome of the exploration of the singlecolumn parameter-space.
The cortical columns located in area 17 are linked to
the prefrontal cortex via two other cortical areas: the
prestriate cortex (areas 18 and 19), and the inferotemporal cortex. Hence at least three neurons are necessary
to account for the pathways of the processing of a visual
stimulus by the prefrontal cortex and three more for the
feedback to the occipital visual cortex. The delays are
modeled by linear transformations similar to he(t), defined in Eq. 1, but with a latency 3 times longer. This
latency is inversely proportional to the he (t) parameter a;
hence the intercolumn delay will be modeled by
hd(t)={Aadte-"dt

t>/O
t< 0

(7)

where ad ~ a/3.
The analytical description of such a double-column
model obviously requires twice as many variables as for
a single column. Three of the new variables, i.e., Y6, Y7,
and Ys, are used in the second column, and are equivalent
to Yo, Y~, and Y2, respectively. Four additional variables
are required to represent the delay blocks in the two
intercolumn branches: Y12, Y13, Y14, and Y~5. The variables Y12 and Y13 are the outputs of the EPSP blocks
added to the branches linking column 1 to column 2 and
column 2 to column 1, respectively. Hence, the following
set of equations defining the double-column model is
obtained:

2.3 Model parameters

A literature review uncovered a number of useful relationships between the connectivity constants Ca to C4.
These constants are proportional to the average number
of synapses between the pyramidal cells and the excitatory and inhibitory feedback elements. Specifically,
C1 represents the number of synapses made by the feedforward neurons to the dendrites of the excitatory feedback loop; Cz is proportional to the number of synapses
made by the excitatory feedback loop to the dendrites of
the feedforward neurons (typically, such counts include
synapses of a thalamic origin, indicated here by C~);
C3 stands for the number of synapses made by the feedforward neurons to the dendrites of the inhibitory feedback loop; and C4 is proportional to the number of
synapses made by the inhibitory feedback loop to the
dendrites of the feedforward neurons.
Studies of the visual cortex pyramidal cell of a mouse
(Braitenberg and SchiJz 1991) suggest that
C 1 --[- C 3 -~- C 2 --[- C2 + C 4

(9)

Elhanany and White (1990) found that in the mouse
somato-motor cortex, a pyramidal cell axon would make
87% of its synapses on spines and 13% on shafts. It has
been observed (White 1989) that a synapse made onto
a spine is onto an excitatory (pyramidal) cell, but that
a synapse onto a shaft is equally likely to be on an
excitatory or an inhibitory cell. Hence, about 6.5% of the
synapses made by a pyramidal cell are inhibitory. Therefore,
C3/(C1 + C3) = 6.5/100

(10)

360

Liu et al. (1991) established that 80% of the synapses
made on a pyramidal cell dendrite in the cat motor cortex
were of the excitatory type, hence
(C2 + C'2)/[(Cz + C~) + C4] = 0.8

(11)

Most of the excitatory cells in the visual cortex are
pyramidal cells (Braitenberg and Schiiz 1991; Larkman
1991), hence the excitatory feedback loop is composed
mainly of pyramidal cells. If the population of such cells
is assumed to be homogeneous with regard to synapse
patterns (i.e., all pyramidal cells establish the same number of synapses with other cells), then the number of
synapses made by the feedforward neurons of a cortical
column on the excitatory feedback loop should be the
same as the number of synapses made by the excitatory
feedback loop on the feedforward neurons. This leads to
C 1 = C 2 + C2

(12)

According to White (1986), about 20% of the asymmetrical synapses (those assumed to be of the excitatory type)
in layer IV of the cortex are formed by thalamo-cortical
terminals, i.e.,

C'2/(C2 + C~) = 0.2 =:, C~ = Cz/4

fixed values as used before (Jansen et al. 1993), namely,
a = 100 s- 1 and b = 50 s- 1. The PSP blocks accounting
for the delays in the intercolumn branches in the doublecolumn model will use the same A as the other PSP
blocks, but ad = 30 S-1.
The excitability of cortical neurons is also very sensitive to a variety of substances (McCormick et al. 1991;
Albus et al. 1992; Nowicky et al. 1992). Hence the effect of
varying Vo, which accounts for the firing threshold in (3),
will be studied, but in most cases we will use Vo = 6 mV,
as suggested by Freeman (1987). The remaining parameters in (3) will remain fixed, with eo = 2.5 s-1 and
r = 0.56 mV-1.
Following our previous study (Jansen et al. 1993), the
random white noise input p(t) will have an amplitude
varying between 120 and 320 pulses per second.

(13)

3 Results
The first two parts of this section present the types
of spontaneous activity produced by a single cortical
column, and by two mutually coupled models, respectively. The third part presents the evoked activity generated using the double-column model.

Substituting (13) in (12), one obtains

C2/C1 = 0.8

(14)

From (9) and (12) we get
C3 = C4

(15)

The relationship between the number of synapses on
the excitatory and inhibitory feedback loops is more
ambiguous. For example, (10) yields C1 = 14.4C3, while
substituting (12) and (15)in (11) yields C1 = 4Ca. These
discrepancies may be due to the different biological
materials used in the synapse counts, the variability
associated with such studies, and the actual differences
between pyramidal cells throughout the visual cortex.
We will assume that C1 = 4C3, resulting in
C1 = C2/0.8 = 4C3 = 4C4

(16)

These relationships allow us to represent each of
the four connectivity constants as a fraction of one
constant, C. Specifically, by selecting C = C~, we obtain
C2 = 0.8C; C3 = 0.25C; and C, = 0.25C. The variable
C is one of the parameters most likely to vary under
different physiological constraints, because it accounts
for synaptic phenomena such as neurotransmitter depletion, which are common and can have drastic consequences.
The A and B parameters of the PSP functions are
proportional to the amplitude of the PSP. It is suggested
that A = 3.25 mV and B = 22 mV (van Rotterdam et al.
1982). Certain neuropeptides modify the amplitude of the
PSPs (Dodt et al. 1991), hence A and B have to be
granted a degree of freedom. The a and b parameters of
the PSP blocks are inversely proportional to the duration of the PSP. These are less likely to vary over relatively short periods, and therefore will be set to the same

3.1 Spontaneous activity in a single-column model
The literature suggests that the model produces oscillating output if A = 3.25 mV (van Rotterdam et al. 1982),
B = 22 mV (van Rotterdam et al. 1982), and vo = 6 mV
(Freeman 1987). N o such information can be found for
the lumped connectivity constant parameter C. The effect
of this parameter was explored experimentally, using the
other parameters set to the aforementioned values and
a random input uniformly distributed between 120 and
320 pulses per second. Varying C led to the different
kinds of output presented in Fig. 3. As can be seen,
increasing C results in an output evolving from noise to
noisy alpha-like activity, to well-defined alpha-like activity (at C = 135), and a quasi-periodic signal resembling
spike-wave complexes with a frequency getting lower
until it reaches zero and finally becomes noise-like.
The fact that alpha-like activity was seen for C = 135
led us to define the following set of standard values for the
model parameters of the visual cortical column:
A = 3.25
B = 22

(17)

C = 135
Vo = 6

Similar activity as presented in Fig. 3 was found when
either A, B or Vo was independently increased from a low
value to a high one. This can be explained as follows. The
third panel from the top in Fig. 3 demonstrates that the
output level is between 5 and 10 when the standard
values are used, i.e., in the linear range of the sigmoid
defining the potential-to-density transformation. If the
feedback is increased (by increasing A or decreasing B),

Fig. 3. Two seconds of the model's output when the lumped connectivity constant C equals (from top to bottom) 68, 128, 135, 270, 675, and
1350, respectively. The input is uniformly distributed random noise

then the global level of the input (i.e., the random input
added to the feedback level) will be in the upper saturating region of the sigmoid, bringing about a constant
output of the sigmoid transformation, hence a constant
feedback, hence no oscillations. If, on the other hand, the
feedback is decreased (by decreasing A or increasing B),
then the global level of the input will be in the lower
saturating region of the sigmoid, bringing about a null
output of the sigmoid transformation, hence a null feedback, hence a global input reduced to the random input
leading to nonoscillatory behavior as presented in Fig. 3
for a low value of C. Changing the value of Vo corresponds to shifting the range of the linear part of the
sigmoid, eventually leading to one of the two aforementioned nonoscillatory cases.
A more detailed exploration of the four-dimensional
parameter-space (A, B, C and Vo)was done around values
for which alpha and other periodic activity was generated. Specifically, A was varied between 2.6 and 9.75 mV,
B ranged from 17.6 to 110 mV, C from 108 to 675, and
Vo was either 3.12, 5.52, or 6.0 mV. The results are presented in Fig. 4, which shows that the region of the
parameter-space where the system oscillates is bounded
by two regions of noise. An increase or decrease in any
parameter from a point of oscillation will eventually lead
to a nonoscillatory mode. The two aforementioned regions of noise never touch one another. One is characteristic of a relatively high B parameter compared with A,
i.e., a low excitatory feedback, and will be referred to as
hypoactive noise. The other noise region will be denoted
as hyperactive noise, and resembles the fast, low-amplitude EEG seen during mental activity ('beta activity').

column. The input is random noise

Going from the hypoactive noise region to the hyperactive one, a path in the parameter-space would cross the
regions always in the same order: starting at a lowfrequency quasi-periodic signal (2-3 Hz), via a higherfrequency quasi-periodic signal (8-9 Hz), and alpha
activity, to a noisy alpha, and, finally, to the hyperactive
noise. It is interesting to note, however, that for C = 135
and Vo = 6, the region for which the system oscillates
forms a valley; for a B value of less than 22, an increase or
a decrease in A will lead to hyperactive noise, the hypoactive region being reachable for high B values only.
3.2 Spontaneous activity in a double-column model
Simulation of the interactions of two columns located in the
visual cortex. A double-column model was built with the
parameters of both columns set to identical values. The
values were chosen such that a single column produced
alpha activity when receiving random input. A zero-delay
was used in the intercolumn branches to mimic the short
neural pathways linking columns located in the same
cortical area. Both columns received uncorrelated, random, uniformly distributed inputs (between 120 and 320
pulses per second) while K1 and Kz were varied simultaneously between 0 and 120 in steps of 10.
As shown in Fig. 5, the model behaves symmetrically
for variations in K1 and Kz, which is predictable given
the symmetry of the system, i.e., two identical columns
fed with similar inputs. The results also demonstrate that,
if one of the intercolumn connectivity coefficients is
small (Ki < 12), then both columns generate a waxing
and waning output. This is understandable, because the

Fig. 5. Four differentclassesof oscillatorybehaviorwereobservedfor
a double-columnmodel(no delay)composedof identicalcolumnswith
parameters at their standardvalues,and fed withuncorrelatedrandom
inputs. The parameters K1 and K2 are the intercolumnconnectivity
constants
parameters of each column have purposely been set to
obtain that kind of behavior if the columns are not
coupled. Synchronized activity was obtained when both
K values where as small as 1.4, which demonstrates that
a weak coupling between the two columns is enough to
reach synchronization.
If K~ and K2 are jointly increased, then the symmetrical coupling between the two columns first induces a decrease in the waxing and waning of the output, which
becomes almost sinusoidal. It is worthy of note that
increasing the coupling up to 80 tends to shift the frequency of the synchronized outputs downwards, from
10.5 Hz to 8 Hz, whereas a further increase in the coupling from 80 to 90 brings about an increase in the output
frequency. An even larger increase in K~ and K2 provokes a saturation of the columns. Accordingly, their
outputs look more and more noisy, until desynchronization is reached and the columns produce a noise-like
signal. This global behavior corroborates the singlecolumn study: a zero-coupling ease corresponds to
a single column with the (A, B, C, Vo) parameters set to
their standard values, hence a 10 Hz waxing and waning
activity. Increasing the coupling between the two columns roughly corresponds to an increase in the excitatory feedback. As shown in Fig. 4, starting from the
standard values, an increase in A, while keeping the other
parameters fixed, leads to outputs that are first waxing
and waning, proceed to become sinusoidal-like, once
more exhibit waxing and waning, and eventually become
noise-like.

Simulation of the interactions of two columns located in
different cortical areas. In the following experiments the
parameter values for column 1 have been set to the
standard set, so that it represents a column in the
visual cortex. Model column 2 is supposed to represent
a prefrontal column, and its parameters have been
selected such that it produces beta-like activity. As
can be seen from Fig. 4, beta-like activity is produced
for a range of values for A, B, and C when vo = 6.0
(the standard value), and we selected arbitrarily
A' =3.25, B ' = 17.6, and C ' = 108. Both columns
received uncorrelated random inputs uniformly distributed between 120 and 320 pulses per second. K1
was varied between 0 and 8000 in steps increasing from
50 to 4000 units, while K2 was varied from 0 to 1500
in steps of 100 to 500 units. Anatomically, the feedforward connections to the prefrontal cortex are stronger
than the feedback connections to the visual cortex
(Pandya and Yeterian 1990), justifying a setting of
K1 roughly one order of magnitude larger than K2.
A delay, corresponding to three synapses, was incorporated in the connections between the model columns, as
discussed Sect. 2.2.
The results of the simulations are presented in Fig. 6.
For small values of K2 (< 200), the output of column
1 was of the waxing and waning type, irrespective of the
value of K1. This is consistent with the fact that the
model was designed so that column 1 would produce
alpha activity when it is independent. As K2 was increased, the additional feedback progressively saturated
column 1, causing the output to wax and wane more
sharply, displaying more high-frequency components
until it eventually resembled beta activity. The output of
column 2 resembled beta activity when the column operated independently, i.e., for small K~ and K2. For
K2 < 500, increasing K~ causes column 2 gradually to
change its output from beta-like to alpha-like activity.
However, for K2 > 700, column 2 produced beta-like
activity exclusively.
3.3 Evoked potentials

Simulations of evoked potentials were done on the
two types of double-column model explored in the
previous two subsections, namely the model with two
identical columns and no delay in the intercolumn
connections, and the model with the two different
columns and delays in the interconnections. The doublecolumn models received two types of input, namely
random and transient activity. The random input was
provided to both columns, and was uniformly distributed
between 120 and 320 pulses per second. This input
represents the 'spontaneous background' activity. A
transient component, representing the impulse density

activity when stimulated by random input). This transient is similar to the one used in Jansen et al. (1992), and is

with one column located in the visual cortex and one in the prefrontal
area (delay equivalent to three synapses)

with n = 7, w = 0.005 (if t is in seconds), and q = 0.5. The
models were run for 6 s before the stimulus was applied to
avoid transient behavior, and ensemble averages of 20 or
40 single trials each were computed for each model, using
a different random input for each trial. An actual scalprecorded flash VEP is presented in Fig. 7 for comparison.

Identical columns. Experiments with two interconnected,
identical models (no delays in the interconnections,
and K = K1 = K2) revealed that a multicomponent
response was produced for low K values ( < 10) by
column 1. A W shape around 100 ms after the stimulus
can be observed (Fig. 8). Although it appears in certain
real VEPs (Fig. 7), this feature is not the norm. Increasing
K makes the response less complicated in form, until it
resembles the shape of the applied input stimulus as
K exceeds 100 (Fig. 8). Virtually no stimulus-related
effect is seen in column 2 for any K value, although some

especially for larger values of Ka. Also, the peak-to-peak
amplitude during the first 500 ms poststimulus is much
larger than prestimulus. This suggests that the presentation of a single stimulus causes a phase reorganization
(synchronization) of the ongoing activity, and/or a damped sinusoidal response (ringing). This issue was explored
by investigating single trials. In Fig. 10 we present the
first five trials used to compute the averaged response for
Ka = 120 and K2 = 10 as shown in Fig. 9. A ringing
effect is immediately apparent, but a synchronization
effect can be observed as well. Specifically, the trials
appear to synchronize within 50 ms of the stimulus, and
start to desynchronize about 50 ms later.

A stimulus-related effect can be observed in column
2 if K~ is made about an order of magnitude larger
than K2, as shown in Fig. 9. Under those circumstances,
the averaged response resembles a damped sinusoid,

column model, using different model parameters for each
column and delays in the intercolumn branches, are
presented in Fig. 11. The two examples presented are
typical of the two kinds of VEPs produced by the model
when KI is roughly one order of magnitude larger than
K2. The increased latencies of N1 in the prefrontal columns (columns 2), as compared with the column
1 latency, are clearly visible. It should be observed that
the amplitude of N 2 in the prefrontal column depends
heavily on the values of the constants K1 and K2. For
relatively low values of K1 and Kz (1000 and 300, respectively), the VEP produced by the system is similar to the
damped sinusoidal wave already mentioned in the case of
a double-column model with no delay. For different
values of K1 and K 2 (such as 4000 and 100, respectively),
the system yields a new kind of VEP with a highamplitude N1, a very low-amplitude N 2 peak, and the

365
suggestion of a slow wave component typical of certain
real flash VEPs (upper panel of Fig. 7). Interestingly, this
slow wave component occurs in the column that does not
receive the primary visual stimulus.
Removing the delay produced results that were very
similar to those obtained for the model with two identical
columns (presented in Fig. 9).
4 Conclusions and discussion

The model for EP generation introduced in Jansen et al.
(1993) was explored in more detail and extended. A study
of the four-dimensional system parameter-space demonstrated that, when fed with random noise, five typical
outputs could be observed depending on the setting of
the parameter values: hypoactive noise for high values of
the inhibitory feedback, slow periodic activity similar to
that obtained in comatose patients (Chatrian 1990),
alpha activity, noisy alpha activity, and low-amplitude
high-frequency activity similar to beta activity for high
values of the excitatory feedback.
Coupling two identical single-column models, so
as to simulate the interactions between two columns
located in the visual cortex, produced in-phase oscillations. The phase locking remained, even for low values
of the intercolumn connectivity constants. Persistent
synchronization of neocortical activity may also be
observed in patients with bilateral pontine infarcts involving the tegmentum, for instance (Daly and Markand
1990).
A second simulation involving two different columns,
one representative of the visual and the other of the
prefrontal cortical areas, reproduced the alpha and beta
activities typically found over the visual and the prefrontal regions of the scalp.
The EP simulations suggest that the averaoed VEP
components typically seen during the first 100--200 ms
are primarily due to a combination of phase reorganization and the processing of the primary afferent activity.
In general, the results obtained with a double-column
model were not dramatically different from those produced by a single-column model (as presented in Jansen
et al. 1993). However, the addition of delays within the
intercolumn branches brought about a slow wave component following P1, not seen in single-column simulations, provided that K1 and K2 (i.e., the intercolumn
connectivity coefficients) were fairly large. Hence, cortical
interaction appears to be important in the generation of
later components.
It should be stressed that we do not imply that only
two cortical columns are involved in EP production. We
used a lumped parameter model of a cortical column and,
therefore, one model column could be taken to represent
the action of numerous actual cortical columns or even
a section of the cortex.
The model presented here suffers from a problem
common to all mathematical models, namely that a number of assumptions have been made in its derivation.
Consequently, our model should be viewed as just one of
the many possibilities as to how neuronal interactions

may give rise to EEG and EP. However, most of our
model parameters are related to architectural, neurochemical, and behavioral characteristics of cortical networks. Therefore, experimental verification of the model
might be possible, by comparing model output with the
actual EEG recorded under conditions where neuronal
behavior has been selectively altered through, for
example, administration of drugs.
The various counts of synapses we reviewed led to
different equations between the connectivity constants.
The most contentious of the ratios used to determine C is
C2/C 4 (equal to C1/C3).A qualitatively different outcome
of our simulation experiments could have been obtained
if a more accurate value of C2/C4 had been available.
However, an accurate synaptic count might be of little
value: the location and efficiency of the synapses can have
an influence on the global connectivity constants at least
as important as their actual number. Inhibitory neurons,
for instance, are much more likely to synapse near the cell
body of a pyramidal cell than are excitatory neurons
(Martin 1985), producing larger PSPs. This was accounted for in our model by selecting B > A (Eqs. 1 and
2). Also, it should be noted that the PSP constants A
and B can compensate for any bias in the values of
C2 and C4. Since the effect of varying A and B was
studied in the four-dimensional space exploration, we
can assume that a wide range of values of the ratio C2/C4
was explored.
In our experiments, the nonlinear potential-to-pulse
density functions of the three neurons included in the
pathways between visual and prefrontal areas were not
implemented. Also, the two single-column models were
coupled by adding the output of one column to the
excitatory feedback of the other. Although intercolumn
neurons are generally excitatory (Martin 1985), they can
synapse on inhibitory cells as well as excitatory ones.
Thus, an intercolumn reinforcement of the inhibitory
feedback loop is possible; this case was not dealt with in
our study.
We intend to improve our model along aforementioned lines. Also, we will increase the number of model
columns to replicate better the complex interactions between various brain regions when processing sensory
stimuli. We hope that such an expanded model will shed
light on the mechanism underlying the generation of very
late components, such as P300, which are often associated with cognition.

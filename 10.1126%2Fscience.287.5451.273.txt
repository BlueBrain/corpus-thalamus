A puzzling feature of the neocortex is the rich array of inhibitory interneurons.
Multiple neuron recordings revealed numerous electrophysiological-anatomical
subclasses of neocortical ␥-aminobutyric acid– ergic (GABAergic) interneurons
and three types of GABAergic synapses. The type of synapse used by each
interneuron to influence its neighbors follows three functional organizing principles. These principles suggest that inhibitory synapses could shape the impact
of different interneurons according to their specific spatiotemporal patterns of
activity and that GABAergic interneuron and synapse diversity may enable
combinatorial inhibitory effects in the neocortex.
The difficulty in understanding the organization
and function of the GABAergic system is due
to the large diversity of anatomically and physiologically distinct neurons (1–4). GABAergic
synaptic transmission in the neocortex has
mostly been studied with extracellular electrical
stimulation and in some cases by obtaining
paired recordings (2, 5, 6). We recorded from a
large number of interneuron connections and
explored whether the nature of the synaptic
outflow from interneurons could reveal the way
in which the GABAergic system is organized
and functions. Multiple whole-cell patch-clamp
recordings were used to characterize key properties of synapses formed by anatomically and
physiologically distinct interneurons: (i) the kinetics of GABAergic receptors used at synapses, (ii) the number and precise locations of
putative synapses forming a connection, (iii) the
absolute strength of connections, and (iv) the
particular temporal dynamics of synaptic transmission that arise because of an interaction
between the rate of neurotransmitter release
[depending on probability of release (P) and the
frequency of stimulation], the rate of recovery
from release (synaptic depression), and the rate
of recovery from facilitation of release (7, 8).
Temporal dynamics of synapses may be particularly important because this could determine
the temporal impact on target neurons.

postsynaptic pyramidal neurons according to
their bipolar or multipolar dendritic appearance
as well as their oval or round somata. Neurons

GABAergic connections. There were more than
240 GABAergic connections, of which 179
were studied in detail (10). The GABAergic
nature of the connections was routinely verified
by determining the reversal potential of the
synaptic response (11) and, in some cases, also
by applying the GABA-A receptor antagonist,
bicuculline. Neurons were filled with biocytin
to allow staining and anatomical three-dimensional (3D) computer reconstructions of the
physiologically characterized connections (9,
12, 13).
Synaptic connections were examined by
eliciting short trains of precisely timed action
potentials (APs) in interneurons across a range
of physiologically relevant discharge frequencies (5 to 70 Hz), followed by a recovery test
response (RTR) 500 ms later. The inhibitory
postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) or the currents (IPSCs), or both, were recorded (14).
The average synaptic response to this stimulation protocol allows the extraction of the
basic parameters of the synaptic connection
with a model of dynamic synaptic transmission (9) (U, equivalent to average P; F, the
time constant to recover from facilitation;
D, the time constant to recover from depression; A, the absolute strength of the
connection, which is equivalent to the product of quantal size and number of release
sites) as well as the statistics of the transmission [coefficient of variation (CV) and
failures of transmission].
GABAergic synaptic responses were highly

Table 1. Summary of GABAergic synaptic properties in neocortical layers II to IV. Occurrence: Synaptic
classification is according to facilitated (F1, Ͼ10%), depressed (F2, Ͼ10%), and recovered (F3) RTR. This
classification is verified for 65/65 cases. Synaptic model parameters: Model fit of connections with too few trials,
test frequencies, small responses, or high CVs produced high-fit errors (29). For F2, modeling was performed on
a random subset because of large data volume. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) on log-transformed raw data (F:D
ratios), F ϭ 274, with (2,62) df, P ϭ 0.0001. Fisher’s multiple comparison (at ␣ ϭ 0.05) showed that the groups
differ significantly from each other (all three pairwise, P Ͻ 0.01). Synaptic release statistics: Failure and CV
analyses were carried out only in connections with more than 50 trials. Failures are defined as events with
amplitudes smaller than 1.59 pA or 60 ␮V. CV (SD/mean of 80 to 150 traces) values were overestimated by
2.74 Ϯ 1.97% in VC (n ϭ 13) and by 0.78 Ϯ 0.77% in CC (n ϭ 13). Failure rate and CV of F1 connections are
significantly different from those of F2 and F3 (P Ͻ 0.01). Student’s t tests were performed to determine
statistical differences. Decay time constant (DTC) of IPSCs was estimated as single exponentials, because of
multiple distributed release sites. Chord conductance (G1) was determined as slope of line fit through
amplitudes of first responses and intersection at the reversal potential (negligible rectification detected). Gmax ϭ
G1/U. Per synapse conductance (Gsyn ) ϭ Gmax /anatomically estimated number of synapses or binomially calculated number. Gmax for F2 connections was significantly different from that for F1 and F3 connections (P Ͻ
0.02). Synaptic numbers and distances: Anatomical n was estimated as in (12). Binomial n ϭ 1 Ϫ P/CV2P, where
P is the probability of neurotransmitter release and n is the binomial number of release sites. P was replaced by
U derived from the model of nonlinear synaptic transmission. Steady-state electrotonic distances computed
according to (7). All values shown above are mean Ϯ SD, except for F:D and D:F ratios, which are mean Ϯ SEM.

diverse in terms of their temporal dynamics:
The RTRs were either facilitated, depressed, or
unchanged as compared with the first response
in the AP train, suggesting that GABAergic
synapses differ in the extent to which they
undergo synaptic depression and facilitation. F
was ϳ10 times as great as D at connections
with facilitated RTRs, D was ϳ40 times as
great as F at connections with depressed RTRs,
and F and D were similar at connections where
RTRs were unchanged (Table 1). The F:D
ratios of these three types of synaptic responses
were statistically distinct from each other with
no overlap in their distributions. We refer to
these three types of responses as F1 to F3,
respectively.
Figure 1A shows a reconstruction of an F1
GABAergic connection between two interneurons, and Fig. 1B shows the facilitating synaptic
response recorded from this connection. Nine
putative synapses were identified (Table 1). F1
connections typically displayed the lowest U
values, the highest failure rates of all connections, and, accordingly, the highest CVs for the
amplitudes of the first response in the train
(Table 1). The low U values are required for
expression of synaptic facilitation. Both synaptic facilitation and depression are engaged during the train, but facilitation persists longer than
depression (Fig. 1C), resulting in a facilitated
RTR and increased amplitudes of responses as
the frequency of the presynaptic APs increases
(Fig. 1D). Other parameters, such as the conductance per synapse (Gsyn) and the kinetics of
the synaptic current obtained from voltageclamp experiments, were not significantly different from those of the F2 and F3 GABAergic
connections (Table 1). F1 synaptic connections
appeared to be mediated only by GABA-A
receptors (Fig. 1E).
F2 GABAergic synaptic connections were
the most common type encountered (Fig. 2A).
They displayed depression at low frequencies
(Fig. 2B, 5-Hz trace), but prominent facilitation

(18) for BCs was 200.4 Ϯ 31.6 ␮m (six
connections), and the mean axonal segment
length (ASL) was 47.2 Ϯ 11.5 ␮m (18). BCs
also formed a high fraction (at least 19%) of

at higher frequencies (50-Hz trace). F2 synapses are characterized by depressed RTRs (30Hz trace). Not only was the RTR depressed
compared with the first response but also compared with the last response in the train (30-Hz
trace, arrow). Naı¨vely, it would appear that
synapses become more depressed during the
recovery period. This behavior, however, is due
to brief facilitation of responses during the train,
whereas facilitation is absent by the time of the
RTR. Because of this brief facilitation and the
longer lasting depression, activation of these
synapses can effectively, but only transiently,
block AP discharge (Fig. 2C). Facilitation was
not always observed because U was too high to
allow its expression. Nevertheless, the apparently negative, nonexistent, or unrealistically
slow recovery from synaptic depression (as estimated from the RTR) predicted that these
synapses were F2 type synapses; this was confirmed by lowering extracellular [Ca2ϩ] (15),
which lowers U (n ϭ 4; Fig. 2D).
The number of release sites estimated with a
binomial analysis was considerably higher than
the number of putative synapses estimated anatomically (Table 1). Despite lower U values,
F2 connections also displayed lower CV values
than F3 connections. Because most errors in the
anatomical (12, 13) and binomial estimates
would increase this discrepancy, we propose
that F2 synapses use multiple release sites. Indeed, electron microscopic evidence does support multiple release sites at some GABAergic
synapses in the neocortex (13, 16). The physiological and anatomical properties of F1 and F3
connections do not suggest that these types of
connections use multiple release sites. As for F1
and F3 connections, only GABA-A receptors
appear to mediate the transmission (Fig. 2E).
The third type of GABAergic connection
(Fig. 3A) not only remained in a facilitated
state briefly but also recovered from synaptic
depression rapidly. This results in equal amplitude synaptic responses at low frequencies
(Fig. 3B; 10-Hz trace). However, at high
frequencies, facilitation is revealed if U is
sufficiently low to permit the dynamic range
required to observe facilitation (Fig. 3B; 70Hz trace). Regardless of U and frequency, the
synapses recover completely by the time of
the RTR. F3 connections displayed the highest U values, indicating that these connections reliably produce the largest GABA output during high-frequency stimulation.

BCs (116.2 Ϯ 29.3 ␮m; Fig. 4, inset). SBCs
also formed some synapses onto somata of
both pyramidal cells as well as interneurons
(at least 5%). Martinotti cells (MCs,13/61,
21.3%) (20) exhibited distinctive axonal arborizations with collaterals reaching layer I
and contacting tuft dendrites of PCs (30% of
putative synapses). The angle of axonal
branches in MCs (80.7 Ϯ 5.1°; n ϭ 7) was
much wider than in BCs and SBCs (BC,
66.7 Ϯ 6.2°; SBC, 73.1 Ϯ 6.2°). Bitufted
cells (BTCs, 10/61, 16.4%) (21) gave rise to
primary dendrites emerging on opposite poles
and exhibited distinct axonal arborization.
The wide angled (77.2 Ϯ 4.3°; n ϭ 7) and
curvy collaterals innervated primarily the
dendritic regions of target cells.
A fifth anatomical class of interneuron
frequently encountered (17/61; 27.9%; mostly in layers II and III) did not fit the set of
properties of typical interneurons previously
described [but see (22)]. This class of interneuron seems to be a hybrid of SBCs and

276

BCs, because they exhibit a local nest of
axons around the somata and long extending
axons. Like BCs and SBCs, they form synapses on somata (at least 16%) and exhibit
similar axonal branch angles (68.9 Ϯ 5.4°;
n ϭ 7). They differ from BCs in their ASD
(less than half the value, 99.1 Ϯ 21.4 ␮m)
and from SBCs in their ASL (nearly 50%
longer, 47.5 Ϯ 10.2 ␮m) (Fig. 4, inset). We
name this interneuron a “nest basket cell”
(NBC). NBCs exhibit the richest diversity of
electrophysiological subtypes.

Electrophysiological Diversity of
GABAergic Interneurons
Although interneurons may display many types
of responses in vivo (23), under controlled conditions in vitro, differences in biophysical properties manifest in distinct electrophysiological
responses. The physiology of pyramidal neurons in layers II to IV was relatively uniform
and has previously been described as “regular
spiking” (Fig. 5) (4). However, for neocortical
interneurons, the usual classification of “fast

spiking,” “bursting,” and “regular spiking” (4)
was too vague to encompass the diversity of
responses. The electrophysiological responses
presented as three main classes and eight distinct subclasses, many of which have not been
reported previously. We began with a broad
classification into nonaccommodating (45/91,
49.4%, NAC), accommodating (34/91, 37.4%,
AC), and stuttering cells (12/91, 13.2%, STUT)
(24). These major classes were further subdivided into three subclasses according to (i) the
presence of a burst response at the onset of the
step depolarization (b-NAC, b-AC, b-STUT),
(ii) a delay of variable duration until the onset
of AP discharge (d-NAC, d-AC; probably due
to the presence of transient outward Kϩ currents) (25), and (iii) the absence of either a burst
or a delay in the response, referred to as a
classical response (c-NAC, c-AC, c-STUT).
Delayed onset discharge has previously been
reported definitively only for neurogliaform interneurons in layers II and III (24), but we
found this class of response also for several
other anatomically distinct interneurons.

A Synapse Mapping Principle
After establishing the anatomical and electrophysiological classes of interneurons recorded,
we addressed the organizing principles that determine the types of synapses formed by each
different class of interneuron onto pyramidal
cells. Interneurons defined solely on anatomical
or electrophysiological grounds formed different types of synapses (Table 2). However, subclassifying the anatomically defined interneurons according to their electrophysiology revealed 14 distinct subclasses of interneurons
and perfect mapping of synapse types (Table 2)
(26, 27). These data show that specific interneurons form specific types of synapses on
pyramidal cells. The synaptic organization onto
interneurons was also examined and some connections defined. As for PCs, we found that
different types of synapses formed onto different anatomically or electrophysiologically defined interneurons, suggesting that inter-interneuron synapses probably also obey the same
mapping rules.

A Presynaptic-Postsynaptic Interaction
Principle
The finding that various classes of interneurons can establish different types of synapses

onto the same class of target neuron (pyramidal neurons) indicates that the postsynaptic
neuron alone cannot dictate the type of synapse. We confirmed this by recording convergent innervation onto the same pyramidal
neuron from different classes of interneurons
in three experiments (Fig. 6A). By recording
divergent connections, we also found that the
same GABAergic axon can form distinct
types of synapses onto different classes of
target neurons (n ϭ 3) (Fig. 6B). These data
indicate that an interaction between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons is involved
in formation of the type of synapse.

A Synaptic Homogeneity Principle
Glutamatergic synapses display differential
synaptic transmission and obey a target specific rule in forming synapses (5, 7), but their
temporal dynamics of transmission, even
onto the same class of target neuron, are
highly heterogeneous (7). The GABAergic
system is different, because interneurons
form synapses with virtually identical temporal dynamics onto different targets of the
same class (Fig. 6C). The connections differed in A, but U, D, and F were homogenous
as could be predicted by simply normalizing

each trace to the maximum amplitude—the
traces overlay perfectly (Fig. 6D). In all of 22
examples of divergent connections onto two
or three pyramidal neurons and involving all
synapse types (F1 to F3), homogeneity was
observed (Fig. 6E).
The synaptic homogeneity principle also applies across different classes of target neurons
(Fig. 6F; n ϭ 3), indicating that GABAergic
interneurons are able to “select” a group of
neurons to establish synapses with homogenous
temporal dynamics. We term such a selected
group of neurons a “GABA group.” Because
the same interneuron can also produce different
types of synapses, each interneuron can form
multiple GABA groups. All pyramidal neurons
in layers II to IV are expected to be in the same
GABA group together with a subset of interneurons. Other GABA groups could be composed of other classes of interneurons, spiny
stellate cells, pyramidal cells in layers V and VI
in the same column, and neurons in neighboring columns.

Summary
First, we found that each class of interneuron
forms synapses with highly specific temporal
dynamics onto a given target neuron (synapse mapping principle). This suggests that
GABAergic synapses constrain the functional
impact of different interneurons according to
their precise timing of action potentials. Second, we found that the phenotypic nature of
both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons is
involved in generating the type of synapse
formed (interaction principle). This suggests
that combinatorial interactions between two
neurons could maximize synaptic diversity.
Third, we found that interneurons form synapses with some identical properties onto
neighboring target neurons (synapse homogeneity principle). This principle applies to neurons within “selected” groups. We propose that
GABAergic interneurons are able to “smell
out” functionally related neurons, even of different phenotypic classes, and that such
“GABA groups” represent the most elementary, functionally related group of neurons identified so far in the neocortex.

Rutile-Bearing Refractory
Eclogites: Missing Link Between
Continents and Depleted
Mantle
Roberta L. Rudnick, Matthias Barth, Ingo Horn,
William F. McDonough
A mass imbalance exists in Earth for Nb, Ta, and possibly Ti: continental crust
and depleted mantle both have subchondritic Nb/Ta, Nb/La, and Ti/Zr, which
requires the existence of an additional reservoir with superchondritic ratios,
such as refractory eclogite produced by slab melting. Trace element compositions of minerals in xenolithic eclogites derived from cratonic lithospheric
mantle show that rutile dominates the budget of Nb and Ta in the eclogites and
imparts a superchondritic Nb/Ta, Nb/La, and Ti/Zr to the whole rocks. About
1 to 6 percent by weight of eclogite is required to solve the mass imbalance
in the silicate Earth, and this reservoir must have an Nb concentration Ն 2 parts
per million, Nb/La Ն 1.2, and Nb/Ta between 19 and 37—values that overlap
those of the xenolithic eclogites. As the mass of eclogite in the continental
lithosphere is significantly lower than this, much of this material may reside in
the lower mantle, perhaps as deep as the core-mantle boundary.
The elements Ti, Zr, Nb, Ta, and rare earth
elements (REE) are refractory and lithophile
and therefore should exist in chondritic relative
abundances in the silicate Earth. Continental

ridge basalt (MORB) source] generally are assumed to be geochemically complementary reservoirs within the Earth. However, both reservoirs have subchondritic Nb/La (1– 4). A similar observation is made about Nb/Ta ratios.
These elements share the same valence state
(ϩ5) and have matching atomic radii (5), and
they are thought to be geochemically inseparable. However, recent analyses (6) have demon-

strated that Nb/Ta ratios are subchondritic in
MORB and near-ridge seamounts (7–9), ocean
island basalts (OIB) (7, 10), and the upper
continental crust (11, 12). Because Nb is more
incompatible than Ta in clinopyroxene during
mantle melting (13), the DM and the source of
OIB should have even lower Nb/Ta ratios. A
third element ratio that also may not mass balance in Earth is Ti/Zr. The continental crust,
MORB, and OIB have Ti/Zr ratios below 115,
the chondritic ratio (1). However, because Zr is
more incompatible than Ti (13), partial melts
should have lower Ti/Zr than their source regions and the mass imbalance in this case is not
clear. The DM and OIB sources could have
chondritic or even superchondritic Ti/Zr [as
massif peridotites do (14)]. Nevertheless, the
subchondritic Ti/Zr in MORB and continental
crust suggests that another reservoir exists that
is Ti enriched relative to Zr.
The above observations require the existence of an additional reservoir that contains
appreciable Nb, Ta, and Ti with superchondritic Nb/La, Nb/Ta, and Ti/Zr—features
that, until now, have not been observed in
common igneous and metamorphic rocks
(15). McDonough (1) suggested that refractory, rutile-bearing eclogite may satisfy the
mass balance requirements for Ti, Nb, and Ta
in the silicate Earth. Here we show that
eclogites, sampled in xenoliths from cratonic
kimberlites, do indeed have the requisite
trace element compositions to satisfy this
mass imbalance.
Rutile (TiO2) is a common accessory
phase in metamorphic rocks and it can have

Functional differences in Na¤ channel gating between
fast_spiking interneurones and principal neurones of rat
hippocampus

1. GABAergic interneurones differ from glutamatergic principal neurones in their ability to
discharge high-frequency trains of action potentials without adaptation. To examine whether
Na¤ channel gating contributed to these differences, Na¤ currents were recorded in nucleated
patches from interneurones (dentate gyrus basket cells, BCs) and principal neurones (CA1
pyramidal cells, PCs) of rat hippocampal slices.
2. The voltage dependence of Na¤ channel activation in BCs and PCs was similar. The slope
factors of the activation curves, fitted with Boltzmann functions raised to the third power,
were 11·5 and 11·8 mV, and the mid-point potentials were −25·1 and −23·9 mV,
respectively.
3. Whereas the time course of Na¤ channel activation (−30 to +40 mV) was similar, the
deactivation kinetics (−100 to −40 mV) were faster in BCs than in PCs (tail current decay
time constants, 0·13 and 0·20 ms, respectively, at −40 mV).
4. Na¤ channels in BCs and PCs differed in the voltage dependence of inactivation. The slope
factors of the steady-state inactivation curves fitted with Boltzmann functions were 6·7 and
10·7 mV, and the mid-point potentials were −58·3 and −62·9 mV, respectively.
5. The onset of Na¤ channel inactivation at −55 mV was slower in BCs than in PCs; the
inactivation time constants were 18·6 and 9·3 ms, respectively. At more positive potentials
the differences in inactivation onset were smaller.
6. The time course of recovery of Na¤ channels from inactivation induced by a 30 ms pulse was
fast and mono-exponential (ô = 2·0 ms at −120 mV) in BCs, whereas it was slower and biexponential in PCs (ôÔ = 2·0 ms and ôµ = 133 ms; amplitude contribution of the slow
component, 15%).
7. We conclude that Na¤ channels of BCs and PCs differ in gating properties that contribute to
the characteristic action potential patterns of the two types of neurones.
Cortical neurones differ markedly in their intrinsic action
potential patterns (reviewed by Connors & Gutnick, 1990).
Glutamatergic principal neurones in the hippocampus and
neocortex are either regularly spiking or intrinsically
bursting and show adaptation during sustained current
injection (Madison & Nicoll, 1984; Stafstrom, Schwindt &
Crill, 1984). In contrast, several types of GABAergic interneurones are fast spiking and generate trains of several
hundred action potentials per second without any adaptation
(McCormick, Connors, Lighthall & Prince, 1985; Lacaille &
Williams, 1990; Han, Buhl, Lorinczi & Somogyi, 1993).
This diversity in the intrinsic firing patterns of neurones is
of critical importance for the operation of the entire
neuronal network, because it shapes the transformation of
synaptic input signals into action potential output signals.

The determinants of this heterogeneity in intrinsic firing
patterns of cortical neurones are not entirely understood.
The basic functional properties of voltage-gated Na¤ channels
expressed in principal neurones have been studied (Sah,
Gibb & Gage, 1988; Fleidervish, Friedman & Gutnick, 1996),
but those of Na¤ channels in fast-spiking interneurones have
not been investigated. Previous studies indicated that
voltage-gated K¤ channels expressed in principal neurones
and interneurones differ in their functional properties
(Storm, 1990; Zhang & McBain, 1995a, b). K¤ channels in
interneurones activate and deactivate rapidly, but inactivate
only very slowly (Zhang & McBain, 1995a, b); these gating
properties will support the sustained generation of action
potentials with high frequency in interneurones. In addition,
both the distribution of the different channels and the

structure of the dendritic tree influence the discharge
pattern of cortical neurones (Mainen & Sejnowski, 1996).
To explore the possibility that specific characteristics of Na¤
channel gating contribute to the differences in spiking
patterns, we compared Na¤ channels of a fast-spiking
GABAergic interneurone (the dentate gyrus basket cell)
with those of a regularly spiking or bursting principal
neurone (the CA1 pyramidal cell). Analysis of the very rapid
gating of Na¤ channels requires adequate voltage-clamp
control of the neuronal membrane; we have therefore used
the nucleated patch technique (Sather, Dieudonne,
MacDonald & Ascher, 1992; Terlau, Shon, Grilley, Stocker,
Stuhmer & Olivera, 1996) to record macroscopic Na¤
currents under almost ideal voltage-clamp conditions. Our
results show that Na¤ channels in the two cell types differ in
their functional properties, particularly regarding the
inactivation process. These differences contribute to the
characteristic action potential patterns of the two classes of
neurones.

METHODS

Cell identification and isolation of nucleated patches

Nine- to 16-day-old Wistar rats were killed by decapitation
(according to local regulations). Transverse 300 ìm thick
hippocampal slices were cut from the brains using a vibratome
(Dosaka, Kyoto, Japan). Basket cells in the dentate gyrus (BCs) and
pyramidal neurones in the CA1 subfield (PCs) were identified
visually using infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC)
videomicroscopy (Stuart, Dodt & Sakmann, 1993) and on the basis
of their characteristic action potential pattern following sustained
current injection (Lacaille & Williams, 1990; Han et al. 1993). Patch
pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass tubing (2·0 mm outer
diameter, 0·5 mm wall thickness; Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany),
coated with Sylgard (184; Dow Corning), and heat polished directly
before use. Neurones were approached with patch pipettes under
visual control; positive pressure was applied to the pipette during
this procedure (Stuart et al. 1993). Following seal formation, access
to the cell interior was obtained by applying a brief pulse of
suction. The resistance of patch pipettes (when filled with internal
solution) ranged from 2 to 5 MÙ, and the series resistance in the
whole-cell configuration ranged from 4 to 15 MÙ. Only neurones
with initial resting potentials negative to −55 mV were used. The
action potential pattern of BCs was tested within 10 s after
obtaining access to the cell interior. To isolate nucleated patches
(Sather et al. 1992), negative pressure (5—15 kPa) was applied and
the patch pipette was withdrawn slowly. The input resistance of the
nucleated patches ranged from 2 to 5 GÙ. Their shape was
spherical, and the diameter was 3·5—5·0 ìm, corresponding to a
surface membrane area of 38·5—78·5 ìmÂ.

Recording of Na¤ currents

Patch currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A amplifier
(Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA). Signals were filtered at
10 kHz (or 50 kHz for deactivation) using the built-in 4-pole lowpass Bessel filter. Capacitive transients were minimized by
maintaining the bath at the lowest possible level, and were further
reduced by the capacitive compensation circuit of the amplifier. As
the mean peak amplitude of the Na¤ currents at 0 mV was only
202 ± 27 pA for BCs and 179 ± 12 pA for PCs, series resistance
compensation was not used. A CED 1401plus interface (CED,

J. Physiol. 505.3

Cambridge, UK) connected to a personal computer was used for
stimulus generation and data acquisition. The sampling frequency
was 20 or 40 kHz. In some experiments, the voltage pulses were
low-pass filtered prior to the amplifier input (filter time constant,
5 ìs) to reduce the amplitude of the capacitive transients.
We estimate that, in the worst case (series resistance (R) = 15 MÙ,
membrane area (A) = 78·5 ìmÂ), the membrane of a nucleated
patch follows a command voltage step with an overall time constant
of approximately 13 ìs, composed of: (1) the time constant of the
resistance—capacitance equivalent circuit (ô = RCmA = 8 ìs), where
Cm is the specific membrane capacitance (0·7 ìF cm¦Â), and (2) the
time constant of the filter at the amplifier input, 5 ìs. Further
distortion of the signals arises from residual capacitive components
and from the effect of the filter at the amplifier output (10—90%
rise time: 7 or 34 ìs, depending on the filter setting; Colquhoun &
Sigworth, 1995). Considering these factors, sample points 25—100 ìs
following a voltage step were excluded from the fitting of the time
course and were blanked in the figures.
Nucleated patches were held at −90 mV. A 50 ms pulse to
−120 mV was applied before each test pulse to obtain complete
recovery from fast inactivation. K¤ channels were blocked by
external TEA¤ and internal Cs¤. Ca¥ channels appeared to be
largely absent from nucleated patches, because 100 ìÒ external
Cd¥ did not have any effect on the recorded currents. Leakage and
capacitive currents were subtracted on-line using a PÏ−4 protocol
(four negative correction pulses, amplitude 1Ï4 of that of the test
pulse). Alternatively, Na¤ currents were isolated by off-line
subtraction of currents recorded in the absence from those recorded
in the presence of 1 ìÒ external tetrodotoxin (TTX; Sigma). TTX
subtraction was performed in the majority of experiments; it was
done for all pulse protocols with test pulses to potentials ü +10 mV
(at these potentials a residual outward current resistant to external
TEA¤ and Cd¥ and internal Cs¤ appeared). Traces in the
figures were TTX subtracted and filtered digitally (Gaussian
characteristics, 3 or 5 kHz); they represent single sweeps or
averages of up to eighteen sweeps. Test pulses were applied every
4—5 s. During the course of the experiments, the Na¤ current
amplitude was stable within ±20% of the initial value, otherwise
the patch was discarded. No correction for liquid junction potentials
(approximately 4 mV) was made. All recordings were performed at
room temperature (22—24°C). The data included in this study were
obtained from 121 nucleated patches (47 BC patches, 74 PC
patches).

Solutions and chemicals

Slices were continuously superfused with physiological extracellular
solution containing (mÒ): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO×, 2·5 KCl, 1·25
NaHµPOÚ, 2 CaClµ, 1 MgClµ, 25 glucose, bubbled with 95% Oµ and
5% COµ. Tetraethylammonium chloride (20 mÒ; TEA; Merck) and,
in some experiments, 100 ìÒ CdClµ were added to the bath solution
to block voltage-gated K¤ channels and Ca¥ channels, respectively.
Pipettes were filled with Cs¤-rich internal solution, containing
(mÒ): 140 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 2 MgClµ, 2 NaµATP, 10 Hepes, pH
adjusted to 7·3 with CsOH. In some experiments 2 mÒ TEA was
added to the internal solution. In experiments designed to measure
the reversal potentials of the Na¤ currents, internal solutions
containing 132 mÒ CsCl plus 8 mÒ NaCl, or 60 mÒ CsCl plus
80 mÒ NaCl (Fig. 1) were used. All chemicals were from Merck or
Sigma.

Analysis

The time courses of deactivation, onset of inactivation, and
recovery from inactivation were fitted either with a single
exponential or with the sum of two exponentials, using a non-linear

J. Physiol. 505.3

least-squares algorithm. The activation time constant was
determined by fitting Na¤ currents (range, 0—4·5 ms) with the
function:
f = {1 − exp[−(t − ät)Ïôm]}Åexp(−tÏôh) for t > ät, f = 0 for t û ät,
where t is time, ät is a delay, ôm is the activation time constant, and
ôh the inactivation time constant (see Jonas, 1989). The activation
curve was obtained from the peak current—voltage relation using
the Goldman—Hodgkin—Katz equation (Hille, 1992) and was fitted
with a Boltzmann function raised to the third power:
f = 1Ï{1 + exp[−(V − V½)Ïk] }Å,
where V is membrane potential, V½ is the potential at which the
value of the Boltzmann function is 0·5, and k is the slope factor.
The steady-state inactivation (hþ) curve was fitted with a simple
Boltzmann function:
f = 1Ï{1 + exp[(V − V½)Ïk] }.
All numerical values given denote means ± s.e.m. Error bars in
figures (representing s.e.m.) were plotted only when they exceeded
the respective symbol size. The data points shown in the
figures and the mean values given in the text and Table 1 were
obtained by pooling data from different patches. Individual
experiments were also analysed separately to test statistical
significance and to obtain the standard errors; when these results
were averaged, the mean values were very similar to the results

obtained by fitting the pooled data. Statistical significance was
assessed using Student’s t test (unpaired samples, two-sided) at the
significance level (P) indicated.

RESULTS

Voltage dependence of Na¤ channel activation

To address whether differences in Na¤ channel gating
contributed to the marked differences in spiking pattern
between dentate gyrus basket cells and CA1 pyramidal
neurones of rat hippocampus, we examined Na¤ currents in
the two classes of cells using the nucleated patch
configuration. The voltage dependence of Na¤ channel
activation was studied using test pulses to membrane
potentials between −80 and +40 mV (Fig. 1).
Representative recordings of Na¤ currents with 84 mÒ
internal Na¤ are shown in Fig. 1A and B. Under these
conditions, the amplitude of the Na¤ inward current was
maximal at approximately −20 mV in both types of
neurones. At more positive voltages, the Na¤ currents became
smaller and finally reversed; the interpolated reversal
potentials were +15·6 ± 1·4 mV in BC patches (n = 3) and
+15·0 ± 0·5 mV in PC patches (n = 4). With 12 and 4 mÒ

extrapolation were more positive, +63·6 ± 4 mV and
+70·0 ± 4·3 mV in BC patches (n = 7) and +60·6 ± 5·5 mV
and +75·1 ± 4·0 mV in PC patches (n = 9), respectively.

These results were consistent with the predictions of the
Nernst equation for a Na¤-selective channel.
To obtain Na¤ channel activation curves, the Na¤
permeability at a given test pulse potential was calculated

from the respective peak current amplitude using the
Goldman—Hodgkin—Katz equation (Hille, 1992). Permeability was then normalized to the maximal value and
plotted against test pulse potential (Fig. 1C). The activation
curves for BC and PC patches were similar, and fits with
Boltzmann functions raised to the third power gave almost
identical values for both the mid-point potentials
(−25·1 ± 0·9 and −23·9 ± 0·9 mV, respectively; P > 0·2)
and the slope factors (11·5 ± 0·7 and 11·8 ± 0·8 mV; n = 8

results indicate that the voltage dependence of activation of
Na¤ channels expressed in BCs and PCs was similar.

to potentials between −100 and −40 mV. Analysis of tail
currents following the brief pulses (Fig. 2C and D) indicated
that the time course of Na¤ channel deactivation differed
between the two types of neurones (Fig. 2E). The value of
the deactivation time constant at −40 mV, for example, was
0·134 ± 0·013 ms (n = 5) in BC patches, whereas it was
significantly larger (0·201 ± 0·015 ms, n = 6; P < 0·01) in
PC patches. On average, the deactivation time constant of
PC Na¤ channels was 1·57-fold larger than that of BC Na¤
channels (P < 0·05 for 5 out of 7 potentials). These results
indicate that Na¤ channels expressed in BCs deactivate more
rapidly than those expressed in PCs.

The time course of activation of Na¤ channels was
investigated using test pulses to potentials ranging from
−30 to +40 mV. In both BC and PC patches, the rise of the
Na¤ current was sigmoidal, and could be well fitted with an
exponential function raised to the third power and shifted
with respect to the onset of the pulse by a small delay
(Fig. 2A and B). The time constants of activation became
smaller with increasing voltage, and their values were
similar for the two types of neurones over the range of
membrane potentials tested (Fig. 2E). The activation time
constant at −20 mV, for instance, was 0·16 ± 0·020 ms for
BC patches (n = 6) and 0·16 ± 0·023 ms for PC patches
(n = 8; P > 0·5).
The time course of deactivation of Na¤ channels was
investigated using a 300 ìs pulse to 0 mV followed by a step

A marked difference between BC and PC Na¤ channels was
observed in the voltage dependence of steady-state
inactivation (hþ), measured using prepulses to membrane
potentials between −120 and −30 mV (Fig. 3). In both
types of neurones the inactivation curves were well
described by Boltzmann functions. The mid-point potential
of the inactivation curve was −58·3 ± 0·8 mV in BC patches
(n = 11), whereas it was more negative (−62·9 ± 1·7 mV) in
PC patches (n = 17; P < 0·05). The slope factor of the
inactivation curve was significantly different between the
two classes of cells; the mean value was 6·7 ± 0·5 mV in BC
patches, whereas it was 1·6-fold larger (10·7 ± 0·9 mV) in
PC patches (P < 0·005; Fig. 3C and Table 1). These results
show that the voltage dependence of the inactivation process
is significantly steeper for BC Na¤ channels than for PC Na¤
channels.

Time course of onset of inactivation

Na¤ channels expressed in BCs and PCs also differed in the
kinetics of inactivation onset during test pulses to
potentials between −30 and +40 mV (Fig. 4). The time
course of inactivation onset was mono-exponential in almost
all BC patches (16 out of 16 at −20 mV) and in the majority
of PC patches (14 out of 21 at −20 mV; see Howe & Ritchie,
1992). In five PC patches, however, the inactivation onset
was slightly better fitted with the sum of two exponentials
at some voltages, and in two PC patches it was clearly biexponential at all potentials. These two PC patches were not
included in the analysis of inactivation kinetics.
The inactivation time constants decreased with increasing
membrane potential in both BCs and PCs, but their values
differed between the two classes of neurones (Fig. 4C). The
inactivation time constant at −20 mV, for example, was
1·34 ± 0·14 ms in BC patches (n = 16) and 0·84 ± 0·01 ms
in PC patches (n = 19; P < 0·01). On average, the values of
the inactivation time constant were 1·49-fold larger in BC

J. Physiol. 505.3

than in PC patches over the range of membrane potentials
investigated (P < 0·05 for 5 out of 10 potentials).
As the differences in inactivation time constant between the
two types of neurones tended to be larger at more negative
voltages (Fig. 4C), we extended the analysis to potentials
that did not activate measurable Na¤ currents, using a
protocol with prepulses of increasing duration (Fig. 5). The
onset of inactivation of Na¤ channels at −55 mV was
described by a single exponential function in both classes of
neurones. The time constant was 18·6 ± 4·2 ms in BC
patches (n = 6), whereas it was 9·3 ± 1·0 ms in PC patches
(n = 7; P < 0·05; Fig. 5C and Table 1). These results show
that the onset of inactivation is significantly slower for BC
Na¤ channels than for PC Na¤ channels and that the
difference becomes larger as the threshold potential for spike
initiation is approached.

Recovery from inactivation

The time course of recovery of Na¤ channels from
inactivation was investigated using double-pulse protocols,

consisting of a pulse of either 30 or 300 ms duration to 0 mV
that completely inactivated the channels, followed, at
different time intervals, by a second pulse used to measure
the extent of recovery from inactivation (Fig. 6). Na¤
channels in BC patches recovered completely from
inactivation within less than 10 ms at −120 mV, independent
of the duration of the conditioning pulse (Fig. 6A and C).
The time course of recovery was mono-exponential; the
time constant was 2·0 ms for the 30 ms conditioning pulse
and 2·7 ms for the 300 ms pulse (n = 13 and n = 3,
respectively; Fig. 6C and Table 1). In contrast, Na¤ channels
in PCs did not recover completely from inactivation within
10 ms at this potential (Fig. 6B). The time course of
recovery was bi-exponential; for 30 ms conditioning pulses
the time constants were 2·0 and 133 ms, respectively, and
the amplitude contribution of the slow component was 15%
(n = 8—14; Fig. 6D and Table 1). For 300 ms conditioning
pulses, the time constant of the fast component was almost
identical (2·6 ms), but the time constant of the slow
component was slower (351 ms) and its amplitude
contribution increased to 24 % (n = 4; P < 0·01). Na¤
currents evoked by a series of nine pulses to 0 mV (30 ms
duration), separated by pulses to −120 mV (12 ms duration),
showed an almost constant amplitude in BC patches, but a
decreasing amplitude in PC patches (Table 1). These results

indicate that BC Na¤ channels recover from inactivation
very rapidly, whereas PC Na¤ channels show a more complex
time course of recovery that extends over hundreds of
milliseconds.

DISCUSSION

To investigate voltage-gated Na¤ channels of neurones in rat
brain slices, we used the nucleated patch configuration
(Sather et al. 1992), which provides almost ideal voltageclamp conditions and partly preserves the intracellular
environment. We show that Na¤ channels expressed in
GABAergic interneurones of the hippocampus differ from
those in glutamatergic principal neurones in their functional
properties. Whereas the differences in the activation process
were confined to a faster deactivation time course of BC Na¤
channels at negative voltages, several differences were
observed in the inactivation process. BC Na¤ channels
differed from PC Na¤ channels in the shape of the steadystate inactivation curve, which was steeper and shifted to
more positive potentials, and in the kinetics of inactivation,
which showed a slower onset and a faster recovery.

(this paper) were considerably different from those reported
previously for enzymatically dissociated neurones of the
guinea-pig (Sah et al. 1988; French, Sah, Buckett & Gage,
1990). First, in the majority of dissociated CA1 neurones,
inactivation was very slow (time constant of inactivation
onset, 7·4 ms at −20 mV; 22—24°C), while rapid inactivation
comparable to that reported in the present study was found
only in a subset of cells (time constant, 0·9 ms at −20 mV;
Sah et al. 1988). Second, the mid-point potential of the
steady-state inactivation curve was more negative in
dissociated neurones (V½ = −74·9 and −67·6 mV for the
slowly and the rapidly inactivating channels, respectively;
Sah et al. 1988) than in nucleated patches from slices (this
paper). Finally, a persistent TTX-sensitive Na¤ current
(distinct from the window current generated by overlap of
activation and inactivation curves) was reported in
dissociated CA1 neurones (French et al. 1990; see Alzheimer,
Schwindt & Crill, 1993), but was not detected in the present
study. The reasons for these differences are not entirely
clear. The absence of a persistent current component in
nucleated patches is, however, consistent with previous
estimates that its contribution to the total Na¤ current is
small (< 1 %; Crill, 1996).

Diversity of Na¤ channels in the nervous system

Although the prevailing view is that voltage-gated Na¤
channels show less functional and molecular diversity than
other types of ion channels (e.g. K¤ channels; Jonas, Brau,
Hermsteiner & Vogel, 1989), differences in the voltage
dependence and time course of inactivation of Na¤ channels
between different types of neurones have been described
previously. In motor myelinated nerve fibres the onset of
inactivation is relatively slow and bi-exponential, whereas in
sensory fibres it is faster and well approximated by a single
exponential function (Schwarz, Bromm, Spielmann &
Weytjens, 1983). It was suggested that these distinct
properties of Na¤ channels may contribute to the
characteristic shape of action potentials in motor and
sensory fibres (reviewed by Vogel & Schwarz, 1995).
Differences in Na¤ channel inactivation properties between
BCs and PCs of the hippocampus resemble those between
dorsal ganglion neurones and motor neurones of the spinal
cord reported previously (Ogata & Tatebayashi, 1993;
Safronov & Vogel, 1995). In sensory neurones of dorsal
root ganglia, TTX-sensitive Na¤ channels recover from
inactivation very rapidly (time constant, 5 ms at −100 mV)

−55 mV. Pulse protocol: holding potential, −90 mV; 50 ms pulse to −120 mV; prepulse to −55 mV of
variable duration; 30 ms test pulse to 0 mV; and step back to −90 mV (see inset in C). First traces on the

without prepulse, was plotted against prepulse duration. Open circles: mean values from 6 BC nucleated
patches. Filled circles: mean values from 7 PC nucleated patches. Curves represent exponential functions
fitted to the data points; the final values reached by the curves for long time intervals were constrained to
the values of hþ at −55 mV (Fig. 3). For time constants, see Table 1.

Na¤ channels in hippocampal neurones

and the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation is
steep (slope factor, 5·2 mV; Ogata & Tatebayashi, 1993), as
found for BCs. In contrast, Na¤ channels in motor neurones
show a slower recovery from inactivation (time constants, 16
and 153 ms at −80 mV) and a less steep steady-state
inactivation curve (slope factor, 10·2 mV; Safronov & Vogel,
1995), similar to those in PCs. It was suggested that these
differences may contribute to the higher limiting action
potential frequency in sensory in comparison to motor
neurones (Safronov & Vogel, 1995).
The molecular basis of the differences in Na¤ channel gating
in BCs and PCs remains unclear. Voltage-gated Na¤ channels
expressed in the CNS are heteromers composed of principal
á-subunits (á1—á3, reviewed by Catterall, 1992; NaG,

601

Gautron, Dos Santos, Pinto-Henrique, Koulakoff, Gros &
Berwald-Netter, 1992; Na6, Schaller, Krzemien, Yarowsky,
Krueger & Caldwell, 1995) and auxiliary â-subunits (âÔ, âµ;
reviewed by Catterall, 1992). Recombinant channels
assembled from áµ-subunits show faster gating than those
formed by á×-subunits (Joho et al. 1990) and channels
containing the âÔ-subunit show faster inactivation onset and
recovery than those lacking the âÔ-subunit (Isom et al. 1992;
Makita, Bennett & George, 1996). This suggests that
differential subunit expression in BCs and PCs may account
for the functional differences observed. Alternatively, Na¤
channel gating could be affected by differential modulation.
Since Ca¥-dependent phosphorylation by protein kinase C
slows the onset of Na¤ channel inactivation (Cantrell, Ma,
Scheuer & Catterall, 1996), a differential modulation of Na¤

channels in principal neurones and interneurones is perhaps
compatible with the specific expression of Ca¥-permeable
AMPA-type glutamate receptors in GABAergic interneurones
(reviewed by Jonas & Burnashev, 1995).

Possible impact of differences in Na¤ channel gating
on the action potential pattern

The diverse action potential patterns of cortical neurones
(reviewed by Connors & Gutnick, 1990) are determined by
the interplay between voltage-gated Na¤ and K¤ channels
in combination with morphological properties and channel
distribution along the somatodendritic axis (Mainen &
Sejnowski, 1996). Previous studies suggested that these
differences in spiking patterns were largely determined by
the expression of different K¤ channels. Fast-spiking
interneurones in the stratum oriens—alveus and pyramidale
of the CA1 region of the hippocampus express voltage-gated
K¤ channels that activate and deactivate very rapidly, but
inactivate only very slowly (Zhang & McBain, 1995a, b ; Du,
Zhang, Weiser, Rudy & McBain, 1996). These specific
properties of interneurone K¤ channels ensure the rapid
repolarization of action potentials that is required for fast
spiking.
The present results reveal a more complex picture, and
suggest that the functional properties of voltage-gated Na¤
channels contribute to the differences in action potential
pattern. (1) The difference in steepness of the steady-state
inactivation curve between Na¤ channels in BCs and those
in PCs generates a different overlap of inactivation and
activation curves. Increased overlap between inactivation
and activation curves could augment the amplitude of the
slow depolarizing potential during repetitive spiking, and
thus may facilitate intrinsic bursting in CA1 pyramidal
neurones (Warman, Durand & Yuen, 1994; M. Martina &
P. Jonas, unpublished simulations). (2) The difference in
recovery from inactivation regulates the fraction of available
Na¤ channels during a spike train. Fast recovery of BC Na¤
channels supports fast spiking, whereas slow recovery of PC
Na¤ channels leads to adaptation (Fleidervish et al. 1996).
Unlike in neocortical neurones (Fleidervish et al. 1996), a
single brief depolarizing pulse was sufficient to induce
prolonged inactivation in hippocampal PCs; a long pulse or
a train of multiple pulses was, however, more effective and
induced cumulative prolonged inactivation. Thus PC Na¤
channels could enter long-lived inactivated states following
a few action potentials or even a single spike.
The differences in recovery of Na¤ channels from
inactivation between principal neurones and interneurones
of the hippocampus may shape the transformation of
synaptic input signals into action potential output signals.
BC-type Na¤ channels could facilitate the generation of
trains of action potentials that retain the precise temporal
structure of synaptic input. The fast recovery of BC-type
Na¤ channels from inactivation could also enable interneurones to fire spike doublets that may synchronize
spatially distributed principal neurone ensembles (Traub,

J. Physiol. 505.3

Whittington, Stanford & Jefferys, 1996). By contrast, the
slow recovery of PC-type Na¤ channels from inactivation
may enable PCs to differentiate synaptic input, because only
a few action potentials are generated in response to
repetitive synaptic stimulation.
If Na¤ channels in the dendrites are functionally similar to
those in the soma, the present results may imply distinct
forms of action potential backpropagation into the dendrites
of different types of cortical neurones. BC-type Na¤ channels
with fast recovery from inactivation could facilitate the
reliable backpropagation of action potential trains into
interneurone dendrites (reviewed by Johnston, Magee,
Colbert & Christie, 1996). Conversely, the expression of PCtype Na¤ channels with slow recovery perhaps explains why
in CA1 pyramidal neurones spikes occurring early in a train
propagate actively, whereas those occurring later fail to
actively invade the dendrites (Spruston, Schiller, Stuart &
Sakmann, 1995).

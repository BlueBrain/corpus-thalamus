Abstract
The intrinsic and network properties of thalamic reticular (RE) neurons, which release the potent inhibitory neurotransmitter gaminobutyric acid (GABA), endow them with oscillatory properties within the frequency range of sleep spindles (7–15 Hz), a hallmark brain
rhythm that characterizes early sleep stages. The original hypothesis that RE neurons are pacemakers of spindles, based on absence of this
oscillation in thalamocortical (TC) systems after disconnection from RE nucleus and presence of spindle rhythmicity in the deafferented RE
nucleus, is supported by new experimental results in vivo, in vitro and in computo showing that interactions through chemical synapses as well
as electrical coupling among inhibitory RE neurons lead to generation and synchronization of spindle sequences within the nucleus. Besides
their pacemaking role in spindle generation, RE neurons are crucially implicated in the inhibition of TC neurons during cortically generated
spike-wave (absence) seizures, which may explain the obliteration of signals from the external world and unconsciousness during these
epileptic fits.

1. Background
This article addresses a hotly debated issue, namely, to
what extent the thalamic reticular (RE) neurons possess
intrinsic properties and participate in local network
operations allowing them to generate and synchronize a
hallmark oscillation that characterizes early sleep stages,
spindle waves (7–15 Hz). First discovered during the 1980s,
the cardinal role played by the RE nucleus in spindles’
induction was shown by abolition of this rhythm in
thalamocortical (TC) systems after lesions of RE neurons
(Steriade et al., 1985) and, more importantly, by the property
of in vivo deafferented RE neurons to generate spindles in
the absence of cortex and the remaining thalamus (Steriade
et al., 1987a). Those data led us to postulate that RE nucleus
is the pacemaker of spindle oscillations. This idea was
challenged by the absence of spindles in slices from the
posterior (perigeniculate) part of the RE nucleus, maintained
in vitro (von Krosigk et al., 1993). However, in a Science
article (Steriade et al., 1993), the authors of the discrepant
results obtained in vivo and in vitro concluded that ‘‘spindle
oscillations are generated in the reticular thalamic nucleus
disconnected from dorsal thalamic and cortical inputs’’ (p.
684) and, concerning the failure of experiments on RE in
vitro slices to find spindles, proposed that ‘‘a larger and more
intact collection of reticular thalamic cells may be able to
generate spindle waves autonomously’’ (p. 684). More
recent experiments and computational studies on isolated
RE-cells’ networks (see Section 4) congruently led to the
conclusion that spindle rhythmicity can be produced within
the RE nucleus, without necessarily requiring inputs from
TC and cortical neurons. The idea of RE-induction of
spindle generation transcends the mechanism of this major
sleep oscillation, as it sheds further light on differences
between the intact and sliced brain (Steriade, 2001a,b,
2004).
The importance of recent investigations on RE neurons,
particularly those that demonstrate the prevalent synaptic
weight of neocortical inputs on these cells (Golshani et al.,
2001; Jones, 2002), also relates to the role played by RE
neurons in inhibiting target TC neurons during cortically
generated spike-wave (SW) seizures (Steriade and Contreras, 1995; Crunelli and Leresche, 2002; Steriade, 2003).
Seizures with ‘‘spike’’ and ‘‘wave’’ complexes at 3–4 Hz are
observed in absence epilepsy, associated with loss of
consciousness. The cortical origin of a majority of SW
seizures casts doubt on earlier hypotheses claiming that such
paroxysms are generated by ‘‘centrencephalic systems’’
(Penfield and Jasper, 1954) and on more recent in vitro data
implicating TC neurons in the generation of such seizures
(von Krosigk et al., 1993; Huguenard, 1999). The powerful
inhibition of TC neurons during SW seizures is also relevant
to mechanisms that underlie obliteration of signals from the
external world and unconsciousness during such paroxysms.
We first show the place of the RE nucleus in thalamic and
cortical circuitry (Fig. 1A). The modulation of RE neurons

by some neurotransmitters may partially explain the
differences in their behavior between isolated thalamic
slices and the intact brain. Next, we deal with the intrinsic
properties of RE neurons and their synchronization, which
provide the substrate for spindle generation within this
nucleus. Finally, we present recent in vivo and in computo
data demonstrating the generation of spindles within the RE
nucleus and the RE-induced inhibition of TC neurons during
SW seizures (see Fig. 1B). Here, we mainly refer to data
relevant to the two major topics of this article, spindle
oscillations and SW seizures. For other morphological and
physiological features of the RE nucleus, such as the
topographical organization of different RE sectors and their
relations to dorsal thalamic nuclei, the reader may consult
previous monographs and reviews (Steriade et al., 1990,
1997; Jones, 2002, 2005).

2. Morphology, immunoreactivity and connections of
thalamic reticular neurons
The RE nucleus is a derivative of the ventral thalamus
(Jones, 1985) and is entirely composed of GABAergic cells
(Houser et al., 1980). It is a relatively thin sheet of neurons
that surrounds the anterior, lateral and to some extent ventral
surfaces of the dorsal thalamus. Because of its anatomical
position, the RE nucleus is traversed by virtually all axons
connecting the dorsal thalamus with the neocortex, giving
the nucleus its reticulated appearance and name. RE neurons
have long dendrites (Fig. 2), whose secondary and tertiary
branches possess vesicle-containing appendages that form
synapses on the dendrites of neurons in the same nucleus.
The presynaptic dendritic appendages are common in cats
(Descheˆ nes et al., 1985; Yen et al., 1985), present but rare in
monkeys (Williamson et al., 1993), and reportedly absent in
rats (Ohara and Lieberman, 1985).
The cells of the RE nucleus have soma diameters of 20–
50 mm, and are generally ovoid, with relatively long
dendritic branches emerging from the poles of the soma
(Fig. 2). Even though RE neurons seem to be relatively
homogeneous from the morphological point of view, there is
evidence for functional differences. As yet, there are no
morphological correlates of the two neuronal populations of
the RE nucleus, one of which generates low-threshold spikes
(LTSs) and is able to switch from tonic to burst firing, the
other apparently lacking the low-threshold Ca2+ conductance and firing only tonically (Contreras et al., 1992). The
latter group is similar to the overwhelming majority of
neurons in the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (Crunelli
et al., 1987) that share a common embryological origin with
the RE nucleus and similarly do not project to cortex (Jones,
1985). Another example of functional, but not related to
morphological, diversity is the presence of a subgroup of RE
neurons which display intrinsic membrane bistability, likely
due to the functional expression of a persistent Na+ current,
INa(p) (Fuentealba et al., 2005) (see details in Section 3.1).

intracellularly recorded and stained in cats. Signs of excitation and inhibition are indicated by plus and minus. For the sake of simplicity, local-circuit inhibitory
neurons in cortex and thalamus are not illustrated. Insets represent the response of RE and TC neurons to cortical stimulation (arrowheads point to stimulus
artifacts). The GABAergic RE neuron responded to cortical stimulation with a high-frequency spike-burst, followed by a sequence of spindle waves on a
depolarizing envelope (membrane potential, À68 mV). The TC neuron responded to cortical stimulation (arrowhead) with a biphasic, GABAA–B-mediated
IPSP, leading to a low-threshold spike (LTS) and a sequence of hyperpolarizing spindle waves (membrane potential, À70 mV). (B) Relations between cortical
(area 4), RE and TC neurons of cat during spontaneously occurring, cortically generated seizure with polyspike-wave (PSW) complexes at 2 Hz. Note IPSPs in
TC neuron (filled circles) in close time relation with spike-bursts fired by RE neuron, driven from cortex. Modified from Steriade et al. (1993), Contreras and
Steriade (1996), Lytton et al. (1997) and Steriade (2000).

The axons of cat RE neurons are relatively thin (around
1.5 mm), but myelinated when passing into the underlying
dorsal thalamus. Within the RE nucleus, they give off two or
three short unmyelinated collaterals which end in bouton
terminals close to the cell body of origin. These boutons
contain flattened synaptic vesicles and end in symmetrical
synapses observed under electronic microscopy (Yen et al.,
1985), but in appropriate sectors of the RE nucleus some of
these probably also arise from axons of pallidal and basal
forebrain origin (Asanuma, 1994; Asanuma and Porter,
1990). Although some authors have denied the presence of
intranuclear collaterals in the rat RE nucleus (Pinault et al.,

1995), such collaterals have been found in numerous other
studies on both cats and rats (Steriade and Descheˆ nes, 1984;
Yen et al., 1985; Spreafico et al., 1988; Lubke, 1993). On
entering the dorsal thalamus, the axons of RE neurons
ramify mainly in the nucleus related to the sector of the RE
nucleus in which the parent cell lies, though collaterals are
also distributed in adjacent or even more distant nuclei.
Besides their immunoreactivity to GABA, other substances expressed in RE neurons are parvalbumin, the
CAT301 antigen, and certain neuropeptides such as
somatostatin and neuropeptide Y (Oertel et al., 1983;
Molinari et al., 1987; Morris, 1989).

2.1. Intrathalamic circuits and corticothalamic projections
The excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) elicited in a
RE neuron by stimulating the motor thalamic nucleus
(Fig. 3) exemplifies the direct projection from TC to RE
neurons, and the antidromic invasion of the motor cortical
neuron in this figure shows the return projection from the
related cortical area to the dorsal thalamus. The synaptic
activation of the RE neuron by thalamic stimulation could
also be due to axon reflex excitation of this neuron following
antidromic activation of the corticothalamic axon. The dual
intracellular recording from cortex and RE nucleus in Fig. 3
also demonstrates that spindle oscillations invariably started
in the RE nucleus.
The GABAergic RE neurons exert influences on the two
other thalamic cell classes: TC neurons and local-circuit

GABAergic cells. The latter constitute about 25% of the
total neuronal population in all dorsal thalamic nuclei of cats
and primates (Steriade et al., 1997). With the exception of
the lateral geniculate nucleus, local inhibitory neurons are
absent in dorsal thalamic nuclei of rats, a species on which
most in vitro studies are conducted. However, although the
RE–TC connection is the only projection that is generally
considered in simplistic descriptions of thalamic circuitry
and only about 10% of thalamic RE neurons project to local
inhibitory interneurons (Liu et al., 1995), the synaptic
weight of this projection is unknown and it may produce
significant effects on the ultimate targets, TC neurons.
Indeed, the projection from RE neurons to local interneurons
may eventually lead to the disinhibition of TC cells neurons.
This has been demonstrated by increased incidence of
inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in TC neurons

neuron (CX, area 4) and a thalamic RE neuron in the rostral part of the nucleus. Note synchronization of intracellular and cortical EEG activities (area 4);
however, spindles invariably started in the RE nucleus. Note also the very rich synaptic background activity in the RE neuron, compared to the cortical one.
Intracellular injection of positive current pulses identified both neurons. The cortical cell fired thick action potentials and displayed low frequency discharge,
whereas the RE neuron generated a powerful low-threshold calcium spike crowned by thin, fast action potentials. (B) Electrical stimulation of thalamic
ventrolateral (VL) nucleus identified the cortical cell as corticothalamic. Note antidromic action potential, followed by synaptic activation. VL stimulation also
generated short, fixed latency EPSP in the RE neuron, preceded by a small artifact (asterisk) due to the capacitive coupling between both intracellular
recordings. Note that the latency of the artifact in the RE neuron corresponds to the peak of the antidromic action potential in the cortical pyramidal cell (1.4 ms).
Therefore, both neurons belonged to the same functional TC circuit, involving VL, RE and cortical area 4. Unpublished data by P. Fuentealba and M. Steriade.

after excitotoxic lesions of RE perikarya, as if local
interneurons were released from the inhibition exerted by
RE neurons (Steriade et al., 1985). It was proposed that the
connection between the two types of inhibitory cells, RE and
local-circuit interneurons, subserves processes for focusing
attention to relevant signals (Steriade, 1999). Fig. 4
illustrates this hypothesis. The upper TC cell (Th-cx) in
the figure receives prevalent excitation from the afferent
fiber (Aff.) while the bottom Th-cx cells receives less
collaterals from the Aff. axon. The RE neurons that are
directly connected to the top Th-cx neuron (the top RE
neuron is part of this pool) are activated from Aff. through

collaterals of Th-cx cells and contribute to further
enhancement of relevant activity by inhibiting the pool of
local-circuit (L-circ) elements (the top L-circ neuron is part
of this pool). Simultaneously, the activity in adjacent RE
areas (bottom RE neuron) is suppressed by axonal
collateralization and dendro-dendritic synapses within the
RE nucleus. The consequence would be the released activity
of target L-circ neurons (bottom L-circ cell) and inhibition
of weakly excited TC neurons (bottom Th-cx neurons) in
areas adjacent to the active focus. The full functional
consequence of this GABAergic-to-GABAergic (RE to
local-circuit) connection remains to be investigated.

depolarizes RE neurons and thus explains, at least in part, the
differences between the in vivo results, which reported the
presence of spindle oscillations in RE neuronal networks,
and the failure of recording spindles in slices maintained in
vitro (see Section 4.1). Basal forebrain afferents arise in
cholinergic cells (less than 50% of the retrogradely labeled
neurons) and GABAergic cells (Steriade et al., 1987b;
Parent et al., 1988; Cornwall et al., 1990; Asanuma, 1997).
The afferents from the pretectum mainly arise in the
GABAergic neurons of the optic tract nucleus (Cucchiaro
et al., 1993).

3. Electrophysiology of thalamic reticular neurons
3.1. Intrinsic properties and their modulation
by synaptic inputs

Fig. 4. Relations between GABAergic thalamic reticular (RE) and localcircuit (L-circ) neurons, and their effects on thalamocortical (Th-cx)
neurons. See text for explanation of circuitry and possible functional
consequences. This hypothesis derived from a study on the activity of
RE neurons during the natural waking-sleep cycle (Steriade et al., 1986).
The circuit was proposed in Steriade (1991) and was redrawn by E.G. Jones.
Modified from Steriade (1999).

The major sources of afferent inputs to the RE nucleus are
the collaterals of corticothalamic axons (Liu and Jones,
1999). The functional predominance of cortical inputs, over
those from TC neurons, was demonstrated in a study
showing that the numbers of glutamate receptor subunits
GluR4 are 3.7 times higher at corticothalamic synapses in
RE neurons, compared to TC neurons, and that the mean
peak amplitude of corticothalamic excitatory postsynaptic
currents (EPSCs) is about 2.5 higher in RE, than in TC,
neurons (Golshani et al., 2001). This explains why
corticothalamic pathways, which are glutamatergic and
excitatory in nature, may exert opposite effects on RE and
TC neurons during the burst mode of firing. Electrical
stimuli or naturally occurring synchronous volleys in
corticofugal axons excite RE neurons and produce rhythmic
spike-bursts, whereas they induce biphasic (GABAA–B)
IPSPs in TC cells, due to the prior excitation of RE neurons
(see above, Fig. 1A).
2.2. Neuromodulatory pathways
Afferent inputs from neuromodulatory systems to the RE
nucleus arise in the brainstem and basal forebrain. The major
sources of brainstem reticular inputs arise from mesopontine
cholinergic nuclei (Pare´ et al., 1988; Raczkowski and
Fitzpatrick, 1989) and monoaminergic, locus coeruleus and
dorsal raphe nuclei (Morrison and Foote, 1986). The
monoamine projection is of importance because it slightly

There are some similarities between RE and TC neurons
in their bursting and tonic discharge modes during different
states of vigilance (Steriade et al., 1990). The bursting mode
occurs during slow-wave sleep, while tonic discharge is
detected during brain-activated states of waking and rapideye-movement sleep (Steriade et al., 1986). The two firing
modes of thalamic neurons depend on their membrane
potential (Llina´ s, 1988). At relatively depolarized membrane potentials (positive to À65 mV), intracellular injection of a depolarizing current pulse results in a train of single
action potentials, whereas intracellular injection of the same
current pulse at hyperpolarized membrane potentials results
in the generation of a high-frequency (300–500 Hz) burst of
action potentials in most RE neurons (Contreras et al., 1992,
1993; Bal and McCormick, 1993). As in TC neurons (Llina´ s,
1988), such high-frequency bursts are generated in RE
neurons by activation of the low-threshold Ca2+ current,
T-current (Huguenard, 1996).
The bursts of action potentials generated in RE neurons
are dissimilar to those of TC cells, the main differences
being their duration and internal structure. Quantitative
analyses of spike-bursts fired by thalamic neurons during
natural slow-wave sleep (Domich et al., 1986; Steriade
et al., 1986) showed that bursts in TC neurons (5–20 ms in
duration) display 3–5 action potentials, whereas more than
90% of bursts in RE neurons are longer than 50 ms and
contain 5–8 or more spikes. The intrinsic burst structure is
also different in these two thalamic cell classes. While
spike-bursts in TC neurons show a progressive increase in
interspike interval duration, RE neurons display a decrease
followed by increase in interval duration, called accelerando–decelerando pattern (Domich et al., 1986; Steriade
et al., 1986) that was ascribed to the dendritic location of
T-currents in RE neurons (Destexhe et al., 1996). The
secondary depolarizing component of cortically evoked
EPSPs in RE neurons (Contreras et al., 1993) may also
shape their spike-bursts. This component occurs as an allor-none event at about 5 ms after the peak of the initial

EPSP and is voltage-dependent, being most prominent
between À70 and À85 mV and greatly reduced or absent at
more hyperpolarized levels (Fig. 5A). The secondary
depolarizing component is sensitive to QX-314 in the
recording micropipette (Fig. 5D), suggesting that INa(p)
contributes, together with the dendritic activation of
T-currents, to this component of cortically evoked EPSPs
(Fuentealba et al., 2004a). The secondary EPSP affects the
integrative properties of RE neurons, including their
spiking output and temporal summation of incoming
cortical inputs. Thus, the early component of EPSP
generates stereotyped spikes at short and fixed latencies, at
relatively depolarized values, while the secondary depolarizing component triggers spikes with widely variable
latencies at more hyperpolarized values, around À70 mV
(Fig. 5B and C).
The accelerando–decelerando pattern of spike-bursts in
RE neurons is often followed by a prolonged tonic tail of

single, tonic spikes. This tail was originally described
using extracellular recordings in naturally sleeping
animals (Domich et al., 1986; Steriade et al., 1986) and
was also recently reported with intracellular in vivo
recordings (Fuentealba et al., 2005). The presence of this
long tail of tonic spikes is related to the expression of
membrane bistability in a subpopulation (20%) of RE
neurons, and seems to be relevant not only for the intrinsic
activity of RE neurons but also in sculpting the patterns of
spindle oscillation in the thalamus (Fig. 6). Actually,
intracellular recordings of TC neurons show the existence
of at least two different spindle patterns. In the first, TC
neurons exhibit cyclic, powerful sequences of waxing and
waning IPSPs originated from the RE nucleus (cell 2 in
Fig. 6). At the end of IPSPs’ cycles, a strong rebound is
generated and crowned by action potentials. The second
pattern is much more irregular; it does not show clear

of every cycle (cell 1 in Fig. 6). Modeling studies (Fuentealba
et al., 2005) showed that the discharge patterns in TC neurons
produced by intrinsic bistability in RE neurons could
contribute to generate less and less spikes in rebounds of
TC cells, therefore contributing to terminate spindle waves in
the thalamus (Fig. 7). This possible way of spindle termination
may act together to the two other proposed mechanisms. One
of these factors is the Ca2+-dependent increased activation of
the hyperpolarization-activated cation current, IH (Bal and
McCormick, 1996). This would result in a relative refractory
period during which the propensity to generate synchronized
oscillations is markedly reduced. Another mechanism for the
termination of spindles would depend on the desynchronization of thalamic oscillatory activity, due to LTS’ generation
with different delays from the onset of IPSP and/or to strong
depolarizing cortical inputs onto thalamic neurons, which

Fig. 7. Membrane bistability in thalamic RE neurons may contribute to the
termination of thalamic oscillations. Computational models predict that
membrane bistability of RE neurons (see experimental data in previous
Fig. 6) modulates patterns of spindle oscillations in TC neurons. Shown are
four RE and four TC neurons from a one-dimensional simulated thalamic
network of connected cells (26 RE and 26 TC) during active periods of
thalamic oscillations. The different patterns of activity in RE neurons had a
differential effect on target thalamic neurons, depending on the connectivity
in the reciprocal network. The two RE neurons in the top are classic (nonbistable) ones, while the two at the bottom were modeled with the inclusion
of a persistent Na+ current (INa(p)), which results in the expression of
membrane bistability. Note that TC cells receive projections from multiple
RE neurons; therefore, the final effect on spindling pattern was a combination between those multiple inhibitory inputs. Accordingly, TC neurons
receiving preferentially projections from non-bistable RE neurons displayed
robust, regular oscillations, with rebound spike-bursts in most cases (two
upper traces). Conversely, TC cells receiving inputs mainly from bistable
RE neurons showed irregular rhythms, associated with very low rebound
discharges (two lower traces). See similar patterns in the previous figure
with experimental data. In fact, the spatio-temporal pattern of activity in the
modeled thalamic network showed some TC neurons that were hyperpolarized and did not fire during the active periods of this type of thalamic
oscillations (not shown). This suggests a possible contribution to the
termination of spindles. Modified from Fuentealba et al. (2005).

would prevent the generation of LTSs and thus will lead to the
spindle termination (Timofeev et al., 2001).
The graded nature of LTSs in RE neurons was
characterized in vivo (Contreras et al., 1993) and depends
on the distal dendritic localization of T-channels coupled
with the constant synaptic bombardment of dendritic arbors
by network activity. Intracellular recordings in RE neurons
in vivo revealed small-amplitude (3–7 mV) potentials that
are different from EPSPs and probably represent regenerative events originated in the distal dendritic arbor. These
presumed dendritic spikes could be triggered by intracellular
current injection, by synaptic activation of excitatory inputs
or by the depolarizing waves of spindle sequences
(Contreras et al., 1993). They also occurred spontaneously,
as single events or bursts (400 Hz). The dendritic spikes in
RE neurons trigger LTSs and produce somatic depolarization as well as depolarizing potentials in more distal
dendrites.

The spike-bursts of RE neurons are significantly
prolonged during the transition from normal sleep behavior
to epileptic seizures (Steriade and Contreras, 1995).
The ongoing synaptic background activity powerfully
modulates membrane properties of RE neurons, including the
LTSs. This was studied by means of in vivo intracellular
recordings during periods of intense synaptic activity,
represented by spindle waves (Fuentealba and Steriade,
2005). At resting conditions, Vm distribution of RE neurons
was dominated by silent states, corresponding to single-peak
histograms at hyperpolarized levels (around À75 mV). RE
neurons showed low-pass filter properties, strongly dumping
frequencies higher than 10 Hz, the main component of spindle
waves. During spindles, the massive activation of T-currents
generated powerful LTSs which dramatically changed Vm of
cells (by 10–20 mV) and increased membrane fluctuations in
one order of magnitude, from 1–3 mV to 10 mV (Fig. 8A and
B). The generation of LTSs reduced the apparent input
resistance up to 80% for 20–30 ms, in a cyclic way (Fig. 8C).
These changes in basic membrane properties proved to be
functionally significant for RE neurons, since both synaptic
and intrinsic responsiveness were enhanced during active
network states. Thus, synaptic responses tested by stimulating
corticothalamic pathways showed increased spiking
responses; the same result was found for intrinsic responses
tested by positive and negative current pulses, as well as
sinusoidal wave currents (Fuentealba and Steriade, 2005).
In sum, the voltage-dependent dendritic channel distributions in RE neurons provide them with properties for
integration of cortical inputs that are the most powerful
among afferent excitatory signals (Golshani et al., 2001).
Compared with the effects these inputs exert on TC neurons,
at which level dendritic currents generate high-frequency
rhythms (Pedroarena and Llina´ s, 1997) that define brain
alertness, the parallel activation of RE-cells’ dendrites by
synchronized cortical volleys produces low-frequency
oscillations (Contreras and Steriade, 1996) that characterize
the disconnected state of slow-wave sleep.
3.2. Neuronal substrates of synchronization within the
reticular nucleus
The two ways through which RE may synchronize their
rhythmic activities within the nucleus are GABAergic
synapses and the more recently revealed electrical coupling.
Initially, the presence of oscillations within the in vivo
deafferented RE nucleus was ascribed to an avalanche of
IPSP-rebound sequences at 10–15 Hz, through dendrodendritic GABAergic synapses, which could start in any
point of the RE neuronal network and spread to adjacent and
distant neurons (Steriade et al., 1987a). However, the belief
from some in vitro studies, which did not focus on spindles
but on ‘‘epileptiform’’ activity, was that reciprocal inhibitory
connections among RE neurons act as desynchronizers, thus
preventing thalamocortical synchrony (Huntsman et al.,
1999; Huntsman and Huguenard, 2000). Nonetheless, a

study from the same laboratory acknowledged that the slow
time constant of evoked IPSC decay in RE neurons is
consistent with studies of spindle synchrony in an
interconnected network of inhibitory cells (Zhang et al.,
1997). Actually, computational studies using minimal or
more realistic ionic models of isolated networks of
GABAergic RE neurons (Wang and Rinzel, 1993; Destexhe
et al., 1994a; Golomb et al., 1994) have corroborated our
hypothesis that mutual GABAergic inhibition between RE
neurons can synchronize them into spindle-like oscillations.
In modeling studies, synchronous oscillations of ‘‘cluster’’
states were similar to those described in the in vivo study in

134

P. Fuentealba, M. Steriade / Progress in Neurobiology 75 (2005) 125–141

which spindles were only found in distinct foci of the RE
nucleus, supposed to contain dendritic bundles (Steriade
et al., 1987a). Subsequent experimental studies demonstrated that, at the relatively hyperpolarized levels of slowwave sleep, the IPSPs resulting from contacts among RE
neurons can be reversed and computational work revealed
that GABAA-mediated depolarization can generate persistent spatio-temporal patterns of spindles in the isolated RE
nucleus (Bazhenov et al., 1999).
Another, non-exclusive mechanism of spindle synchronization within the RE nucleus is the electrical coupling by
gap junctions. The first evidence came from an in vitro work
(Landisman et al., 2002) that, surprisingly, did not find
evidence for chemical GABAergic synapses within the
nucleus, though this is commonly reported by all
morphological and electrophysiological studies. The electrical coupling in RE nucleus depends on the expression of a
connexin protein, Cx 36, and its features are similar to those
of most electrical synapses that have been studied in
vertebrate nervous systems. Further in vitro (Long et al.,
2004) and in vivo (Fuentealba et al., 2004b) experiments
also showed that many RE neurons are interconnected by
electrical synapses. In our study, spontaneously occurring
spikelets, which are characteristic of central neurons that
are coupled electrotonically via gap junctions, occurred
spontaneously during spindles and during interspindle lulls.
Spikeles are much smaller than action potentials (common
amplitude ratio, 1:50). They are significantly different from
EPSPs (Fig. 9) and also distinct from fast prepotentials
(FPPs) that are presumably dendritic spikes generated
synaptically. That spikelets and EPSPs were different events
resulted from two major features. Firstly, spikelets had much
faster rising and decaying phases than EPSPs. Secondly,
spikelets were unable to elicit full action potentials, even
during states of membrane depolarization close to firing
threshold, whereas EPSPs led to cell firing at the same level
of depolarization (Fig. 9B). As to FPPs, their amplitudes
were much greater than those of spikelets, and their timecourse was also different. In contrast to spikelets, FPPs were
mainly present during periods of membrane depolarization
(Fuentealba et al., 2004b). Spikelets were strongly reduced
by halothane, a blocker of gap junctions (Fig. 10).
The relatively strong filtering properties of electrical
connections between RE neurons exclude fast events as
spikes, but favor the synchronization of low frequency
events, such as LTSs and slower oscillations. This means
that, together with chemical GABAergic synapses, electrical
coupling might synchronize oscillations in the range of
spindles, which are mediated by LTSs (Fig. 11).

4. Generation of spindles in the thalamic reticular
nucleus
We will first briefly present the initial data, demonstrating
the presence of spindle rhythmicity in the in vivo

deafferented RE nucleus, and the different factors that
may account for the failure of recording spindles in isolated
RE slices maintained in vitro. Next, we will present recent
data from in vivo and in computo studies providing new
arguments for the generation and synchronization of
spindles within the RE nucleus, as well as the wider
synchronization of this oscillation in TC and corticothalamic
systems.
Spindles are sequences of waxing-and-waning waves at
frequencies of 7–15 Hz, which recur periodically with a
frequency of 0.2–0.5 Hz. Although TC neurons are inhibited
during spindles and are therefore unable to transfer
incoming signals to the cerebral cortex, thus disconnecting
the brain from the external world, spindles are operational in

producing synaptic plasticity within the thalamus and
neocortex, which may underlie consolidation of memory
traces acquired during the state of waking (Steriade, 2003;
Steriade and Timofeev, 2003).
4.1. Presence of spindles in the in vivo deafferented
reticular nucleus and factors accounting for absence of
spindles in slices of reticular nucleus
The in vivo study that initially reported the presence of
spindles in the deafferented rostral pole of the RE nucleus
performed transections that separated the RE nucleus from
cortex and the remaining thalamus, but left intact an island,
medio-ventrally, through which some projections from
brainstem monoamine-containing neurons might have been
intact (see Fig. 2A and C, in Steriade et al., 1987a). The
disconnection of RE nucleus from the dorsal thalamus,
which was later hypothesized to contribute to spindles’
initiation (von Krosigk et al., 1993), was complete, as
verified histologically. As to neocortex, earlier experiments
have shown that it is not necessary for the generation of
thalamic spindles (Morison and Bassett, 1945). The island
medio-ventral to the rostral pole of the RE nucleus, through

135

which brainstem monoaminergic could survive, is significant because these projections exert a depolarizing action on
RE neurons (McCormick, 1992; Steriade et al., 1997), a
factor that favors spindle generation within the RE nucleus
(see below) since the resting membrane potential of RE
neurons is slightly more depolarized in vivo than in vitro.
Nonetheless, all computational studies on this topic agreed
that spindles occur even in completely isolated networks of
GABAergic neurons (see below). In the in vivo preparation
(Steriade et al., 1987a), spindle oscillation was observed in
circumscribed territories of the RE nucleus and contrasted
with the absence of spindles in the remaining thalamus and
cortex. Along the same microelectrode track, more dorsally
or ventrally explored areas did not display spindling, which
led to the proposal that spindle activity was prevalent in
those RE areas in which highly concentrated dendritic
bundles are present (Steriade et al., 1987a). In vitro
experiments, however, failed to record spindles in the
isolated visual (perigeniculate) sector of the RE nucleus
(von Krosigk et al., 1993). Some factors accounting for this
failure are as follows.
The cut for slices maintained in vitro leads to a less intact
collection of RE neurons (see note 13 in Steriade et al.,
1993) by partially mutilating the long dendrites of these
neurons. The role of dendrodendritic inhibitory contacts
among RE neurons in spindle generation has been initially
hypothesized (Steriade et al., 1987a) and the dendritic
location of LTSs in RE neurons was demonstrated
(Huguenard and Prince, 1992) together with the presence
of spike-bursts in presumed dendritic recordings from RE
neurons (Contreras et al., 1993). That the dendrites of RE
neurons are implicated in the bursting properties leading to
spindles was demonstrated in an in vivo, in vitro and in
computo study (Destexhe et al., 1996) showing that, in
contrast to RE cells with intact dendritic arborizations in
which there is a high density of low-threshold transient Ca2+
currents, RE cells in which most of the dendritic
arborizations were removed have a much lower density of
ITs. These data support the initial hypothesis postulating that,
in the deafferented RE nucleus, the de-inactivation of the
low-threshold Ca2+ conductance in dendrites gives rise to
spike-bursts and hyperpolarization of postsynaptic dendrites
in synaptically coupled neurons, eventually leading to an
avalanche of IPSP-rebound sequences at $10–15 Hz,
distributed throughout the RE nucleus (Steriade et al.,
1987a).
The idea that a collection of RE neurons more intact than
that normally found in a thalamic slice may give rise to
spindles is supported by modeling studies, based on
intracellular recordings in vivo, showing that only transient
oscillations could be obtained in a network smaller than
25 Â 25 RE neurons, while larger, two-dimensional networks population produced oscillations with a frequency
around 10 Hz, like spindles (Bazhenov et al., 2000). This
difference emphasizes the requirement for numerous RE
neurons in producing synchronized oscillations.

induced in the postsynaptic cell (red lines) by a single spike in the presynaptic neuron (black lines). Upon hyperpolarization of the presynaptic neuron (second

induce a delayed spike-burst in the postsynaptic cell. Bottom trace represents intracellular recording of RE neuron in vivo, showing the similarity with the
prediction of the model. Inset, clusters of high-frequency spikelets preceding low-threshold spike. (B) Wave dynamics in two-dimensional network of RE

cells are shown in red, silent neurons indicated by blue. Note the propagation of the wave of activity, mediated by electrotonic contacts. From Fuentealba et al.
(2004b).

Additionally, modulatory systems arising in the brainstem are absent in thalamic slices. The depolarization of RE
neurons by monoamine-containing systems (see above)
promotes the sensitivity of RE neurons to the IPSPs
generated by intra-RE GABAergic connections, with the
consequence of generating spontaneous oscillations within
the frequency range of spindles (Destexhe et al., 1994b). In
that simulation study, RE neurons, organized with dense
proximal connectivity, were examined in a hyperpolarized
state (À65 to À75 mV), similar to the in vitro condition
when no monoaminergic synapses are activated, and in a
more depolarized state (À60 to À70 mV) that would
correspond to a weak monoaminergic activity. In the more
depolarized condition, RE neurons exhibited spindle-like
rhythmicity, whereas at more hyperpolarized levels the
oscillatory behavior was absent. Thus, an adequate level of
monoaminergic-induced depolarization may change the
state of isolated RE neuronal networks, from silence to
spindle oscillations. Surprisingly, no experimental study in
vitro was conducted during the past decade to test this
possibility.
Besides the depolarization induced by monoaminecontaining neurons, cortical depolarizing inputs to the RE
neuronal network may reinforce its intrinsic propensity to
generate spindles. Earlier (Steriade et al., 1972) and more
recent (Contreras and Steriade, 1996) studies have indeed
demonstrated that the most efficient way to trigger spindles
is to activate corticothalamic projections that reach the distal
dendrites of RE neurons. This action is also exerted by
stimulating the contralateral cortex, to activate callosal and

corticothalamic projections, thus avoiding antidromic
activation of TC axons and collateral activation of RE
neurons (Steriade et al., 1972). The callosal-corticothalamic
pathway has recently been confirmed through intracellular
recordings (Cisse´ et al., 2003).
4.2. Recent data supporting the generation of
spindles in reticular nucleus
Experiments in our laboratory have supported the idea
that spindle oscillations are locally generated in the RE
nucleus. Intracellular recordings of RE neurons performed
in vivo showed that in 30% of cases spindle oscillations are
preceded by a long-lasting hyperpolarization (Fig. 12).
Corticothalamic volleys were also effective in generating
such hyperpolarizations followed by spindles in RE neurons
(Fuentealba et al., 2004c). A drop of up to 40% in the
apparent input resistance was associated with these
hyperpolarizing potentials, suggesting an active process
rather than disfacilitation. Accordingly, the reversal potential was around -100 mV for both spontaneous and cortically
elicited hyperpolarizations, consistent with the activation of
slow K+ conductances in these cells (Ulrich and Huguenard,
1996a,b). QX-314 in the recording pipettes decreased both
the amplitude and incidence of prolonged hyperpolarizations, suggesting the participation of G-protein dependent
K+ currents in the generation of hyperpolarizations (Hille,
1992). Simultaneous extracellular and intracellular recordings in the RE nucleus demonstrated that RE neurons
discharged during the hyperpolarizations and, thus, may be

implicated in their generation (Fig. 12). The prolonged
hyperpolarizations preceding spindles may play a role in the
transition from tonic to bursting firing of RE neurons within
a range of membrane potential (À60 to À65 mV) at which
they set favorable conditions for the generation of lowthreshold spike-bursts that initiate spindle sequences. These
data are further arguments for the generation of spindles
within the thalamic RE nucleus. Additional evidence was
provided by intracellular recordings and computational
models showing that when RE neurons are hyperpolarized
below the ClÀ reversal potential, synaptic excitation
mediated by GABAA receptors can lead to low-threshold
Ca2+ potentials crowned by Na+ spikes (Bazhenov et al.,
1999). This mechanism is able to produce propagating
patterns of spike-burst activity, which also develop into selfsustained oscillations. This has also been supported by
modeling studies showing that spiking-bursting activity in
the RE nucleus might initiate sequences of spindle
oscillations in thalamic networks (Bazhenov et al., 2000).

During spindles, the rising phase leading to spike bursts
in RE neurons is often preceded by high-frequency events of
small amplitude, presumably EPSPs arising from spikebursts from TC neurons (Mulle et al., 1986). These EPSPs
are mainly mediated by non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors, since application of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptor
antagonists results in block of spontaneous and evoked
spindle waves (Bal et al., 1995) and NMDA components of
cortically evoked responses in RE neurons are negligible
(Gentet and Ulrich, 2004).
The synchronization of spindles over widespread
thalamic and cortical territories is different in vitro and in
vivo. Thus, in contrast to the nearly simultaneous spindle
sequences seen in the thalamus and cerebral cortex in vivo,
in acutely prepared animals as well as during natural slowwave sleep in cats and humans (Contreras et al., 1996, 1997),
spindles propagate along the dorso-ventral axis of the lateral
geniculate nucleus in slices from the visual thalamus of
ferrets, maintained in vitro (Kim et al., 1995). We
hypothesized that the contrast between the simultaneity of
spindle sequences in the intact brain and spindle propagation
in thalamic slices was due to the absence of the cortex in the
latter, simplified preparation. In fact, after decortication, the
simultaneity of spindle sequences throughout the thalamus
is disorganized without, however, showing systematic
propagation as in thalamic slices (Contreras et al., 1996).
Also, compared to the simultaneous occurrence of spindle
oscillations in the functionally intact brain, a diminished
spatiotemporal coherence of spindle oscillations was
observed during barbiturate anesthesia, when corticothalamic neurons display poor spontaneous activity, as well as
during states of depressed cortex, produced by releasing a
drop of highly concentrated K+ acetate over the cortex
(Destexhe et al., 1999).

5. Reticular neurons and inhibition of
thalamocortical cells during cortical seizures
In essence, seizures with SW complexes at 3–4 Hz, as in
absence epilepsy, are generated intracortically, and RE
neurons faithfully follow each paroxysmal depolarizing shift
(PDS) of neocortical neurons, which leads to inhibition of
TC neurons (Steriade and Contreras, 1995) (see Fig. 1B).
The opposite view, namely the intrathalamic generation of
SW seizures (von Krosigk et al., 1993), was expressed in
studies conducted in vitro, with isolated thalamic networks
and absence of connections with the cerebral cortex. Also, in
those in vitro studies (von Krosigk et al., 1993), the so-called
‘‘SW seizures’’, obtained by bicuculline injections in the
thalamus, consisted in slowed (from 8 to 3 Hz) and regularly
recurring spindle sequences, but not in paroxysmal

138

discharges. The slowing of spindles (but not SW seizures)
after thalamic injection of substances blocking inhibitory
processes, such as penicillin or bicuculline, has been earlier
(Ralston and Ajmone-Marsan, 1956) and more recently
(Steriade and Contreras, 1998) reported.
The role of neocortical neurons in generating SW
seizures was first proposed (Steriade, 1974) on the basis that
such paroxysms are focally detected in the cortical depth,
sometimes without reflection at the cortical surface. In those
experiments on behaving primates, tonic eye movements
were associated with SW seizures at their onset and end, as
in clinical absence epilepsy. The minimal substrate of SW
seizures is the neocortex as they occur after thalamectomy
(Steriade and Contreras, 1998). After disconnection from the
thalamus in monkeys, cortical SW seizures were associated
with impairment of awareness (Marcus et al., 1968),
indicating that such seizures, accompanied by behavioral
signs similar to those occurring in human absence epilepsy,
may be generated in the absence of the thalamus. Multiple
extracellular and intracellular recordings of neocortical
neurons demonstrated the progressive intracortical build-up
of SW and polyspike-wave (PSW) seizures, which are
sequentially distributed through corticocortical circuits
(Steriade and Amzica, 1994), reaching the thalamus only
after 5–8 s (Neckelmann et al., 1998). This indicates that
SW/PSW seizures originate within the cortex and are
transferred to the thalamus only after a series of intracortical
synaptic operations.
Simultaneous recordings of cortical and RE-neurons’
activities revealed that spontaneous cortical SW seizures
around 3 Hz are associated with spike-bursts in RE neurons,
which follow each PDS in cortical mass potentials and are
much longer ($200 ms) than before seizures (Steriade and
Contreras, 1995). The same study used simultaneous
recordings of cortical field potentials, RE-cell’s unit
discharges and intracellular activity of a TC neuron to
show that, during cortical seizures with SW complexes at
3 Hz, the faithful following by RE cell of each cortical EEG
‘‘spike’’ is associated by IPSPs in the TC cell. In sum, then,
GABAergic RE neurons participate actively during cortically generated SW seizures (Steriade and Contreras, 1995),
which is corroborated by the increase in the ionic current
underlying spike-bursts of RE cells in such seizures
(Tsakiridou et al., 1995; Avanzini et al., 1999) and the
fact that the Cd2+-induced blockage of RE-cells’ spikebursts leads to a decrease in the ipsilateral SW activity
(Avanzini et al., 1992).
The opposite, i.e., steady hyperpolarization and phasic,
multiple IPSPs that do not lead to de-inactivation of spikebursts, occurs in TC cells during cortically generated SW
seizures (Steriade and Contreras, 1995). Thus, TC neurons
do not transfer spike-bursts to the cortex. Similar findings on
TC-cells’ inhibition were reported in studies on animal
models with inherited absence seizure, the genetic absence
epilepsy in rats from Strasbourg (Pinault et al., 1998;
Crunelli and Leresche, 2002), though the seizures investi-

gated in this model are somewhat different since their
frequency is twice higher (6–9 Hz) than in SW seizures of
cats and primates. Here, a methodological issue should be
stated, namely, only intracellular recordings can answer the
question whether or not TC neurons burst during SW
seizures as, with extracellular recordings, the so-called
‘‘spike-bursts’’ reported in some studies on SW seizures may
just represent brisk firing of single action potentials due to
prevalent excitation of TC neurons by corticofugal inputs
during the depth-negative component of SW complexes.
Such an activity does not, however, reflect LTSs deinactivated by hyperpolarization of TC neurons since,
intracellularly, these were trains of single action potentials at
a depolarized level, triggered by depolarizing corticothalamic projections (see Fig. 7, B1, in Steriade and Contreras,
1995). Then, this firing pattern reflects excitation of TC
neurons from cortex, rather than postinhibitory rebound
spike-bursts.
Dual simultaneous intracellular recordings from the
cortex and thalamus, in vivo, show that, during cortically
generated seizures consisting of SW/PSW complexes at
2–3 Hz, most TC neurons display a steady hyperpolarization
as well as phasic IPSPs, closely related to the ‘‘spike’’
component of cortical SW/PSW complexes (Fig. 13). At the

Fig. 13. Thalamocortical (TC) neurons are inhibited during cortically
generated spike-wave seizure, and display phasic IPSPs but not spikebursts. (A) Depth-EEG from cortical area 4 and intracellular recording of
TC neuron from cat ventrolateral (VL) nucleus. Note hyperpolarization and
phasic IPSPs in VL neuron throughout cortically generated spike-wave
seizure. (B) Dual intracellular recordings from area 4 cortical neuron and
TC neuron from VL nucleus, together with surface- and depth-EEG from
cortical area 4. The spike-wave and polyspike-wave seizure developed,
without discontinuity, from sleep-like EEG patterns. Note paroxysmal
depolarizing shifts (PDSs) in cortical neuron, and phasic IPSPs related
to cortical PDSs. Also note that, during a brief period of quiescence in
cortical seizure (arrow), the hyperpolarization of TC neuron was removed
and the neuron fired single action potentials. Modified from Steriade and
Contreras (1995) and unpublished data by M. Steriade and D. Contreras.

end of the cortical seizure, TC neurons fire at high rates, as if
they were released from the inhibition that occurred during
the seizure. Similarly, following repetitive IPSPs related to
cortical paroxysmal discharges, during a short period of
quiescence of cortical activity occurring within the SW
seizure, the TC neuron fires single potentials (Fig. 13B). The
source of inhibition in TC cells should be searched in
GABAergic RE neurons that fire spike-bursts during each
PDS of cortical neurons (see Fig. 1B).
In conclusion, during cortically generated SW seizures,
TC cells are steadily hyperpolarized and display phasic
IPSPs that do not de-inactivate the LTSs. The inhibition of
TC neurons, with increased membrane conductance, may
explain the obliteration of signals from the external world
and unconsciousness during these paroxysms.
